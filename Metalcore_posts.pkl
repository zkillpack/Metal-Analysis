VAs someone who is entirely open minded when it comes to music, I am interested in what you enjoy listening to that isn't affiliated with the metal genre.\u000a\u000aFor example, one of my most favorite songs ever has to be [Breathturn by Hammock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rENnKECnfs)\u000a\u000aWhat about you?

VJust like that other question we had a couple of hours ago. What album didn't caught your attention once it came out but then after you gave it some time it grew on you?\u000a\u000aFor me it was Issues self-title and Beartooth's 'Disgusting'. For Issues I thought they were trying to hard to make everything work but then I gave it another chance and now I love it. For Beartooth I don't know why I didn't like it at first but now I've had it on repeat recently.\u000a\u000aWhat about you?

sVAlex from Northlane is amazing
p44
VBit of a longer story but I am so stoked on what happened. \u000a\u000aNorthlane is touring with August Burns Red and they stopped by my city for a show, and normally I just show up and buy tickets at the door but to my surprise after waiting in line, the show was sold out...\u000a\u000aSo feeling distraught I am standing on the corner of the street outside the venue with my girlfriend feeling like an idiot for not buying a ticket prior to my favourite band (northlane) coming to town and am now thinking to myself I am going to miss out on them. \u000a\u000aI see Alex the bass player from northlane walking towards me coming out of a tour bus and as he walked by me I got his attention, shook his hand and told him my situation and asked if there was anything he could do. He told me to wait where I was and would see if he could figure something out...\u000a\u000aHe walks back out with his tour manager and two VIP band access passes and tells us to clip them to our pants and just follow his lead. So here we are walking right into the venue following Alex right through security and into the show where I finally got to see them live, which was absolutely amazing. \u000a\u000aNorthlane has gotten me through some pretty tough times in my life and have motivated me unlike any other bands in a long time. Having this happen to me was sick! \u000a\u000aTL;DR: stupidly didn't buy tickets and found out the show was sold out. northlane snuck me and my girl inside and had an amazing night.

VIt's the end of February which means it's time to nominate March's Artist of the Month! Each month we feature a band here in /r/Metalcore as a way to shed some light on the artist.\u000a\u000aFor the next few days we will have this nomination thread open.

VWondering what everyone here thinks of them in general, an idea on why they seem to annoy so many and is their new stuff gonna be their Restoring Force? Personally I used to like them a bit. The slower tempo more breakdown heavy stuff got old after a while, Tyler's cleans aren't great and Barrier and Villains do this stuff a bit better but aren't as big as they should be. Let Down is still a jam though.

sVWhat was your Metalcore journey like?
p97
VThe other day as I was walking to class, I was shuffling through my iPod only to have it choose "If I'm James Dean, You're Audrey Hepburn" by Sleeping With Sirens. I have now outgrown all whiny, heartbreak-core bands so I hit next which skipped to a Kublai Khan song (I can't remember which) and I couldn't help but realize that my taste in music was like some metaphorical black hole, which only drags me deeper into heaviness as i get older. I noticed that the amount of time I have listened to metal is directly proportional to the heaviness of the music that I currently listen to. I wondered if everyone else was like this; getting progressively heavier in their metal tastes as they lived day-by-day. Main point... I am posting this discussion because I want to hear the musical journeys of anyone who wants to share. Not really looking for a specific format. Maybe just what you started with, what phases you went through, and just whatever you feel like sharing. Maybe I'll find some new material to jam or maybe I'll just be entertained for the moment. Thanks!

p167
VHey everyone, I've had trouble lately trying to find new bands that sound similar to the stuff I listen to. I know there is a list in the sidebar but I'm looking for a little bit of a different answer. The bands I listen to are pretty mainstream, and I was looking to find more underground stuff that is similar. I listen to bands like Periphery, Crown The Empire, Northlane, Issues, TDWP, BMTH, Amity. I don't know if these bands are a separate genre from typical metalcore but I like a nice balanced mix of cleans and uncleans. I'm not really a fan of those deep throaty growls the entire song. Are these bands considered metalcore and if so what would you guys recommend for me to take a listen to based on what I like? Periphery is one of my favorites so far, I love the uniqueness they bring to the table, although I haven't been able to find many bands like them.

From all I've seen  about them, the music its self and Caleb being a total badass it seems like they are definitely in the scene to stay. The question here is do you think they are becoming the future of the scene, and where do they go from here? they seem to be pushing tour after a tour, and it seems like everyone already knows them only a year in.

sVAny newer vocalists out there with aggressive sounding cleans?
p366
VI have been scouring the vast land that is the Internet for newer metal bands that have aggressive, raspy, fucking harsh clean vocals. I'm not talking about just screaming; I'm talking about M. Shadows-"City of Evil"-era-raspy or Chester Bennington-in-his-prime harsh. It's almost like they're screaming but they sing a melody at the same time. It's fucking awesome. If reference is needed, check out the [vocal isolated track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDJ1WpXIjY0) of Crawling. \u000a\u000aSome other good vocalists that are up there with this sound for me are Bjorn Strid from **Soilwork**, Phil Anselmo of **Pantera**, Corey Taylor of **Slipknot**, etc.\u000a\u000aIt's an absolute gem if the band has awesome guitar work too, but I've decided unique vocals are what really hook me to a band. So if any of you guys have any recommendations I'd love to hear them!

VI don't know if this is the appropriate sub for this. If it is not, please let me know. \u000a\u000aI bought this oil on canvas a while ago at a charity shop. Really liked the thickness of the paint and uneasy feel. Later I noticed it was signed Bannon and tried to see if I could figure out the artist. I thought maybe it was by Jacob Bannon, perhaps something he did in school or later. I think his wiki stated that he sold paintings to pay bills. I've always wondered and was hoping someone here may be familiar with his earlier work.\u000a\u000aHere is the link http://imgur.com/a/4QcXK\u000a\u000aUPDATE: I emailed him and he replied back that is is not his art.

sVWhat would you guys consider a newer "classic" in the "AP" / warped scene?
p389
VSky, the bassist of Issues posed that question to his followers on twitter and I thought it was pretty cool, so I'm moving that discussion here. To elaborate, I'm asking an album on par with Chasing Safety, one that will be held to that regard that came out recently. \u000a\u000a\u000aI understand that there probably aren't a whole lot, but we can also discuss why those albums are held to such standard. I'd say my choices are Homesick for metalcore and TDAGARIM by Brand New for more that style.
p390
sVAlbums I might have missed as an ex-fan of the genre?
p391
VYo so I used to listen to metalcore a few years ago (and the music I listened to then I still do now), but kinda fell out of the scene. I was listening to BMTH, TDWP, Eatmewhileimhot!, A Skylit Drive, Attack! Attack!, Asking Alexandria, bands like that. As far as these bands go I do NOT like new BMTH or Asking Alexandria for the record. I generally lost interest in metalcore because the newer albums that were being pushed sounded generic or boring to me. I mostly listen to progrock and mathrock type stuff now, but what have I missed that you think I might like? Of mice and men formed right around the end of my metalcore 'career' so I know bout em but was never super into em.

p403
VHey everyone, so I really need your advice... \u000a\u000aI'm a metalcore/post-hardcore music enthusiast girl who loves going to concerts. I went to a wild Parkway Drive show over the summer and got a pretty bad concussion from getting kicked hard in the head (on my left side) by a crowd surfer who snuck up on me from behind(I presume he had some enormous feet with some sort of heavy duty shoes on). I was watching Parkway Drive behind about 5 rows of people in the front, near the center of the floor at the time I got the concussion. I suffered tremendously from the post-concussive syndrome and finally seem to have recovered after ~6 months. After that incident, I've been trying to avoid live shows because I'm so afraid of getting a concussion again. I don't mind getting bruises and cuts from concerts (I actually love the wild, crazy metalcore concert scene), but I can't take any more chances with a blow to the head. \u000a\u000aDespite my acute fear, I couldn't resist but to get the tickets to go see Stick To Your Guns (with The Amity Affairs, In Hearts Wake, Being As An Ocean, and 68). STYG and TAA are amongst my favorite metalcore bands of all time, and I just couldn't afford to miss this show. They will be playing at a very small venue (with capacity of like 300-500). I've never seen a metalcore show at a tiny venue before so I don't know what to expect. I'll be going there with a good guy friend.\u000a\u000aHow can I avoid getting a concussion, while still being able to enjoy the show in a small venue?? I don't typically like the balconies because the crowd up there are kind of lame and boring. They don't have all the energy as the people on the floors (especially in the front). Please hit me up with some of your tips &amp; advices!!\u000a

sVMosh/circle pit/f...ight dancing...?
p441
VSo, went to ABR and miss may I show tonight. Both bands did well. Good show.\u000a\u000a\u000aI am the type of fan who likes to get a little jumpy, a little moshy during shows, especially during heavy songs that have good rhythms, break downs, solos, whatever. \u000a\u000a\u000aWell, I realized tonight I have not been to a legit metal core show since parkway drive, at the same venue, almost exactly one year prior. That show was rich with stage diving (and being caught on the other end), circle pitting (as the singer called us out and forced us), and general mashing. All of those elements were clicking hard. Such a masterful show, masterfully hyped up by the band... There was an air of comraderie, mutual respect, and you could tell everyone was satisfied with the active fandom which sometimes manifests upon a metal core concert hall.\u000a\u000a\u000aWell, tonight there was none of that. \u000a\u000aI've seen MMI four times. Always been a sick pit.\u000a\u000aI've seen as I lay dying, TDWP, slayer,megadeath, destroy the runner, lamb of god, bullet for my vspot, in flames, all that remaons, architects, architect, war of ages, bring me the horizon.... And many more. Never have I ever actually felt offended at the state of the pit! Of active fandom, of all the little fucking fight dancers. \u000a\u000a\u000aWhere the fuck did the courteous pit go? The kind that they are out to have fun. If you getvpushed over someone helps you up immediately. The kind that was not so sparse that the circle pit did not look like a bunch of kids running in a circle. The actual mosh pit, instead of fight dancing, and actively attempting to hurt someone...\u000a\u000a\u000aIt just was not how I liked I guess. Or maybe I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to be. But I also refuse to go without attempting to mosh. I'm just not looking to get punched in the face either.\u000a\u000aFuuuuuuuhhhhhhh

Idk guys, i hate it because i love the scene but i feel less passionate about it. Has anyone else felt this way?

sVRedditors in Bands(doesn't have to be MC), can I get some advice/opinions? (Tl;dr included!)
p540
VHey /r/Metalcore! Hope everyones day is going well! I wanted to come here and ask for some opinions and advice from fellow redditors who are musicians in the metal(metalcore scene), so hopefully i'm not missing any rules against this or anything! \u000a\u000aMy name is Dylan I am currently 16, I live in Ohio and i'm a vocalist. Currently I am able to do both Clean and Aggressive vocals(I lean more on aggressive since I prefer them with my voice), I have recently the last couple months been attempting to start a band in the metalcore/post-hardcore scenes. I have had one full "attempt" at a band so far that fell out didn't work and I would like some advice!\u000a\u000aBeing in my part of Ohio, there isn't that many metalheads that are more then vocalist. The original line up for my failed attempt of a band were two friends from school a guitarist and drummer who both weren't committed, and basically would bandwagon and only be apart if I started getting popular. Being my age I also am unable to drive far to the local scenes Dayton, Cincinnati, and mostly rely on social media for networking and connections.\u000a\u000aI personally plan on learning instruments so I can be more useful then just a voice and lyrics(I really just want to help everyone and do as much as I can). I've been suggested by my cousin (who is a popular Hip Hop/Rap beat maker, to possibly me and him work together for a little demo with electronic instruments he can set up and use that as a start up/kinda a sound gage for how my vocals are and such.\u000a\u000aWhat advice can you guys give me for trying to find people who are not only interested in actually committing to it, but also ways to better connect in my current situation(being 16, unable to drive far to meet others all the time, etc)? Any advice is appreciated! Thank you and have a wonderful day!!!\u000a\u000aTl;dr "Unable to find musicians locally that aren't vocalists(I kinda got that part), aren't able to travel to the local scene often, but I really really wanna make music and perform and just have fun!

sVTrying to get back into the genre, have some questions.
p591
VBack in highschool, this kind of music was all I would listen to but I eventually grew out of it. Lately I've been going through my old itunes and getting back into some of my old songs. I tried listening to the newer bands and even some bands that I once loved and something just feels... off. Miss May I isn't nearly as heavy and Levi sounds like he lost his voice, The Devil Wears Prada is all serious now and he also sounds like he lost his voice, Attack Attack is gone, and Attila just seems like a parody of themselves now. Basically my question is; are there any bands out now that are still making fun, aggressive, and breakdown heavy music? Every song I listen to seems so serious compared to the scene when I was a part of it. 
p592
sVTommy Giles most versatile vocalist?
p593
VListening to BTBAM's Parallax II and am blown away by Tommy's versatility. He's screams are phenomenal but his ability to actually sing is what really wins me over. So I ask do you think Tommy has the most 'weapons' to work with vocally or is there another vocalist out there I should listen to?\u000a\u000aI'm not the biggest BTBAM fan, but my understanding is that Tommy does all the vocals. So if I'm wrong in that thinking... oops, sorry.

I might use Northlane's instrumental of Singularity, but I'd rather look for other songs first. \u000a\u000aAnother example of what I'd like is a lot of the intros to The Amity Affliction's songs, especially Weigh Down and Geoff Sux 666.

I'm about to be 23 so I was just getting into this genre of music around the time I was 13-14 and bands like Underoath, TDWP, PWD, etc. were really starting to get big. Still Remains was among these and then after their last album (The Serpent I think) came out, they just dismembered? anyone know the backstory or can further explain to me what happened? \u000a\u000a*p.s. fuck you Mason King if you see this.

sVGuilty Pleasure aspects of a song
p679
Vyes, I know this has been asked, but that was like a year ago and new people and music are here. \u000a\u000amy guilty pleasure aspect is definitely the thundering, pounding drums - especially from Life Cycles (TWA). There are plenty of songs on that record that just go hard and the drums and bass are just ridiculously chuggy and I love it. Paired with Telle's screams, it makes from some simple but pleasant breakdowns and I just love listening to them with the bass all the way up in my car. Makes long drives pleasurable.\u000a\u000awhat are yours?

p755
VAfter some soul-searching, I've come to the realization that I might like Metalcore. However, perusing this subreddit has shown me that in order to call yourself a "true Metalcore fan" and not get shat over by other fans, you must not like certain bands/styles in the genre. A common thing I see on this sub is disdain for "whiny" or high vocals, for instance. \u000a\u000aThe thing is, I don't know why. I've taken a listen at some bands which embody this hated style, and I truly truly cannot see *why* they're hated. Maybe I have shit taste: but my musical taste is pretty well-developed, I like to think. I haven't listened to radio/pop shit in damn near a decade and listen to a pretty wide variety of genres. \u000a\u000aI just don't get it when I hear a song, like it, and then find out that everyone hates it (and its band) for some completely un-discernible reason. I don't mind high-pitched male singers, for instance, but apparently liking a band with them is a mortal sin here. \u000a\u000a

Unfortunately, their recent setlists have been almost exclusively that. And since the reissue will be out by then. I'm almost certain the mediocre-at-best new tracks will find a way on the setlist as well. I just hope I get to hear Second &amp; Sebring, at least. Thoughts?

VSo, as far as metalcore-type music goes, I love stuff like Asking Alexandria, The Amity Affliction, Trivium, Periphery, Crown the Empire, etc. Also notable, I enjoy listening to thrash metal (Megadeth, Metallica, etc.) as well as some post-hardcore (Falling in Reverse, Pierce the Veil). I'm looking to get into some new bands in the genre, or in similar styles. My only "stipulation" is that the band has to have some clean vocals, otherwise it's not something I'm gonna be able to get into. Any suggestions?

sVWhere should I go to submit myself for metalcore bands?

p885
VI tried to leave the title vague in the small chance my Redditor boyfriend sees this. \u000a\u000aIn November of 2014 Attila (one of our favorite bands for years) had a signing at my local record store and my boyfriend and I went and hung out (it wasn't terribly busy) and talked to Attila. Chris Fronzak even found the store manager to ask him if they had any more copies of Guilty Pleasure as we couldn't find any to buy. My boyfriend bought a CD and had them sign it and we went to their show that night, it was overall a great experience. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, less than two weeks later my boyfriend's car was stolen from my university (3 hours away from his home) and everything was taken. Floor mats, spare tire, loose change, trash, and the newly signed CD. Four days later it was found about 30 miles away with a smashed driver's side window and other minor damages.\u000a\u000aI'm reaching out to /r/Metalcore because his birthday is coming up soon and I'd like to contact Attila (I haven't found a suitable method besides through their manager, which may end up being the best idea) to see if they would be interested in helping me make his birthday very special. \u000a\u000aIf anyone would like proof, I can PM you pictures.\u000a\u000aThank you so much kind people, any help is appreciated!

I've been playing for a long time, but only recently have I started to take it seriously, and I have a lot of ideas in my head to record and what not, but when I try and transfer them to guitar, I get "finger"-tied. Sometimes when I try and speed up a riff or make something a little more complex, my fingers can't keep up.\u000a\u000a\u000aDoes anyone have any tips or little exercises I can work on? Anything is appreciated. :)

VI went to the Frozen Flame show last night headlined by August Burns Red, but mostly there for Northlane and MMI. I tried crowd surfing for the first time during the MMI set, and in the front row, I was getting dropped. You could tell it was a matter of time before I went down, but I felt someone tugging on my arm. Looked up, and sure enough, it was Levi Benton. \u000a\u000aHe grabbed my forearm and pulled me up onto the stage. In the middle of possibly their biggest hit (Relentless Chaos), he put his arm around my shoulder, looked at me, and said something along the lines of 'don't worry man, I gotchu' and kept going with the song after striking a pose with me and holding my fist up. \u000a\u000aThe guitarist came towards me, shook my shoulder, and said something, wasn't sure what (it was too loud to hear him). After that, I jumped back into the pit. Pretty damn cool for my first time crowd surfing. After the show, Levi was hanging out beside the stage like he was the entire show rocking out to the other bands, and I was just walking out of the venue, didn't even notice him there.\u000a\u000aHe shouted out to me something like 'hey black and red shirt, come here man!'. I walked over there, and he asked if I was the one that nearly ate shit. I was like 'yeah, thanks for saving my ass'. We talked for a minute, asked if I had a good show, told him he rocked it, blah blah blah. He ended it with 'well I should get backstage to hit the road again. Good talkin' bud, can I count on seeing you at our next Edmonton show?' Of course I was like hell yeah, and he responded with 'awesome, we can always use some badass fans like you. Stay metal man' and walked away. Had to be the coolest, down to earth frontman I've ever met, best experience at a show of my life **by far.**\u000a\u000a**TL;DR:** Levi Benton of MMI saved my ass in the pit and pulled me up to rock with 'em, then struck up a conversation with me after the show, forever securing my respect.

(There is no live version of PBR for whatever reason) \u000a\u000aBasically, what I'm asking is if I should compare myself to his studio level (sometimes I get close; most times I sound like old Mike Crafter shit from IKTPQ), because I'm really frustrated.\u000a\u000aThoughts? Tips? Positive reinforcement? Anything?

sVTo the subreddit
p1078
VI browse this subreddit a few times a week, mostly just to lurk. But I'd just like to say you all are probably one of my favorite communities on reddit.\u000a\u000aEvery time I open a thread about someone trying to find new music or related bands that a user might enjoy people are so eager to jump in and help someone out and with respect as well. Almost every time someone says "Oh I like these bands: X, Y, Z" they usually come out of it with an entire list of bands to try out.\u000a\u000aNobody bashes anyone for liking one band and another doesn't, everyone has their own tastes and by the looks of it everyone here understands and respects that.\u000a\u000aAlso, it seems that it has a strong potential to bring people together, if someone mentions a show it seems like a really good possibility at least *someone* that comments in the thread might have been at the same show.\u000a\u000aKeep it badass guys, love it.\u000a\u000aP.S. Also something I should have mentioned is that the Mods are on top of it and really active... great work fellas.
p1079
sVWhy do so many bands' screamers/harsh vocalists not do any clean vocals?
p1080
VOkay, okay, hear me out here. I used to think that many bands separated the harsh and clean vocals because maybe the harsh vocalist wasn't naturally a very good singer, and someone else in the band was. Makes sense. \u000a\u000aHowever, I've been attempting to learn to growl (it's going okay) and one of the interesting things I've learned is that a lot of proper screaming technique actually improves your singing as well, and vice-versa. In fact, I've improved more at singing than I have at growling. Now, I'm not going to go audition for The Voice or anything, but I think my singing is now good enough to do choruses and such in an extreme metal band. Which makes me wonder: guys who are much better screamers than me must also be better singers, because their technique is better. So why do many of them not sing at all?\u000a\u000aThe only other reason I could think of would be so that the singer and screamer can overlap each other, which is definitely musically interesting. However, many bands with separate screamers and singers rarely or never do this anyway.

p1087
sVHow do you listen to your music generally?
p1088
VJust curious. I used to be a hardcore iTunes user, buying albums off the store and ripping CDs and all that, but lately I've just been using Spotify. Premium subscription is only 5 bucks a month for students, and it's just super convenient. I can find new stuff really easy, and I have access to basically everything I wanna listen to. \u000a\u000aEDIT: I too am no stranger to piracy. I do feel bad about it sometimes, but I do try to purchase albums legally if I really love the artist, and now that I've mainly switched to Spotify, I feel a bit better about it. I also go to LOT'S of shows, and I buy quite a bit of merch. But to each his own, and I'm glad that at least artists are getting known a lot easier, due to piracy.

p1102
VHey guys. I'm here to ask for your help. I'm not a dedicated listener. I started lifting while listening to hard rock, but when my weights went up, so did my taste in music during my workouts.\u000a\u000aI need your recommendation for the songs. \u000a\u000a|But why don't you look at similar bands and look at their songs|\u000a\u000aI did, but it's hard to find something when i'm not exactly know what i am listening too.\u000a\u000aExamples:\u000a\u000a[In hearts wake-healer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44pTQe4Q9lg) This song is number 1 into pushing myself to the limit.\u000a\u000a[Confession-asthma attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIRgnTTvaM)\u000a\u000a[The Amity Affliction - Give It All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLhDKKw421E)\u000a\u000a[Obey The Brave - Raise Your Voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iktRYDKJn-Q)\u000a\u000aI don't know if you noticed, but i need that CLICK on the main part ( i think it's called chorus part).\u000a\u000aFor example songs like( recently posted on the wall):\u000a\u000a[The amity affiction: FML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQWwH04zdjQ) chorus part doesn't motivate me, it's kind of soft. \u000a\u000a[Forevermore - The Wager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyDpo522aw) This song has the opposite effect. I don't know if it even has a chorus part and if it has it's too aggressive for me.\u000a\u000aEven if In hearts wake- healer is my main song. I don't listen to their other songs, well only In hearts wake- afterglow a little, but by far Healer is my top1.\u000a\u000a\u000aCould you, good people, point me at least in the direction i should search for my lifting music? or throw away some possible songs for me?

VI'm just curious on what everyone is listening to at the current moment. My favorite Metalcore album at the moment is Creation/Destruction. I never gave Fit For A King that much of a chance but I saw them on the Frozen Flame tour and they killed it. In the Non-Metalcore category I've been digging Have Mercy's [A Place of Our Own.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7xJ9CuSf3U&amp;list=PLKAm0swRNcktiRCMnfpoQ-7aA1TrFA0Sv) It's definitely a change of pace but I love the emotion I can hear in the music.

What is it?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMine would go like this:\u000a\u000a[A Day to Remember - Have Faith in Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WMmCtkhWi0)\u000a\u000a[Silverstein - Massachusetts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGCJ6tksOdA)\u000a\u000a[Erra - Dementia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ9Ae6x_XA8)

sVCan anyone recommend me some songs that have a glitch-like effect on the vocals?
p1145
VI don't know how to explain it, or if there's a term for it, but I'm looking for songs where the vocals are edited in a way I can only describe as "glitchy" like something out of a dub step song. I'm on mobile so I can't link but I do know a few examples.\u000a\u000aTranscending Dimensions - Northlane (around the end: "it can be our world")\u000a\u000aEarth - Make Me Famous (about a minute in:  "drowning in your drink") \u000a\u000aMenace - Crown the Empire (about 2:30 in: "you can't take my life away")\u000a\u000aThose are the only ones I can name but if anyone has any other examples, I'd appreciate it.

sVNon-christian bands similar to for today?
p1156
VI like for today's music, style, break downs, etc. But I don't really like the christian lyrics. I don't hate christians or their belief at all, I just don't believe it myself, and I don't want to listen to music with people preaching about god and such. I have nothing against people who do that, its just not my cup of tea.

p1173
VI have a ton of school work to do this week and I like to listen through full albums when I do it. Unfortunately, I have run out of ideas as to what to listen to. So, give me what you've been listening to lately. Preferably smaller bands since I've also listened to the major bands in the genre many times. It also doesn't have to be exclusively metalcore, I'm open to all -core genre recommendations. Oh, and I'd prefer if it was on spotify rather than youtube or whatever, just makes it easier since thats what I use.

sVAm I the only one who loves and uses /R/Metalcore as a way to find amazing up and coming bands but see's it more than often recognizing the already greats but leaving the future to the genre in the shadows?
p1188
VAs much as I love the founders of the genre, I just get hungry and want more so I look at this subreddit to find not the base metalcore chit-chat but to see the bands that are small or unknown, a band that I can take a journey with as they grow (Everyone has had that one band that they have followed into greatness) and I feel as if this subreddit does not take chances and only upvotes the same TDWP, ABR, KSE and PWD. There are bands innovating the future of Metalcore and as much as I like seeing the great, I would love to see the soon to be great. \u000a\u000aAnd as everyone hates this topic, I dont care if it gets downvoted to oblivion, You would just be furthering my point. Plus if i see that same post about Issues, Beartooth, Architects and BMTH.. I will just laugh at the broken record you are playing on this subreddit.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000aDanny

sVAny albums similar to The Word Alive's Deceiver?
p1196
VDeceiver is hands down my favorite album ever. Every single song has a special meaning to me, or evokes a certain emotion, and I just enjoy it so much. I was just wondering if anyone knows of any similar albums? Hounds Of Anubis is such a solid intro-song to the album, and I get PUMPED every time I hear it come on shuffle. Thanks!

sVWhich should be the first single released by a band?
p1233
VSo, when a band is promoting their new album, which do you think should be the first single? If the first song released is the best one on the album, we may end up disappointed when the album comes out. If they release one of the worst songs first, we may get a surprise when listening to the whole thing but we also may not be as eager to buy the album... Or should they just release the most accessible song if their goal is to expand their fanbase?\u000a\u000aI know different bands may have different goals, but is there a pattern here? Also, if you could give examples with your answers, that would be fantastic and interesting to read.
