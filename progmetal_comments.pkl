VSteven Wilson - Regret #9
p1
(lp2
VThis album is bloody brilliant, but you really have to listen to Home Invasion first because the segway into Regret #9 is so nice
p3
aVvery true. This song reminds me so much of Any Colour you like by pink floyd. I guess that would make Home Invasion "Us and them". The transition really is nice, I wasnt looking at the track listing the first time and I thought it was all just one big song. 
p4
aVI was waiting for someone to post this one.\u000a\u000aFreaking awesome synth!
p5
aVHoly Shit that made me happy. Guthrie Govan lived up to his name on that solo.
p6
aVThis was the song that sold me on the album. 
p7
aVWaiting for my first Steven Wilson tour this summer. I have been listening to the new album and although not as great as Raven it is still good on a different level.\u000a\u000aEdit:- Scratch that. This album is soo damn good. 
p8
aVthe best album of this young year so far
p9
aVDid Guthrie nail that solo or what?  God damn .
p10
aVSteven never fails to deliver. Probably his best album to date.
p11
asVPeriphery joining In Flames and All That Remains for Spring North American Tour
p12
(lp13
VThat makes me want to see them at the end of their headlining tour even more. \u000a\u000aChrist that is an awful lineup, and I used to be the biggest In Flames fan too.
p14
aVI'm not a periphery fan, but I respect them. Terrible line up. 
p15
aVI'd probably go just for Periphery and leave after they finished their set. Do not dig All That Remains/In Flames in the slightest.
p16
aVWas actually planning to do just that, if I can grab a beer with those guys between sets that'd make up for the other two bands.
p17
aVJust throwing it in there but, In Flames is a ton of fun live. One of the best live bands I've ever seen. 
p18
aVYeah, new In Flames is obviously not the greatest, but it was so worth it to see them live! They still rip through Clayman, Only For the Weak, Cloud Connected, Take This Life, and other assorted songs that got me into them. Incredible live show. Shame about their new stuff :(
p19
aVI may be the only person who doesn't dislike their newer stuff. I were a bit disappointed at first but it has grown on me. I feel a lot more connected to the albums as a whole when listening to their new music (3 latest) versus their old. It's hard to explain but when u listen to their old stuff I find these "Holy shit this is a good song" and in their new there's more a "Holy shit this makes sense". \u000a\u000aFor example Take This Life is a real killer song but Paralyzed from their newest album is a wonderful song which fits perfectly with the rest of the album. 
p20
aVWell I have to admit I haven't given Siren Charms many spins. There are no original members left after the departure of Jesper so I suppose it was inevitable that there would be a drastic shift in style. I thought Deliver Us was an incredibly strong track from SOAPF, but I was disappointed in the rest of the album. Siren Charms seemed to be a bit of the same stuff so I just didn't have the patience for it. I, unlike many IF fans, did quite enjoy A Sense of Purpose
p21
aVATR plays a fair amount of their older stuff, and I LOVED them in high school (The Fall of Ideals/Overcome era), so I would have to go see them just to sate my interest in seeing them just once. In Flames though? Bah. 
p22
aVMan, I really wish school didnt get in the way of me seeing Periphery on their headlining tour...\u000a\u000aI only really enjoy In Flames older albums. I have seen them 4 or 5 times by now. A lot of their new material live is really boring.  All That Remains has some decent stuff too. But, still interesting combination of bands.

asVOfficial Discussion Thread for Periphery's Juggernaut (full album stream included)
p24
(lp25
VOne thread of conversation I'd like to have is identifying thematic elements that recur, or any similar passages between the songs. There's been a couple obvious ones so far that I'll put at the top of this list, feel free to let me know when you find more, and I'll edit them into this post with credit! Bonus points for obscurity ;)\u000a\u000aEDIT: Now with links to timestamps, check it out for yourself! Always interesting to see the context of each reference, placements in the individual songs and the albums as a whole, rather than just hearing random snippets of music and not knowing where in the song they came from. I've added others' contributions, feel free to let me know if you find more, I'm super curious. I tried to arrange the list so that songs that are tied together are grouped together consecutively on the list, rather than jumping around willy nilly, but there's still some jumping. If you don't wish to click all the links I've embedded, /u/Oglethorppe has streamlined the process and compiled [many of them into a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCEStZIzdpY&amp;feature=youtu.be).\u000a\u000a\u000a1.) **A Black Minute/Reprise/The Scourge/Psychosphere** - [Black Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw#t=40) and [Reprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHDT6XC27g#t=28) have the same opening vocal melodies, which also appears in the [opening section of Psychosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRBkVp_bB_E#t=61), as well as \u000ain a slightly more cheerful form at the end of The Scourge (around 4:20). Sorry, can't link to the stream for The Scourge, the youtube version cuts out the last minute or so! -credit in part to /u/hoosiermetal, pointed out Psychosphere to add to the list!\u000a\u000a2.) **A Black Minute/Reprise/Omega** - In the opening section to A Black Minute, the [vocal melody at 1:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw#t=59) has the lyric "Embrace the feeling of our human skin". In Reprise, this melody [shows up at 1:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHDT6XC27g#t=65) with the lyrics "I'll learn the feeling of a soul within". Finally, the melody makes another appear appearance in [Omega at 9:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQiuc06jIU#t=559), this final time with the line "Embrace the feeling of a soul within". This especially is interesting showing the character's change and growth through the story. -credit to /u/Oglethorppe for the heads up, although I had to do some of the grunt work tracking it down in Reprise ;)\u000a\u000a3.) **A Black Minute/Graveless/Priestess** - The outro section [beginning at 3:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw#t=203) in A Black Minute is also heard towards the [end of the bridge in Graveless at 2:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4TCGGMRJE#t=164). At first it's sort of buried under all the vocal layers, but you can pick it out as recognizable. Furthermore, this reappears quietly right at the [end of Priestess at 4:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8SvF8MLrHI#t=277), just a single guitar line playing the melody softly. Cool find! -credit to /u/amongstravens and zac tiessen, along with /u/ntLKM adding additional info.\u000a\u000a4.) **Reprise/Heavy Heart/Rainbow Gravity** - First appearing in the lead guitar line [around 1:05 in Heavy Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEygCZ4LrEA#t=67), the motive reappears behind the vocals in Rainbow Gravity during the choruses (first heard quietly buried in the [mix at 1:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POtsMdLISs#t=99), and much more [prominently at 3:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POtsMdLISs#t=232)). Later in the albums, it shows up again at [:36 in Reprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHDT6XC27g#t=39), beginning on the words "Death has come". -credit to /u/randyoung for helping me flesh out this entry!\u000a\u000a5.) **Psychosphere/The Scourge/Four Lights** - The epic explosion [at 2:30 in The Scourge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VURtvVKyGU#t=149) brings with it an angular, stepwise, and steadily pulsing guitar melody. This melody comes back in a big way at the [end of Four Lights, at 1:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fji7XbhQ-P0#t=101). This is interesting that this section in Four Lights has a melody from The Scourge, but a rhythm guitar part that comes back in Omega (see next entry). Finally, there is another quick appearance of this melody [in Psychosphere at 4:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRBkVp_bB_E#t=256). At 4:08, there is a break where a guitar plucks single notes with delay, when this phrase repeats at 4:16 the recurring melody is added in. -credit to /u/hazgarv and /u/ntLKM\u000a\u000a6.) **Four Lights/Omega** - The rhythmic riff at [1:40 in Four Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fji7XbhQ-P0#t=101) shows up in a faster version subdivided in 16ths rather than triplets at [1:30 in Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=90). -credit to /u/Oglethorppe\u000a\u000a7.) **Omega/Alpha** - [Chorus from Alpha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-BFadGJ3Kc#t=55) occurs again at the [end of Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQiuc06jIU#t=608).\u000a\u000a8.) **Alpha/The Bad Thing** - In The Bad Thing, the vocal lines ["fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breath"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0#t=73) occur in Alpha [during the growled bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-BFadGJ3Kc#t=219). They have been changed to add a word, to "fly past the *withered* trees, ascend to holy air and breath". -credit to /u/Oglethorppe\u000a\u000a9.) **The Bad Thing/22 Faces** - In 22 Faces, a vocal line in the bridge ["Tearing a hole inside, I'll bury your life"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUeWJjZB_nQ#t=152) appears as well in the [chorus to The Bad Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0#t=119). -credit to /u/Oglethorppe\u000a\u000a10.) **22 Faces/Stranger Things** - The vocal [chorus to 22 Faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUeWJjZB_nQ#t=44) shows up at around [2:06 in Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=125). The melody is modified just a tiny bit, but it's generally the same intervals and in the same key.\u000a\u000a11.) **Stranger Things/Psychosphere** - [Psychosphere at 2:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRBkVp_bB_E#t=141) has a harmonized vocal line "sadistic aura" that reappears in [Stranger Things at 3:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=219). Same vocal melody and layered harmonies, but the words have changed to "majestic aura". Pretty cool that the opening and closing tracks of each album have elements in common with each other. -credit to /u/Oglethorppe, and /u/blakarmor725 for a bit of correction\u000a\u000a12.) **Sranger Things/A Black Minute** - Aaaand we're back to the beginning. As a bunch of people have figured out by now, there certainly is a sense of cyclical storytelling going on in the albums (see /u/jardantuan 's post below for one such lyrical example), and that is reinforced by the 'music box' elements. The final [25 seconds or so of Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=426) are in fact the 'forward' played version of the reversed sample that is the [very opening of A Black Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw&amp;list=PLH22-xSMERQp9Jq_FLpgQ57BHZEm132Nz).  -Credit to /u/jardantuan and /u/iAmTheEpicOne\u000a\u000a13.) **Alpha/Priestess** - Near the [end of Alpha at 4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-BFadGJ3Kc#t=270), the lyrics "Step out in the rain, feel life in our veins" sort of reappear near the [end of Priestess at 3:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8SvF8MLrHI#t=237), although changed to "Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow". -credit to /u/SpongebobCuntpants\u000a\u000a14.) **Omega/The Bad Thing** - [5:10 in Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQiuc06jIU#t=308) has the lyrics "transcending boundaries of affliction", which, although dissimilar in melody or harmony at that point, is evocative of the [similar wording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0#t=85) in The Bad Thing about transcending earthly boundaries. Once again, showing progression of the character through the albums. -credit to /u/amongstravens\u000a\u000a15.) **Omega/MK Ultra** - The surprising 'elevator music' section of MK Ultra contains a couple of cool progressions and licks, one of which [occurs at 2:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGROCglsafE#t=145). This exact snippet of material also can be found in [Omega at 4:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQiuc06jIU#t=257) with a more expected guitar/drumming texture. -credit to /u/randyoung\u000a\u000a16.) **The Bad Thing/Barney** - I haven't edited this in a bit and no one's probably looking at it any more, so I'll just add this one for personal amusement. The Mraky riff in the bridge to The Bad Thing [lines up with this video of Barney Dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmDH5Z9MXGQ), which clearly is not coincidental.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aKeep them coming! I love doing stuff like this, it's like a musical scavenger hunt.
p26
aVThis is fun hehe, we did A LOT of these, and some are not as obvious as others.  It's a scavenger hunt for sure!
p27
aVWhat percentage would you say this list covers? How many are missing?
p28
aVIt makes these albums all the greater!
p29
aVI have a question, in some of the youtube comments, someone said that the jazzy part in Mk Ultra was like elevator music. It had me thinking that this part shows the passage of time from the main character being a baby to progression to a more mature state in Heavy Heart. Was that the intention? 
p30
aVHa, I just realized that if you saw that comment on yt, it was probably me (Blumenmusic), I commented about it right when the stream was put up! 
p31
aVIt might not have been haha, I was late to the Alpha party xD was killing me all day to come home and listen xD
p32
aVI know you are probably busy doing stuff and won't reply and that's cool but how does one go about creating something like this?  Is it loads of planning or is it an in the moment "This would fit thing"?  Super impressive album, you really are the top of the game at the moment
p33
aV/u/iambulb So, the beginning of Alpha before the music kicks in is the same excerpt at the end of Omega, just played in reverse. Is that a play on the verse in Revelations: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End"?
p34
aVNah.
p35
aV/u/iambulb , have you watched a show called Monster? It has some uncannily similar themes to this album! I'd recommend giving it a look.
p36
aVI'll update this as I find more.\u000a\u000a  FOUR LIGHTS/OMEGA \u000a     \u000aI'm pretty sure near the end of Four Lights, at 1:40, It's the same as the Stranger Things riff at 1:30, but played in triplet form.\u000a\u000a  THE BAD THING/ALPHA\u000a     \u000aJust lyrics, but the "fly past the [withered] trees, ascend to holy air and breath" from The Bad Thing / Alpha.\u000a\u000a  22 FACES/THE BAD THING\u000a     \u000aThe obvious one, the final line of the Bad Thing's chorus in 22 Faces, "tearing a hole inside, I'm buried alive. Dweedle Dweedle."\u000a\u000a  OMEGA/A BLACK MINUTE\u000a     \u000aOmega reprises A Black Minute as well, and possibly Reprise too, at 9:20, "embrace the feeling of a soul within," akin to A Black Minute's "Embrace the feeling of our human skin" at 1:00.\u000a\u000a  STRANGER THINGS/ PSYCHOSPHERE\u000a\u000aStranger Things at 3:43, "majestic Aura" as "sadistic horror" moment in Psychosphere at 2:23.\u000a\u000aConclusion: Holy shit this album is proggy as balls. I'm going to bed, If i find some more ill post them.
p37
aVWow, great! I haven't done a lot of lyrical comparison, so your contributions are blowing my mind. I'll add them and format mine (with credit), just want to make it all pretty.
p38
aVI think I might actually make a video with all these collections. (with credit as well, if thats fine).\u000a\u000aEdit: Here are some in video form: http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2thywk/juggernaut_recurring_themes_compilation_video/

p41
aVThe music box at the end of Stranger Things is the same as the music box at the end of A Black Minute.\u000a\u000aMore interesting though - A Black Minute opens with that same music box played in reverse. I don't have any software that could use to check this out, but it sounds like the first twenty seconds or so could be the last twenty seconds of Stranger Things played in reverse. \u000a\u000aWhich would be interesting considering some of the lyrics in Omega:\u000a\u000a    I'm lost within my own soul \u000a    A ghost within times of old \u000a    The clock turns back but is this real?\u000a\u000aAnd later in Stranger Things:\u000a\u000a    Fallen angel, you speak my name \u000a    The needle turns, the hourglass is spinning around \u000a    Give it, I want it \u000a    A sense of fucking life\u000a
p42
aVGreat! Thanks for the lyrical examples.
p43
aVI'm pretty sure the beginning of A Black Minute is the end of Stranger Things in reverse, based on the tempo and the guitar note that comes in/out of it. Im downloading audacity to reverse A Black Minute and check it out.\u000a\u000aEdit: Just reversed it and the last 25 seconds are taken from Stranger Things and reversed as the intro of A Black Minute. It's that same hollow music box sound, and the guitar note that comes in during A Black Minute is the same guitar that ends Stranger Things.
p44
aVYes to both of you, thanks for checking that out to verify!
p45
aVpsychosphere and the end of the scourge.
p46
aVPriestess 3:58 - Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow.\u000a\u000aAlpha 4:34 - Step out in the rain, feel life in our veins.
p47
aVNoted! Thanks for that, I haven't looked into a lot of lyrical similarities myself, so this is super helpful.
p48
aVThe bass line in Rainbow Gravity at some point is the outro to Psychosphere.\u000a\u000a\u000aAt least I think it is.
p49
aVCool! I'll check it out in the a.m. to get the specific times. Been thinking about going back and linking all the track times in the post to the album streams. Might take a while. Thanks for the heads up, will credit! 
p50
aVJust re listened to it, I may be wrong.\u000a\u000a\u000aThey're awfully similar though.
p51
aVOMEGA/THE BAD THING\u000a\u000aAt 5:13 in Omega, the line "transcending boundaries of affliction", which is similar to "transcend these earthly/their fucking boundaries" in The Bad Thing.\u000a\u000aZac Tiessen pointed this one out:\u000a\u000aA BLACK MINUTE/GRAVELESS " . . . 3:22-4:16 from this song is echoed in "Graveless" from 2:46-3:04 . . ."\u000a\u000aI forget which songs have it, but I know it's in Strangers Things, Four Lights and A Black Minute: the music box noise at the end.\u000a
p52
aVThat Graveless one is great, subtle! 
p53
aV&gt; A BLACK MINUTE/GRAVELESS " . . . 3:22-4:16 from this song is echoed in "Graveless" from 2:46-3:04 . . ."\u000a\u000aI noticed that the motif on Graveless one starts earlier, right when Misha do the solo 2:25. The line also appears on the end of Priestess at 4:28 although altered a bit.
p54
aVVery faint, but it's there, there's a lot of guitar layers at that point but I hear it, thanks!
p55
aVIn Four Lights, there's a melody that also appears in The Scourge, which is right at the part where Spencer screams "I HAVE NOT TRIED".
p56
aVThat is correct, nice find! It's cool that Four Lights shares a melody with one song and a rhythm with a different one.
p57
aVBlew my mind. This one was honestly the first musical theme I found shared between two songs aside from the end of The Scourge and Psychosphere.
p58
aVThat line also appears on Psychosphere on a calm part at 4:16.
p59
aVCorrect! the section at 4:08 with a solo guitar plucking out single notes with delay, on its repeat at 4:16 it adds in the recurring melody.
p60
aVRegarding #4, I believe that guitar melody is introduces in Heavy Heart at around 1:06. I didn't notice it at first but I'm pretty sure that's when it is first introduced and then repeated in Rainbow Gravity and Reprise
p61
aVAlso, the section in MK Ultra at 2:25 is repeated in Omega at 4:17
p62
aVPhenomenal! It's funny, I liked the outro to MK Ultra, but had kind of dismissed it as a 'random' interlude, it's nice that that material is just as connected as anything else.
p63
aVAll I could think of when I heard that was "Please hold. An operator will be on your call soon."
p64
aVWow, you are absolutely right, that's fantastic. It's cool that it's presented with different priority, in Heavy Heart it's a lead line, with the others it's more textural. Thanks for pointing that out!\u000a\u000aEDIT - Note to anyone reading this, /u/randyoung 's comment was in regards to the entry pertaining to Reprise/Heavy Heart/Rainbow Gravity. Since I've been shuffling the entries around to try and keep some semblance of order and connectivity, it might not be #4 any more.
p65
aVI really liked limb from limb, wasn't a big fan of sequoia throne but Ya know, can't win em all. 
p66
aVI get that this is supposed to be a joke, but I'm not sure what the joke is? Something about Protest the Hero, that I can tell...
p67
aVYou didn't mention scarlet and racecar at all.
p68
aV(They're from different albums!) However, I've been loving hearing the details of people connecting Scarlet to the juggernaut story, lyrically speaking!
p69
aVFor #11, the lyric booklet actually says "sadistic aura", so it's a much more obvious connection between Psychosphere and Stranger Things
p70
aVGreat, glad the lyrics booklets are in circulation! Thanks for the correction, let me know if you come across anything else.
p71
aVYou were wrong, I was still looking at this thread. It's not a coincidence. The Periphery members are all huge Barney fans and made a riff that synced up with his dancing. 
p72
aVI especially like the part in the albums where Barney kills all the cult members, then goes to hell.
p73
aV**Psychosphere / The Bad Thing** - [4:46 in Psychosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRBkVp_bB_E#t=286) is where the grand, dark closing riff of the Alpha record commences.  Today when this part came up, I found myself subconsciously singing the line "Fly past the trees..." from [1:12 in The Bad Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sNIbcqxYL0#t=72) and it clicked--these two parts link together; in theory they can practically be laid over one another.  The key and the pacing are different, but the parts are complimentary to one another and the low chugs almost syncopate with the Psychosphere outro riff.  I feel like this motif has to be employed elsewhere.  I'll have to just let the connection come to me...
p74
aVAre we still doing these? The vocal verse at 5:10 in Omega (Transcending boundaries of affliction...) shares a similar melody with the verse at 3:20 in Stranger Things (exhale your death and feel life...)
p75
aV*A Black Minute/Psychosphere*\u000a\u000aThe main clean riff in and the lower bell hits in A Black Minute are similar to the lead layer at 5:03 in Psychosphere. Didn't see it in the master list.
p76
aVIt may be just me hearing things, but in Heavy Heart the riff that starts at around 0:23 is replicated at 2:10 in 22 Faces. 
p77
aVStranger Things/Psychosphere\u000a\u000aStranger Things has the line, "Take in my breath and lock eyes with a world once absent of your love". Psychosphere has the line, "Strip away all the empathetic feeling towards the world that's grown absent of all my love." \u000a\u000aThis not only is a connection between the songs lyrically besides "Majestic/sadistic aura", this could also him that they're from different perspectives.
p78
aVThe riff at 1:41 of four lights is a slightly different and slower version of the riff at 1:29 in stranger things\u000a\u000aEDIT: I just realized that someone already found this lol
p79
aV* MK Ultra/Hell Below : the riff on MK Ultra starting around 0:17 sounds similar to Hell Below at 2:06\u000a* The Scourge/Alpha   : a bit obvious, the rhythm part of the beginning of The Scourge is 'altered' on middle section of Alpha 2:58\u000a* Psychosphere/Stranger Things : maybe a bit far fetched, the groove at 3:16 sorta make  an appearance on Stranger Things at 3:19
p80
aVLet's talk about the absolutely glorious bass tone on this album. Nolly knocked it out of the fucking park. 
p81
aV'Tis the dopeness.
p82
aVOmega - Omega
p83
aVI'm gonna say it. Best Periphery song. I said it.
p84
aVThat Alpha chorus repeated at the end. Goosebumps every time I hear it. 
p85
aVThey really need to make this their closing song for concerts.
p86
aVMy dream periphery set list would start with alpha and end with omega, definitely. 
p87
aVI think it's about 5 minutes in where I REALLY begin enjoying it. I love how it's almost like the character is asking for forgiveness from some external thing, then he gets denied, so he accepts himself.\u000a
p88
aVJesus Christ the outro to that song taught me the meaning of 'face-melting'. So heavy.
p89
aVReignited my love for them after losing it sometime after P2. Instrumental side is amazing, Spencer's vocal writing continues to diminish the overall creative vibe with lackluster pop melodies. His screams are on point, though.
p90
aVSee the vocals contrast with the heaviness and make it great for me.
p91
aVI think everyone knew that Periphery was becoming more and more intricate and technical with their songwriting, but Omega shows off just how Proggy they have become/can be.
p92
aV[deleted]
p93
aVAlpha - 22 Faces
p94
aVThe very last iteration of the chorus where everything changes is absolutely gnarly. Drums go half time, guitars do the Tony Danza dissonance thing, Spencer gets just a bit rougher. It's all just distorted or twisted, but still recognizable as the chorus.
p95
aVthis is probably my favorite part of the whole album, musically. I love those Danza riffs, and the chorus riff was already amazing without it. Revisiting it josh travis-style was the best decision they could have done :D
p96
aVProbably my favorite bit of guitar work on the album is during the chorus. Such a fun lick. 
p97
aVSpencer went fucking ham on this song
p98
aVOmega - Stranger Things
p99
aVThe falsetto in the first verse is my new favorite 'spencer moment'.
p100
aVIt's so unexpected, but so fulfilling. 
p101
aVI legitimately thought they got Cedric from the Mars Volta for that part. It's so like, un-Spencer-like. But I love it. 
p102
aVSpencer fucking murdered this song. I love the second time he says:\u000a\u000a&gt;BLOOD IS SPENT\u000a\u000a&gt;A TOKEN FOR MY SACRIFICE
p103
aVThis song is so good. I'd love to see it live.
p104
aVThis is actually my favorite thing they've ever written. Omega is great and all but this song really hits hard and every melody is on point.
p105
aVThat little sweeping/tapping/whathaveyou (I'm not a guitarist) part at 2:05 behind Spencer's vocals (in the tune of 22 Faces!) gives me a musical boner.
p106
aVAlpha - Rainbow Gravity 
p107
aVCan't forget that greatest Bulb solo of all time. So good. 
p108
aVThe start of this song is probably my favorite thing out of both albums. So crunchy. 
p109
aVThe way the vocals and notes are accentuated in that song probably makes it my favorite on the album. Also 3:52, that slight pause and recurring delay riff sends chills down my spine
p110
aVReading up on the theory behind the name, interesting stuff, basically gravity and spacetime are energy dependant, so different wavelengths of light will be affected by gravity differently. \u000a\u000aSo If you were to look at a black hole, if rainbow gravity is true, instead of white light being drawn into the hole, it'd be a rainbow. \u000a\u000aNot sure what it has to do with the story yet, but it might be that rainbow gravity also implies that the universe may have no beginning. Maybe that ties in with the end of omega being the beginning of alpha. 
p111
aVin the alpha video the game title is rainbow gravity, and the houses all show different points in time, maybe this indicates a reference to the relationship between time and rainbow gravity.\u000aor something. I could be rambling. but i think there's some point of the story in all that.
p112
aVI'm pretty sure it also has something to do with Thomas Pynchon's novel [Gravity's Rainbow](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity's_Rainbow).
p113
aV[deleted]
p114
aVI think this one is my favourite. Does it refer to Global warming? It felt similar to the song from P2 (I think it was muramasa) as far as lyrics go.
p115
aVCool to hear the vocal part Spencer did in the Juggernaut Webisode in context of the song. One of my favorites.
p116
aVCan any music nerds give me a hint as to the key changes used in the solo?  It sounds like it starts off in C# (pentatonic) minor but from there I kind of get lost.  
p117
aVAlpha - MK Ultra
p118
aVA.k.a. Zygrolox 2.0
p119
aVHonest to god I had an attempt at deciphering the lyrics, and believe me, they're fucking cool. Some crazy instilling the devil inside a kid kind of shit. Absolutely mental song.
p120
aVI get a total SikTh feel from it and I love it!
p121
aVLet's not forget that elevator jazz exit from the song! Is it reintroduced later in omega? I thought it might have been, could be wrong
p122
aVThe catchiest harsh chorus i've ever heard. In fact, the only.
p123
aVOmega - Priestess 
p124
aVMost emotional song Periphery has created yet. One of the best on the double album.
p125
aVI can not get enough of this song. It's seriously so good... Alpha for didn't really do it for me as a whole album even though I definitely jam some tracks so I was pretty hesitant on my approach to omega but I am so blown away by this. 
p126
aVYeah, I love both albums. But, Omega takes the cake on it's overall completeness. Juggernaut definitely might be entering my top 3 albums of all time, if my love for it doesn't wear off.\u000a
p127
aVWhat are the 2 other albums?
p128
aVFortress - PTH\u000a\u000aThe New Mythology Suite - Sym X\u000a\u000a
p129
aVYes! What a reminder, Fortress is what my iTunes library been lacking for so long now. Completely forgot about it, what the hell. Thanks!
p130
aVIt is so good, start to finish!
p131
aVAlpha - Alpha
p132
aVI have been singing the chorus nonstop ever since it got released. Maybe I should seek help... Or not, it's amazing!
p133
aVYou should maybe just stop bleeding on the inside.
p134
aVAlpha - Four Lights
p135
aVIt's a song!
p136
aVOmega - The Bad Thing
p137
aVThis song was fucking crazy live.  There was so much energy in the crowd.  I really love Spencer's vocals in this song too. 
p138
aVI actually think that song is more balls-to-the-walls than Icarus Lives.
p139
aVMy favorite right now. That breakdown !
p140
aVAlpha - The Scourge
p141
aVI was really disappointed by this song when it was released as the first single, but hearing it in the context of the album has made it one of my favorite tracks.
p142
aVSame here! Realizing the same fact made me real proud of Periphery, no matter how weird that sounds. I thank god my music tastes brought me to this band 3 years ago.
p143
aVI didn't like it at first either, and didn't even want to give it too many chances.\u000a\u000aThen on my first playthrough of the full album the "*Surrrrvive! I will survive! Collapsed ceilings above drop rage upon them...*" section just completely wrecked me. I was floored at not only those fucking ruthless riffs and vocals, but everything prior to it building it up started to make sense as well.
p144
aVThe outro/reprise at the end is one of my favorite parts of the album. The jazzy/electronic progression is awesome and spencer's vocals over it are perfect
p145
aVFavourite song from Alpha probably, and probably in my top 3 from both albums. Such a solid, crushing song.
p146
aVAlpha - Psychosphere 
p147
aVI think I said something like this in another thread, so forgive my repeated comment, but this song felt a little like a TesseracT song.  The guitar/bass in that song seems to slap me in the face the same way the guitars in Altered State do.  This is almost certainly not a helpful description, but it's what I've got.
p148
aVI haven't seen too many people get stoked on this song yet, but I really like it. Especially the part where the "KILL THEM SLOW" chanting comes on with Spencer delivering some sporadic psychotic screaming in the background over top of that insane rhythm, followed by that creepy clean part. Definitely one of the highlights of the album for me.
p149
aVThe end of this song is where the main character recognizes what is eating away at him from the inside and either accepts or loses control.\u000a \u000aThe very exact moment is during the last "Kill them slow!" where there's no echoing voices and only one, resonant exclamation.\u000a\u000aThe demon has taken over.
p150
aV[deleted]
p151
aVOmega - Graveless
p152
aVI didn't really dig this song the first few times I heard it, but was just blown away when they played it at the concert.  One of my favorites now
p153
aVAgreed, it's a very busy song and can cause a bit of sensation overload the first few times.
p154
aVHow was the show? I'm totally psyched to see them next Wednesday in Detroit.
p155
aVFucking catchiest chorus Spencer's done. I get it stuck in my head constantly. 
p156
aVFavorite song on Juggernaut. It's so emotional, from the composition to the lyrics.
p157
aVOmega - Hell Below
p158
aVLol @ the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star reference at the very end.
p159
aVThat's the same melody as the ABC's song, which makes sense in the context of the album seeing as that goes into Omega and Omega is the last character in the Greek alphabet. "Now I know my ABC's..."
p160
aVDude, that's deep. You might be on to something..
p161
aVI didn't think this up on my own though, I just saw it on r/peripheryband and it blew my mind
p162
aVI heard that the first time I listened to this song, and I was all 'No, there' s no way they really did that'. 
p163
aVHaha yes, I was totally in doubt too. Had to back it up and re-listen to make sure I wasn't hearing things!
p164
aVI had a bud who listened to this song by itself when the songs hit YouTube. He said it was horrible, and I told him to listen to the albums from the beginning. I'm hoping he comes back to this song to notice why it sounds like this, and how badass this song actually is. 
p165
aVI wonder how much they'll play this one live, if at all. The low end in that song is about 17 Hz, if Nolly's bass is in C#0 as we expect, and that low frequency may not translate well at every venue. I'd be stored to hear it live, but it'd be really hard to mix live I think. I could be totally wrong though. 
p166
aVThis was my least favorite track when I first heard the album.\u000a\u000a\u000aDefinitely one of my favorites now.
p167
aVAlpha - Heavy Heart
p168
aVTurn the sad song up on the ru-ru-radio. I love it.
p169
aVIt's so corny but the fucking bulb riffs at the end 3.08 make it one of the best on the album. It's got that touch of final fantasy to it
p170
aVUematsu arpeggios for sure. 
p171
aVI keep reading comments on how too over the top this part is, but I'm with you, I love it!  Periphery (much like Coheed whom I love dearly) always seems to have this knack for writing insanely catchy music with enough meat and/or heaviness to withstand obsessive and repeated listening.  I feel this song captures that aspect of the band really well. 
p172
aVYeah I get a strong Coheed connection on this album, which is a good thing as I love Coheed.
p173
aVAfter the Clear EP, I have to admit I was a bit nervous about the direction this band was taking. This has been one of my absolute favorite bands for going on 6 years now, staying in rotation for me even as my tastes have really shifted away from prog and metal. So I was weary heading into this album. But then they started releasing the singles. I enjoyed them all, but the last two they released, Graveless and Alpha, really stuck with me in particular. I was really struck by Periphery's growth in songwriting. I got my hands on the whole album a couple of days ago and have been listening to it on repeat pretty much nonstop. I can happily and safely say it's hands down the best Periphery release to date. From front to back this album is a perfect mix of the beautiful colorful leads, groovy without ever being derivative rhythm guitars, virtuosic drumming from Matt, and Spencer's ever improving vocals. \u000aSome of Spencer's vocal melodies and lyrics struck me as a bit over the top or cheesy on Clear, but here, in the context of this very emotive and well crafted story, every line feels like it has purpose. \u000aI'm on mobile and am getting tired of ranting but I really have so much to say about this album. Incredible release.\u000aFavorite songs so far are: Heavy Heart, The Scourge, Rainbow Gravity, Psychosphere, Priestess, and Omega. I honestly love every song though so the distinction between these tracks and the rest is pretty minute.
p174
aVAlpha - A Black Minute\u000a\u000a
p175
aVI'll give some love.\u000aI love how this song establishes all of the themes necessary to make the album a cohesive experience. By itself, it may not be the strongest song, but it gives the rest of the album a foundation. \u000a10/10, would prog again.
p176
aVi see this song doesn't get enough praise. Same as The Scourge  this song does an excellent job at building up the tension within. 
p177
aVAlpha - The Event
p178
aVThis song is so cool to me and I don't think it gets enough credit, the chord progression is so unique and it grooves so nice. Much yes
p179
aVIt's a great setup for The Scourge. It flows from the previous track to The Scourge so seamlessly. Great transitional interlude.
p180
aVOmega - Reprise
p181
aVLoved a youtube comment on this: "Is this an alternate version of a Black Minute?"\u000a\u000aSomeone's response: "Ah, you must be new to prog."
p182
aVFucking lol'd.
p183
aVOr new to the word "reprise"
p184
aVGood shit!
p185
aVAnyone have an alpha stream for Canadians?? 
p186
aVI recommend downloading the Hola extension for either Chrome or Firefox. \u000a\u000ahttp://hola.org/
p187
aVSo, any ideas about the story?
p188
aV/u/shadow1psc has his interpretation [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Periphery/comments/2u8tlh/my_interpretation_of_alphaomega/)
p189
aVI don't know if it's been said, but I read once that Misha would work the "[lick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDxhnaKD7Q)" into Juggernaut, the same lick around the 0:30 mark in Another Year off of Joy of Motion and countless other pieces of music. That was one of the things I was really excited to hear. And lo-and-behold, it's in the solo for Graveless around the 2:33 mark.\u000a\u000aI love you, Misha.\u000a\u000aEdit: Added a link.
p190
aVlol it totally is. "the lick" \u000alove it\u000a
p191
aVWaiting until I can stream it on Spotify, but can someone please tell me if the riff/lick around 4:12 in this video: http://youtu.be/Y1X6likPKS8 is on the album? I have a vague memory of Jake saying it'd be on Juggernaut when I asked on some social ask-thing.
p192
aVI don't believe it is.
p193
aVThat sucks, I love that lick. \u000a\u000aJust out of curiosity, is your username a Slapshot reference?
p194
aVJust out of curiosity, is your username in Swedish? 
p195
aVYup.
p196
aVVad betyder sjusovaren ens? Är det att man sover lång eller kort tid? 
p197
aVAtt man sover länge. Valde det på måfå, googlade för något år sen och tydligen är utrycket ursprungligen bibliskt, vilket jag inte hade en aning om.
p198
aVILJM. Tackar, ovanligt intressant faktiskt. 
p199
aVI haven't seen this discussed anywhere, but does anyone else notice that the beginning of the Alpha album has the ending of the Omega album playing backwards?
p200
aVI tested this with an audio program and reversed the beginning of A Black Minute, sure enough those first 25 seconds are the same as the end of Stranger Things
p201
aVNot sure if it's backwards, but it's definitely the same electronics.
p202
aVYeah, I spotted that. It makes a nice transition when you're just looping the albums over and over and over ;)
p203
aV[Here's my interpretation of the story from /r/Periphery](http://www.reddit.com/r/Periphery/comments/2u8tlh/my_interpretation_of_alphaomega/)
p204
aVReally enjoy this one.\u000a\u000a\u000aLike the direction they are taking.  \u000a\u000a
p205
aVSo now that I have both the Alpha and Omega CDs in my hand (the actual physical CDs), I have to say that it was worth getting the physical media. The art is nice (nothing new, as most of it was seen on the Youtube videos). As always, I do dig the album cover stickers. Even the CD case sleeves feel nice.\u000a\u000aHaven't watch the DVD that comes with Omega, so I can't comment on that.\u000a\u000aAnd obviously, the music is great (but then I've been listening to the leaks for a while now, so nothing is surprising).
p206
aVA Black Minute/Stranger Things\u000a\u000aThe little chimes/bells subtly in the background at the end of Stranger Things (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYy6_3bem_g#t=7m10s) is played backwards at the very beginning of A Black Minute
p207
aVI didn't think the songs relased before the album were so awesome. I know, they were great but sort of "Meh".\u000aWhen i did listen to the entire album i loved them. For me just a song don't make sense. \u000aAnyone also did feel that?
p208
aVI agree actually, out of context they didn't feel great but I had a feeling in the whole album they would...and I was right! It's the same reason I don't like "Greatest Hits" albums...they lose the "feel" that album contained. Periphery know how to mold an atmosphere on their records and it's important to their sound.
p209
aVHas anybody else noticed how this album's production blows their recent album's productions away? I listened to Juggernaut then P2 after and a year ago P2 was so well produced in my opinion and now it's like wow this isn't as good as I thought
p210
aVI still think their first album was the best sounding. Something about those guitars just sounds so...massive. Their tone has grown sort of tame over time.
p211
aVNah i can definitely agree with that. I remember the first time I heard their first album I was just like WHATTTTT everyhthing sounds SO good.
p212
aVI must say, I am a little saddened not to hear any of the old demos that were said to be intended for Juggernaut. "Fuf" is still my favorite bulb song, and I was really hoping to hear it again!!
p213
aVWell, the main riff of "Rainbow Gravity" [was written as early as 2008](http://www.soundclick.com/bands/page_songInfo.cfm?bandID=147108&amp;songID=7015334)
p214
aVI was kinda hoping for Absolomb
p215
aVJust curious, is there a CONFIRMED story for these albums? I really want to know what each song is about in relation to the story. Is there any info on that? I can't find anything. 
p216
aVnothing official. only fan's interpretations at the moment
p217
aVLyric booklets are with the CD's, so hopefully we can get a more definitive look soon!
p218
aVthey've said at interviews they don't want to give it away to see if the albums tell the story along with lyrics and artwork, to see if the storytelling was clear, they said after a while they would come out with their explanation for exactly what happens in the story.
p219
aVSick! Thanks for the info man.
p220
aVA working stream please? :(
p221
aVSurely I wasn't the only person to notice that MK Ultra is a rerecording of the Bulb demo "Mr.Person"\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HhSLJ431a4\u000a\u000aFound it odd that I was singing along to the groove before I finally realised where it was from. 
p222
aVI loved that The Bad Thing was actually a riff from a video he did about quad tracking guitars. I remember watching that video and being like, "Man! His throwaway tutorial riffs are like a million times better than anything I can do :("\u000a\u000aI felt better about myself when Bad Thing came out...
p223
aVI know how you feel hahaha. 
p224
aVjust got through both albums for the first time and it exceeded all of my expectations of it. I didn't pay too much attention to the lyrical content of it, so i'm still unsure of the concept of it rather than the whole opposites thing, but musically i| can say that this is periphery's best release to date. Just my two cents
p225
aVThis album is great, I love it. It took me a couple listens to really appreciate but its been playing daily since. Periphery really knows how to make an "atmosphere" on their albums.
p226
aVHey everrryone, as a bug Periphery fan, i'm working on an illustrated story based on Periphery's Juggernaut :°) \u000aIt will be great if you would like to see some of my works here ---&gt;\u000a\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/JuggerNovel\u000a\u000a\u000a-JN
p227
aVHas anyone received a copy from Merch Connection yet (US)? Ive been stuck at Order Processed for a week now. One of the shipping apps I used said it shipped already. I'm beginning to feel like something happened. 
p228
aVSpencer is still shit IMO but this music is incredible. I'd pay twice as much for an instrumental version of this whole masterpiece.
p229
aV[deleted]
p230
aV[deleted]
p231
aVNothing wrong with an opinion, but don't come here to trash talk. The great thing about music is that there's enough out there to love. 
p232
aV[deleted]
p233
aVOh, I wasn't saying you were trashing. I just didn't want that coming to yet another thread. I mean, I personally think they don't get enough attention. Haha. 
p234
aVIf you're going to share your opinion, please back it up. Why do they get "more attention than they should"?
p235
aVBecause he doesn't like them.
p236
aVWell that's nice. I didn't like Periphery either until I heard Juggernaut. Music is about enjoyment, no need for unwarranted negativity. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but they need to be backed up by some form of evidence or example.
p237
aVI agree.
p238
aVThey deserve it. Moreso
p239
asVWith all this praise for the new Periphery, it seems a lot of people have forgot how much better they used to be...so here's Letter Experiment.
p240
(lp241
VWhy do you have to make the post so negative? I love Periphery I, and I also love Periphery II and Juggernaut. It's laughable to  me that a fan base is actually so divided over this. If you prefer old Periphery then fine, that's your opinion that you're completely entitled to. But when people start doing this shit, arguing that "new Periphery sucks", and "bulb should go back to writing all the material"... well it makes the whole fan base look like a bunch of elitist hipsters. 
p242
aVI realize (and already commented on) the fact that I should have stated something more along the lines of "how good" instead of "how much better". This post did come across much more negative than I originally intended, but I stand by it.\u000a\u000aI also already commented on the fact that in no way am I saying "new Periphery sucks", and I don't know where you're quoting me on that from anyway, so stop putting words in my mouth. I also stated that I love Juggernaut. Im not angry that people love this album and are giving it praise, Im just concerned at how quick everyone is to say "Yup this is the best so far!".
p243
aVPeople are talking about periphery here a lot because they just released two records, not because they forgot their old stuff.  Not a fan myself, but everyone is well aware of periphery's previous albums.  Also, it's simply your opinion that they used to be better, some people think otherwise.  Better to just post the song. 
p244
aVMaybe I should have said "how good" instead of "how much better"
p245
aVDon't stick your finger in the hornets nest
p246
aVI stuck way more in than just my finger.
p247
aVOddly enough, since Juggernaut came out I've tried to go back to their first album, and it mostly just makes me want to listen to Rainbow Gravity. Something about that opening riff just reminds me of some old P1 tunes.\u000a\u000aI still love Jetpacks, Buttersnips and Totla Mad, though. It's just kind of a dense album and not as varied as the later ones.
p248
aVHaha, actually our opinions are almost complete opposites here. I can't listen to that beginning riff of Rainbow Gravity without craving Icarus Lives!
p249
aVMaybe Im just a bigger fan of Bulb than I am of Periphery. Their first album was like 90-99% Misha's work and it was beautiful. As soon as the other members began collaborating I began losing interest. They just became so tame. \u000a\u000aI still agree Juggernaut is an amazing album on its own, I just can't understand how everyone is able to jump on the "Jugg is their magnum opus" bandwagon. If you held up both albums and told me to pick which one was a better representation of the bands talent, there wouldn't even be any contest. If you tried telling me Juggernaut was a better album, my response would be "You're confused."\u000a\u000aI know I'll get hate for it, but it's my opinion.
p250
aVHaha, I mean it's all opinions. Some people just like the added elements that newer members brought, and some people can't get enough of Misha's writing. Neither one's right or wrong, and I doubt people suddenly dislike P1 just because they might prefer Juggernaut; it's just the newer shinier album and it's getting talked about. I'm sure general perception will change as Juggernaut exits the honeymoon phase or grows on people. \u000a\u000aBut hopefully no one gets blasted for going against either circlejerk. I think it speaks well of the band that they've already got such a diverse discography that they've got people divided into camps based on only 5 years of existence as a group.
p251
aVSee, I do enjoy the styles of the other members as well, Clear was an awesome EP to be able to hear everyones styles. Nolly blew me away with Extraneous, Mark's Pale Aura was the shit. I love Matt's style and work too. \u000a\u000aPeople seem to be twisting and misinterpreting my words and assuming this is just me bashing Periphery's new stuff. Its not, thats not at all what Im getting at. Multiple times I've said that I still love them and their music, no matter what it is.\u000a\u000aMy opinion that people seem to be missing is that I was let down with the direction they took. Their first album was so good, and I was really hoping their second album would be along the same lines and in the same style, which is where I was very let down. I still appreciated P2 for what it was, but I couldn't, and still can't, keep from wondering what could have been if they hadn't gone down this new road.\u000a\u000aLong story short: I love Periphery, I always will, I just hear the new stuff and can't help but wonder what they could have been.
p252
aVSorry, I didn't mean to imply you didn't like the different writing styles!\u000a\u000aI just meant there are infinite facets to their music and limitless ways to perceive them, and all views are valid. I figure you know this, I just latched onto the Juggernaut bandwagon thing and wanted it out there in case anyone came in here wanting to downvote people who don't completely love the new stuff, haha. \u000a\u000aBtw Pale Aura is indeed the shit, I love Mark's style and picking out his parts!
p253
aVDon't be sorry! I totally agree with you, and in many ways I love what they've added to the band and what the band has become, I just sometimes wish Periphery could have done its thing (with Bulb as the mastermind) and had the new lineup be something different.\u000a\u000aI don't know, maybe I just need Bulb to release more things, but I really enjoyed Bulb's style with Spencer's harsh vocals on P1. I guess I'm just having all sorts of mixed feelings about the album right now, lol.
p254
aVI remember defending Spencer so hard when this album came out, and he got so much hate online. Then Periphery II came out, and I realized... goddamn, he was actually kinda mediocre on this album. His cleans sound so throaty and forced, and his harshes are pretty monotone. It's kind of a testament to how hard he must've worked in between I and II to make such a huge amount of progress.

aVAt the risk of being killed by that dude, I didn't like it I've been meaning to check these guys out though. Any fans that can point me towards something heavier by them?
p286
aVTheir EP titled Smoke Bomb is a little heavier.  Most of the Silent Machine album is heavier than Ain't That A Bitch, in particular Coming For You.

aVThanks

aVTheir first ep New Dawn is my favorite of theirs, check that out.

aVI need another album by this band. And more music videos. And to see them live. And Stevic to be my cool uncle.\u000a\u000aBut seriously, I've listened to all of Silent Machine almost every day since I bought it mid last year, and it's probably one of my all time favourite albums, I can't wait for more.

VHaken, for sure. Chon tours the US fairly often. Haken does not come here often at all. 
p297
aVHaken. Seen them once live and it was amazing.  \u000a  \u000aOh maybe because I haven't listened to Chon yet, so I *might* have a biased opinion.
p298
aVI would go to both concerts since I would regret not seeing the other band if I chose to see one band only. 
p299
aVI would love to do this but problem is they are playing at nearly the same time on the same day. I would have to try and sneak into the other show where I can be kicked out promptly and see neither band and leave sad
p300
aVWhy can you not buy two tickets and go to both shows? I've never listened to Haken but Chon is one of my favorite bands- I'd go see Haken just because they may not be back for a while / until the next album cycle. 
p301
aVDefinitely Haken.  Chon not only tours often, but they're about to drop a new album anyway.  Once that happens, you can expect to see them everywhere.  
p302
aVI think the show he's seeing would be for Chon's new album.
p303
asVDifference between the terms "experimental" and "progressive"?
p304
(lp305
VExperimental consists in throwing the rule book out the window whereas prog is sticking to the parts of the rule book most rock/metal bands tend to never even scratch. Really, Experimental is very meticulous about how they craft the song to get to that idea they have in mind and nothing is off limits, even the song itself is secondary (meaning, they care little if it is comprehensible to others), whereas Prog is more about meticulously crafting the song, with the idea of it only slightly influencing the final product and the final product needing to be something the fans would expect/what will sell. \u000a\u000a Rarely are either actually progressive (in the strong sense of the word, as in, it's definition). However, more progress tends to come from Experimental groups than in Progressive groups. \u000a
p306
aVI think prog metal tends toward elegance and epicness, incorporating other styles and ideas into something that is generally well polished, refined and ambitious. Dream Theater, Opeth, Porcupine Tree, Mastodon are good examples. The reddit alien drawing at the top of the subreddit is a good caricature of this style.\u000a\u000aExperimental metal also incorporates other styles and ideas but they are often less congruent and more chaotic/random (Unexpect, Dog Fashion Disco, Diablo Swing Orchestra, geez these names really say it all), or it can sometimes actually strip metal down to a more basic form that tends to have a narrower appeal (Meshuggah, Lightning Bolt).
p307
aVI'd say that progressive generally has a more progressive character to it. The use of chord progressions in a rather more progressive way in order to progress a song is a common feature in progressive music.\u000a\u000aExperimental music has more... experiments. The bands experiment with certain experimental ideas in order to experiment on their sound and produce experimental music.\u000a\u000aJoking aside, they're just random words when used without a context. For instance, progressive trance and progressive house are not "progressive" in the same way that prog. rock or prog. metal are. Experimental music, well, you could say that noise music is experimental, but then again there's a genre called noise music. You could call free jazz experimental, but there's a whole lot of free jazz, some of it waaaay wackier than other free jazz. In terms of metal and rock progressive usually means the song's structure, harmony, rhythm are arbitrarily more "complex" than a "non-progressive rock/metal" song. Experimental stuff can push these features even further (Unexpect, for example) or taking an "anything goes" approach (Mr. Bungle might be a good example).\u000a\u000aThere's also 20th century classical music and if you're into experimental and weird sounding stuff, it's the biggest jackpot ever and it'll probably make you question quite a bit just how "experimental" modern bands are. Then again, you could compare common practice period music (baroque, classical, romantic) and prog. rock/metal, and while it's a totally unfair and (largely) unnecessary comparison, in purely technical terms prog. bands are vastly more simplistic. I'm just trying to say that the ideas of music being complex, progressive, experimental, etc. are all extremely relative when you start using them as something other than specific genre names.
p308
aVI would say that "progressive" is trying to improve while still having a general sound. "Experimental" would be branching out to completely different sounds and concepts.
p309
aVI would say that 'progressive' is trying to push pre-existing boundaries, whereas experimental has no such boundaries. Its difficult. maybe experimental music could be considered progressive, but progressive music isn't always experimental kind of deal. Fingers and thumbs. I'm not sure. I can always tell the difference between them by my own definitions, although I can't always define them exactly. \u000a\u000aEdit: words and shit\u000a
p310
aVWhat I think an Experimental song is: \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ95g8uGlkI\u000a\u000aAfter, the album this song is from, is an extreme departure from the three solo albums from Ihsahn, not because the sound is nuts and heavy as fuck ('cause it can be), but because he implemented blow instruments into the songwriting and that is completely out there, when it comes to metal. The fact that every single song on it is excellent, does no harm either. Be it insanity, chaos, despair, regret, elation, excitement... You name it. Ihsahn managed to convey and pass those concepts, wrap them around impeccable execution and blow everything you think doesn't work in metal away.\u000a\u000aAnd a progressive one:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZMTDcqKnQ\u000a\u000aI know it is an entire album but the album is actually just one song. The concept is still the same during all of its duration and both versions, with vocals and instrumentals only, paint a very distinctive story. This is a trip to the depths of the ocean and/or of the human mind. I remember the first time listening I was so taken out of everything that when Benthic started playing, my body was waving together with the main riff, feeling the pressure and the waters passing through me. The band managed to turn their name into song and making sound into water is no easy task.

p314
(lp315
VThe rerecording of Nothing probably have the best guitar sound I've ever heard.
p316
aVI spent too long not realising there was a re-release of the album.\u000a\u000aI will never get those years back.
p317
aVIt's honestly hard for me to listen to the original. Sounds like a demo lol. The rerecording is better in every way 
p318
aVthe rerecording was their first album to utilize 8-string guitars, which improved overall clarity and tone at their low tuning. But I assure you, nothing quite packs a punch like the original Nothing drums. Just listen to the china in rational gaze and tell me I'm wrong.
p319
aVActually Catch 33 had 8 strings one year before the rerecording.
p320
aVIt's most noticeable for me with Spasm.  This album is so cold and inhuman sounding and Spasm is taken to a whole darker level on the rerelease. 
p321
aVMan, that song is the tits
p322
aVFinally someone who linked the remastered one. This song is the fucking shit, so is the whole album. Rational gaze.. hnnnng
p323
aVThis album is great. There is some things I like more about the original but they really improved the general theme when they brought in the quality ibanez's to re-record it.\u000a\u000aComparing the :48 section of stengah is hilarious...oh, and they made nebulous even heavier than before by slowing it way down.
p324
aVThat version of Nebulous is so good.
p325
aVI honestly prefer the original version of this album, the remaster is too muddy/muffled sounding
p326
aVI think the remaster sounds clearer on headphones while the original sounds more raw, and almost a live mix. Apparently the band had to mix the original record while touring so it was very rushed.

aVI won't be able to unhear this when listening to Fossil Genera now.

aVThis was the first thing that came to my mind when I heard the song many years ago. It sounded so familiar.

aVOh nooooooo! Why did I willingly click on that link? Now it's ruined for me too. Or enhanced? Either way I'll only be thinking of that tie wearing gorilla from here on out.

aVReminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YfrNzAW050) lil dance number.  
p341
aVDidnt listen to these guys for a while (now obsessed), used to call Fossil that Donkey Kong metal ripoff song. It's just so blatant.
p342
aVGoddamnit. Everytime someone posts a BTBAM song I always involuntarily have to go through their entire discography and listen to their stuff.\u000a\u000aOh, and great song from an underrated album.
p343
aVUm, around these parts this album isn't underrated. 
p344
aVErm, perhaps underrated wasn't the right word. But for alot of fans, it really gets overshadowed by Colors unfortunately. 
p345
aVIt wasn't until after Parallax I came out that I started to appreciate this album. Nothing was going to be good enough after Colors, but now I can appreciate this album on it's own merits (and it's really fucking good).
p346
aVColors is a work of art but they just keep getting better. I'm excited for their new stuff.
p347
aVYeah I agree I love colors but great misdirect is close to as good in my opinion and Parallax II is even better than colors at some moments
p348
aVI think when all 5 of them are on point, Parallax II is some of their best stuff. But more often than not the album feels really disjointed for me. 
p349
aVThe bass in this song is just out of control.
p350
aVLove this song. Love this album. They played it on their tour with Meshuggah.
p351
aVYeah, I remember they closed with this song.
p352
aVFuck yeah night owls!

aVI bet this album would have been quite a bit more popular if they did a live DVD like they did with Colors. 
p354
aV*WE MUST MOVE OOOONNNNNN!*
p355
aVgrew tired of this song, then saw them play it opening for Meshuggah and holy shit it's so good and way heavier than I remember
p356
aVThe song that introduced and got me hooked on this band. 
p357
aVWe call ourselves the \u201cnight owls\u201d.\u000aWe\u2019ve roamed the Earth for years and kept your world afloat."\u000a\u000aThat part is so sick.
p358
aVI like, "SIT BACK, RELAX, ENJOY THE RIDE" 
p359
aVThis is actually my favorite song off this album. It's so fucking different.
p360
aVProbably my favourite BTBAM song.
p361
aVThis album is very interesting. When I first listened to it, I got a very western/country vibe, because of all the acoustic guitar parts and the almost country sounding electric guitar parts, but it's still metal. It's kind of difficult to describe and I'm really bad at describing it, but I do love this album. 
p362

aVI can't remember what the basis this was going to be off of. Is it new releases/newish albums or just whatever we vote is worthy for the week in general?

aVOk Then\u000a\u000aToo many to choose however!
p412
aVThere are, but we want to have a good mixture of albums that most people know and albums that most people might not have heard of. Which is why we've limited it to one album per band, generally.

p418
aVI was talking to a buddy about this, and we kinda decided that if Meshuggah split their sound, then Vildhjarta took one way and Tesseract took the other
p419
aVThat actually makes a lot of sense.
p420
aVAnyone know what's up with Vildhjarta? I can't find out anything about what they're up to by google searching. Are they releasing a new album this year ?
p421
aVThey posted a drum play-through of Eternal Golden Monk by their new drummer and also said they were working on new "riffethy". Look on their Facebook. I would expect an album this year
p422
aVI completely lost my shit when i first heard 6:28. So damn cool.
p423
aVI'll admit, I never was crazy in to them, but this album has been growing on me lately, mostly due to this song.  They just have a really distinct style that isn't super accessible.
p424
aVHell yeah, I agree. At first I was kind of off put by them, but they definitely grew on me. They have a uniquely obscure sound which I can't get enough of.

aVSo legendary 
p436
aV[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiSr8iNwWsw) is a little video showing what he does.

aVThey're a metalcore band that receives a lot of hate because they're pretty terrible. However, I will say that the song Not the American Average is pretty good when you're drunk. 
p454
aVI find that the first minute or two of their songs are good but the become chugcore
p455
aVYeah, [A Prophecy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-HRWP345Qs) is a good example of that. The first 40 seconds sound like they could be a pretty decent melodeath song, but the entire rest of the song is literally nothing but chugs. Talk about wasted potential.

aVWow. What the fuck. Those are some very misogynic and sexist lyrics. It's really degrading and almost shocking.
p463
aVI don't like to bash people's musical opinions. But can anyone actually listen to the lyrics and think "yeah, that totally wasn't disgusting and gave me no desire to projectile vomit."?
p464
aVI had a friend of a friend who liked them and claimed that NTAA's lyrics were "badass and poetic." This is the same type of person who won't listen to anything much longer than 3-4 minutes because songs longer than that are "boring."

aVHonestly. With *half decent* lyrics the song would be sorta almost okay, but I guess that's expecting too much from the premier sumerian-core-lolol band.
p466
aVWith a title like "Not The American Average" I expected some kind of semi-insightful politically driven song.  Instead I got a song that's pretty much about raping a woman. Not cool guys, not cool...
p467
aVYeah.  The inanity of it pushes it to a level that I find more offensive than  [shotgun sodomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGcsyzWQfgQ)
p468
aVYou sure? I'm pretty sure it's this one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLQBebfEXpc
p469
aVMy bad.  I just looked at the top videos on the Sumerian channel.  Didn't look for anything on other channels.\u000a\u000aI guess this video was produced right around the time they got signed?
p470
aVI've been there too, *sigh*.
p471
aVI liked the first one a lot better :(
p472
aVMoney equals talent! Duh.
p473
aVIt's actually a band that's decently talented and cool to hate on for neckbeards since they're very successful
p474
aVI'll bite. Popularity =/= talent. I would not call Nicki Minaj as talented as many people who are less popular than her. Of course, the reverse is also untrue, just because a band is unpopular doesn't make them good, but I digress.\u000a\u000aOne of the songs posted in this thread feel like they are right in tune with the edginess and angst of the average teenager, a market that is very vocal and outgoing.
p475
aVIt really can't be seriously said that they lack in talent as a group, back in their early days a good amount of their songs had pretty difficult riffs in between the breakdowns and power chord choruses.
p476
aVBeat me to it!\u000a\u000aHe's such a great entertainer.
p477
aV"Worsnop kinda sounds like something a wizard would name his diiiiiiick ..."\u000a\u000aI lost it.
p478
aVFuckin' hilarious. Rody's fantastic.
p479
aVLove the video, and PTH. But this was such a clickbait title. 
p480
aVNot really. Seemed to sum up the video nicely for me.
p481
aVGood. More people hear about P-Test, and more people stop listening to AA
p482
aVthis...this is the greatest audition video of all time... but i'm ashamed that he didn't mention Mr. Clean. \u000a
p483
aVSorry but this just comes off as dickish to me. While I like prog metal better than metalcore in general, the amount of shit that gets poured on metalcore (and specifically AA) by "real" metal fans is kinda ridiculous. Some of AA's stuff is admittedly painful, but some of it actually isn't bad. 
p484
aVNot all of the pouring of shit is to be taken seriously, though. There has always been friction AND lighthearted jabs between metal genres. It's not always necessarily meant to create divides and drama.
p485
aVI totally get that, I just personally think it was kinda uncool of a guy in a band to decide to make a video to make fun of another band just because he doesn't like them. Apparently this is an unpopular opinion!
p486
aVIts a completely valid opinion:)
p487
aVyou are so right man, that's generally why i like the prog community cause most of them seems reasonable and accept all kinds of music genres. I do love rody and PTH I've would probably like this video if he didn't make fun of a specific band.
p488
aVDude, I like metalcore, and "real" metal of all types....but I still can't stand this band.
p489
aVCame here to say this.\u000a\u000aOld avenged sevenfold is great.\u000a\u000aOld trivium is great.\u000a\u000aAugust burns red is great.\u000a\u000aAA is fucking HORRENDOUS.
p490
aVI jam ABR and ETID daily. Fuckin solid bands.
p491
aVAA's newest album isn't half bad tbh. Their vocalist has come a *long* way.
p492
aVThat's fine, and I can see why you do (there is plenty of metalcore out there that I like way more than AA), I just thought that a guy in a band making a video making fun of another band just comes off as mean spirited. Apparently other people here do not agree. 
p493
aVI hear what you're saying, and it's a valid opinion, but it's pretty innocent stuff. My intent certainly wasn't malicious, just a little (in my opinion) harmless fun.\u000a\u000aI certainly did not expect it to garner the attention that it has.
p494
aVI hear ya, it wasn't that bad all things considered. Thanks for taking the time to reply.
p495
asVDavid Maxim Micic - Daydreamers
p496
(lp497
VI've discussed how in love I am with Bilo 3.0 before, so I'll try to point out something new this time: How cool will it be for David's niece (the child singing halfway through) to hear this track as she grows up? Out of the ordinary documentation of someone's childhood, that's for sure, but awesome! "Oh, here's me as a kid, singing on a phenomenal progmetal album".
p498
aVI love it when bands/people do that. Like in BTBAM's Parallax 2, the song Autumn (though most people dont like it) was part made by Tommy's - the vocalist- child. 
p499
aVWow, that is cool, I'll check it out asap! I've been working on including a few friends for my own stuff, it's a great excuse to keep in touch with people and create something that is a reminder of them, using their talents to add more to your own work.\u000a\u000aThanks for the heads up about Autumn.
p500
aVOh lol, no, it's just space noises.
p501
aVI love that part and how purposefully placed it is. I love how flawlessly Bilo 3.0 as an album conveys the tumultuous but exciting process that is growing up, and this closing track is the perfect retrospective. A reminder to keep a sense of innocence and wonder and to not take anything for granted. I love this album so much. 
p502
aVYeah, it's amazing the progression from the three eps. They're all wonderful, but the difference between 1.0 and 3.0 is crazy. The organic quality of 3.0, like you said there's all this sense of wonder about it, and a ton of bittersweet nostalgic feelings. It's odd, with how retrospective 3.0 is, it sounds like it could be the closing of the saga, but there's to be one more. I have no idea what 4.0 and his new ECO/EGO thing will sound like, but I can be reasonably certain I'll enjoy it immensely.
p503
aVThat acoustic part near the end is fucking amazing!\u000a\u000aDavid Maxim Micic is my religion 
p504
aVI love that part it's one of my favorite parts in the album along with the scat solo in "Where Is Now".
p505
aVYes! Also the guitar solo in that song is awesome 
p506
aVEven though i heard this a few months ago, this album, and pretty much all of David's work 'clicked' for me this week. And in all honesty Bilo 3.0 is one of my favourite albums ever. It seriously is just as good as Portal of I - which has been my favourite album for 2 years now.\u000a\u000aThis song especially feels like his best piece, his magnum opus.\u000aAbsolutely amazing stuff.
p507
aVFull album streams aren't allowed to be posted. If you'd like to post this song, [here is a YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd_O5TOWO_s) and [here is the Bandcamp link](http://davidmaximmicic.bandcamp.com/track/daydreamers).
p508
aVIn his defense, he did link to the time of the specific song (Daydreamers), not his fault DMM didn't upload each song separately. The youtube link you posted isn't from David's channel, seems kinda bullshitty for 'Arnav Barua' to benefit any more from music that isn't his. Better the views go to David.
p509
aVSure, that's why I also suggested the Bandcamp link, where you can directly purchase the music. As it stands, he still submitted a link to a full album stream, which is against the rules of the subreddit. I'm not trying to be a jerk, just trying to help keep the place clean from posts which break the subreddit's rules.
p510
aVSee, I agree with you that according to the letter of the law, he submitted a link which technically contained a full album stream. However, his post was titled about a specific song, and the link went to that specific song, so it seems that taking the *spirit* of the law logically, he submitted a 1 song link, that happens to contain the rest of the album surrounding it. He didn't title his link "DMM - Bilo 3.0 (check out daydreamer, it's my favorite!)" submitting the album for consideration as a whole, he focused in on the specificity of the content desired for listening. Just like if you submitted a single song that happened to be part of a youtube playlist of an album, it'd still be okay.\u000a\u000aI'm not disagreeing with you, and it's certainly a matter of semantics regarding the interpretation of the rule, I'd be curious if a mod could clarify for future reference.

asVDerek Sherinian - Black Utopia
p539
(lp540
VI love most of Derek Sherinian's solo albums, but Black Utopia in particular might be my favorite.  Molecular Heinosity is also killer.  Zakk Wylde goes fucking ham on the pinch harmonics in [Wings of Insanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhlfTBiAWo) from that album. Although [Antarctica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yOAJYvEFtE) is my favorite song from Molecular Heinosity, maybe because it sounds like it could easily be a Planet X song.

aVYep. Just some generic radio rock. Fun stuff.
p554
aVProbably not prog in the slightest, but people seem to dig this band whenever they get posted here. They were super good live though; put on a show that rivaled Periphery.
p555
aVNot prog. Certainly has a sound that was inspired by it (Djent in particular), but not prog in the slightest. More alt metal than anything.
p556
aVSome of their stuff has a  proggy kind of tool vibe, I'd say they're a little bit prog. 
p557
aVI would agree. Some of their composition and stylistic choices are quite proggy. Getting a decent FTM vibe from them.

aVLove the new cymbals too.  He talks about the improv in the youtube description:\u000a\u000a&gt; None of the drumming is really that complicated, and a lot of the drum parts are up for interpretation. There is a lot of room for improvising and just going with the feel, which is something I really appreciate! I feel like a lot of the other music I perform and write is heavily grid locked, and parts are to be translated exactly as they are recorded... This song I feel like is the exact opposite when it comes to playability and feel.

VI love Mangini but this guy should be behind the DT throne.
p594
aVI remember really pulling for him during the audition process, because Angra is the band that got me into prog. I still think Marco should have gotten it though.
p595
aVAquiles was my pick going into it as well, for similar reasons; and I do believe that he would have been a fantastic musical addition to the band. But when watching through the series, it was clear that he wasn't going to work out. The language/cultural barrier alone was just too much for a band that relies so heavily on interpersonal chemistry!\u000a\u000aThat said, I also came out rooting for Marco, and I feel he would have lifted the band to new and unexplored heights. Mangini has the talent, but Marco has the flair (and talent) that I really would have loved to see!
p596
aVI liked Mangini during the tryouts.  I like his decorated history in percussion.  I hate the over engineering of his parts on the new DT albums.  Sounds like I'm listening to Death Magnetic by Metallica.  
p597
aVI wholeheartedly agree with both sentiments. He was great in the tryouts, and I was looking forward to seeing what he would bring, but the production mishaps have really been dampening my enthusiasm...oh well, maybe next album they'll get it right :/

p609
(lp610
VI loved this album.
p611
aVAgreed.  It's less experimental but more focused and polished than Heritage.  The lack of focus is what hurt the replayability of Heritage even though I really like it, but Pale Communion's still on regular rotation for me.
p612
aVI'm still re-visiting it, which means it stood the test of time (for me) :p
p613
aVIt took me a while to embrace the new Opeth, but I will always be a full supporter of their music. Mikael is an absolute genius when it comes to music.
p614
aVYou know, I still haven't listened to this album and there is no reason why. I love Opeth! I love their slower, less growly stuff. I really should listen to it. 
p615
aVThis song isn't slow lol
p616
aVRight, but I know the album generally is by comparison to other albums based on reviews and such. 
p617
aVMaaaan I love the solo in this song. Frederick is the bomb diggity. Like halfway through he does this pentatonic thing but it sounds so dark, but still retains its bluesyness. 
p618
aVThe solo is so great. It reminds me of something that like Randy Rhoads or someone would play. It's so tasteful, but also so technical. Love it.
p619
aVI don't like this new Opeth. I thought this album (and *Heritage* too) was just bland and uninspired. It's not the lack of metal, as I really liked *Damnation* and my taste in music is quite extensive. It's a shame, they used to be one of my favorite bands many years ago.
p620
aVI agree with you that Heritage for the most part was pretty bland, but I think Pale Communion, while not heavy, was a significant improvement over Heritage. I think Opeth fully adapted to their new style with Pale Communion, while Heritage was sort of a trial run in many ways. This album also has a number of great songs, like Cusp of Eternity, Eternal Rains Will Come, and Faith in Others, while in my opinion, Folklore was the only decent song from Heritage.
p621
aVThe way I see it, Pale Communion is a step in the right direction from Heritage. I enjoyed it, while not as much as Opeth's older stuff, it was still a good album. Leagues better than Heritage. 
p622
aVI think everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I think this is an opinion that's been parroted by a lot of the community since Heritage was released.
p623
aVI'm kinda new here so I wouldn't know, and I've read reviews both praising and criticizing this album... but if a lot of people are saying this, maybe there is something to it?\u000a\u000aBut yeah, to each their own.
p624
aVI agree 100%. I like this album, but it's not anywhere near Damnation. Watershed was where you could tell Opeth were beginning to run out of fresh ideas.
p625
aVYeah. The last Opeth album I really liked was *Ghost Reveries* tbh, but even that album was kinda "weird" for me. The use of keyboards, the lack of Steven Wilson's production... it definitely had some pretty fucking great moments, but really felt like a different Opeth.
p626
aVThey played this song live when I saw them. The accompanying lights were awesome 
p627
aVLove the new album. I'm into Opeth's clean stuff (Damnation, Heritage, and individual songs like Harvest and Face of Melinda.). My favorite from this has got to be [Goblin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHkb8u0NedQ). It's just so interesting. I only wish it was longer. 
p628
aVIf you like that, you might check out the Italian progressive rock band of the same name, to whom this song is a very obvious tribute.
p629
aVI'll have to do that. Thanks for the tip! 
p630
aVI'm a big opeth fan, but I never really got into this album. Rvery so often I would listen to a track here or there hoping it would click for me, cause y'know, it's opeth, but it never clicked. Till now, this showed up on my feed and I really dug it, listening to the whole album now. Thanks OP

asVEmergence - Silver Lights (FFO: Wide Eyes+Vocals, Kadinja, Astraeus)
p639
(lp640
VSo the two guitar players from Wide Eyes, with their ridiculously frequent output, have this other project, Emergence, that is pretty much the more aggressive side of Wide Eyes plus some pretty crazy vocals. The growls aren't my bag of chips, but I can't deny they're quite explosive, and the cleans are intense. Remember I'd found a demo of this song on youtube a bit ago, didn't realize the album had come out!\u000a\u000aSpecifically about this song, the vocals right at :40 or so to finish that section are amazing, and my two favorite guitar grooves are both a little later in the song, 1:50 and near the end at 3:15, particularly remind me of Kadinja.\u000a\u000aCheck out the [rest of the album here](https://emergencemusicproject.bandcamp.com/album/emergence).

aVI became obsessed with Lateralus during my junior year of high school, and a decade later it's still my favorite album. \u000a\u000aI've listened to plenty of amazing music since then, but I don't think anything will ever quite surpass the effect that album had on me when I first discovered it. \u000a\u000a(Some albums that have come close: Karnivool's Sound Awake, TesseracT's One, Telefon Tel Aviv's Immolate Yourself, the first Periphery album).
p661
aVSame thing with me.  Came out when I was 13.  Heard Schism on the radio while staring at the stars in the middle of the night out in the country at 1 in the morning.  That was back when they weren't clipping long songs for airtime.  It was a very spiritual experience.  Told my Mom I wanted the CD for my birthday, and being as she liked rock too, I was able to listen to it as much as I wanted in the house.\u000a\u000aLater, bought the rest of their CDs with birthday/Christmas money within the next 3 years.  Made me really introspective at an important time in my life, and it was a blessing, really.  I started discovering my own spirituality, became infatuated with art and music, and started learning how to play guitar.  Am now 26, and spend a large amount my time playing and writing music(on my own, not in any bands).  I had a fairly shitty childhood, and went to a pretty racist school(I'm white, but grew up in the "ghetto" if you will).  So, after dealing with stupid shit all day, I was able to go home and lose myself to music and art.  I give Tool the majority of the credit for my love of art.
p662
aVFunny thing is that I've devoted a huge part of the last decade to music (generally writing and recording on my own) and writing fiction. Tool was definitely a catalyst for my appreciation of music.\u000a\u000aOddly enough, Schism never quite grabbed me when I first heard it on the radio.
p663
aVI'm telling you man, it's that breakdown part half way where everyone stops and Adam plays alone(that A note section), and Justin slowly joins back.  As a kid, I was obsessed with astronomy and the stars, and I was lucky enough to camp at someone's property in the country that night.  That song was just perfect.\u000a\u000aThings that give you goosebumps and make you submit in awe.

p668
aVBands have risen and fallen in the time it has taken to make this album. I wouldn't have it any other way.
p669
aVThey are recording it right now
p670
aVI heard they were supposed to release it last year. I've just given up hope that a new album will ever come out. 
p671
aVPlease go and read up on U-G, or check out Tool Archive's youtube page.  The band and their legal team has been dealing with a lawsuit for a long time now that keeps derailing the album's production, and some of the guys have had personal things going on too that have come up.

p687
(lp688
VSeems like Dan can hold his own, which doesn't surprise me!
p689
aVawesome, Dan hit the high notes at the end of Nocturne.
p690
aVThis is kind of like fan fiction, with much less sex and a lot more awesomeness.
p691
aVMore like performance spotlight of Dan.  Y'all can't even play like that ending of Nocturne didn't make the hair on your neck stand straight up.  Fuckin' awesome !  
p692
aVHe sounds much more strained when hitting the notes, than originally on the album, where they come across as much more effortless.  It still sounds good, but I prefer the other vocalist.
p693
aVAshe (the other vocalist) didnt even attempt to hit his high notes live. It's a lot easier in the studio to make a hundred attempts for a single high passage.
p694
aVYeah.. Ashe was good, but his live performance was a loooot of backing tracks. Dan uses next to none and manages to just about hit all of the notes. 
p695
aVInteresting.  I've only listened to the album and watched some studio videos.  Hopefully the next album hits me like Altered State did.  The albums before it didn't really resonate, but AS has a lot.
p696
aVIs it because there's no screaming in AS -__-
p697
aVNot at all. I primarily listen to metalcore., which has plenty of screaming. I've been getting more into prog metal as of late with bands like TesseracT and Sky Harbor.

p709
aVHoly progressive! o.O This is jaw dropping. I am absolutely floored. This release is going to be massive and stunning. Like, possible AOTY material right here. 
p710
aVIm so glad he included some harsh vocals in this song. I always wondered what Disperse would sound like with different vocals and I'm glad this will be a close representation. 
p711
aVGreat song! More a fan of this than Disperse.\u000a\u000aI also love that little riff with the guitar "glitch" of sorts.

aVFor me it would pretty much be if Brandon Baker (ex-Veil of Maya vocalist) joined After the Burial, or if Tosin Abasi had made being part of Born of Osiris a permanent thing. That's actually how I first heard of him, right around the time the first AaL album came out he was a touring guitarist with Born of Osiris and I was like "Damn I didn't think they had a black guitarist, who is that guy?" \u000a\u000aI'm a little leery of just throwing a bunch of random guys from different bands together because the whole is not always equal to the sum of parts, know what I mean? Seems hard to predict who would actually play and write well together and who would just add up to a wank-fest.

aVAdler plays for the song. I like that. They've both got amazing chops, no doubt about it. But Adler is a lot better than you think. Have you heard his work on Protest The Hero's new album?

VThe band sounds fucking great, seems like Justin and Mikee might have had a hard time keeping up at the start.
p832
aVI was there! Sikth are fucking tight man. Loved their set. Played pussyfoot on crowd demand. Best gig ever!
p833
aVThey were always going to play Pussyfoot though. They played it all 4 times I saw them last year, aha. Did they play Peep Show btw?
p834
aVYup!
p835
aVThey were running short on time since we have to end gigs at 10 here but they still played pussyfoot. And yea they played peep show.
p836
aVHearing that they played pussy foot makes me happy. What makes me even happier is that it's 2015 and they are touring! Will there be a new album does anyone know?

aVThe Arusha Accord\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_v5ycse_1Y
p840
aVThank you. Checking the album echoes out now!
p841
aVI've recently got into Aliases, which has Pin from Sikth on guitar.  Took me a few listens to really get into it but they are great.  Same technical high energy vibe.  \u000a\u000a
p842
aVYea the safer than reality EP was good, but you are right, it did take a few listens. Exasperated though is fantastic, has me expecting a lot from the new album (whenever that may be released) 
p843
aVDefinitely Fellsilent if you haven't listened to them yet. I recommend Immerse to start.
p844
aVyes! great band, shame they split, but then again its hard to be upset when that split resulted in tesseract and monuments!\u000a\u000aThe hidden words is now back in rotation.. thanks!
p845
aVYea it is quite a shame :/ I was really impressed by the bands that spawned out of them, although I enjoy Fellsilent the most out of them all so I do wish they had stuck together to be perfectly honest. Would have been interesting to see where they went from this album.
p846
asVOpeth - Beneath the Mire
p847
(lp848
VI'm not sure if Ghost Reveries is the "best" Opeth album, but it's definitely my favorite.
p849
aVYep, this and Damnation are my favorites :)
p850
aVSame. It's quite a masterful experience. And that applies to bot GR and Damnation
p851
aVI'm glad i'm not the only person that feels this way haha. Right now Damnation, Ghost Reveries and Pale Communion have the most plays from me, in that order.
p852
aVNope it's their best, GR was easily their peak, went downhill Watershed on wards. 
p853
aVI hated Watershed when it first came out but have been giving it another chance lately. I now register it as 'not bad'. I don't know if my tastes changed or it just makes sense in context (understanding that they were going into Heritage sound next) but there's some good stuff on that record
p854
aVThe riff in Hessian Peel is one of the greatest Opeth riffs ever. \u000a\u000aYou know the one. 
p855
aVThe first 3 songs on watershed are really good imo
p856
aVI would say 90%~ of fans cite Blackwater Park as the peak. I very rarely here GR as being cited as such. And do you think they went downhill after Watershed because of the prog direction they took and there not being much death metal? Because that's a poor way to judge the band, imo. 
p857
aVWhilst I love Blackwater Park, Ghost Reveries for me will always be the best album they made. BWP comes 2nd for me, but only slightly. Perhaps I favour GR because Ghost of Perdition is my favourite song from Opeth all together. \u000a\u000aI feel they went downhill with Watershed itself actually. Without turning this into a whine about genres, Watershed for me was just a poorly made album, it has good *parts* in songs but not good songs themselves. Heir Apparent is one of their heaviest songs, but it's still crap. So I wouldn't call it the change in direction, just the songs are more forgettable. Whilst I tend to skip Atonement, Hours of Wealth and Isolation years on GR because I feel they are just filler for the remainder of the rest of the songs that are 10/10 for me, Watershed just has average songs throughout in my opinion.\u000a\u000aAs for Heritage and Pale Communion, they are just bland and wasteful to me, it's not that they aren't death metal, Damnation is a brilliant non Death metal album, them two though just waste your time with songs that don't go no where, fail to impress or even interest me. I've given both complete listen throughs a good few times, each time I lose interest and just left thinking "That was it?". Needless to say, it's been a steady let down from Opeth for me since around 2008, shame really.
p858
aVI feel like you're missing out on GR as a whole if you skip Atonement, Hours of Wealth and Isolation years. The ending of Hours of Wealth leading into The Grand Conjuration makes both those songs so much more powerful. I'm just as big of a fan of Opeth's soft songs as I am their heavier songs, so this is all just my opinion. But I feel that's what Opeth is all about....or at least was about until their change of direction.
p859
aVI thought it was good, but it doesn't compare to My Arms Your Hearse and Still Life in my opinion, although trying to choose a favorite out of so many amazing albums is still really hard.
p860
aVI also really like Blackwater Park. 
p861
aVDefinitely my favourite and probably my favourite prog metal album of any band.
p862
aVLove this album, Reverie / Harlequin Forest is my favorite song.
p863
aVLove that jazzy soft break in this one. 
p864
aVI feel like I am the only one who considers Watershed as their favorite Opeth album
p865
aVRight with you buddy. I just find myself constantly listening to Watershed the most.\u000a\u000aFor me it's got the right balance of the newer prog stuff, technically cool riffs, really heavy metal, some beautiful melodic singing, folk stuff and a whole lot of just weird and dark sprinkled through it as Mikael was really going through his Scott Walker phase.
p866
aVYes, that's why I love it so much! The balance :)
p867
aVI like Watershed over Ghost Reveries at least. But nothing touches Blackwater Park.
p868
aVBlackwater Park is their best by far. Amazing album. 
p869
aVI would probably put Still Life before BWP, but both are amazing albums. Just comes down to opinions.
p870
aVIts my favorite too, but that may be because it was my first Opeth album
p871
aVDat groovy intro! Ugh so good. \u000a\u000aAlso, I can never get enough of the rhythm and music that accompanies Mikael when he sings the lines, *"wept for solace and submit to faith. In his shadow I am choking, yet flourishing. Master!"* Now THAT is a transition. 
p872
aVI hated this song the first few times I listened to the album. Not sure why, now it's one of my favorite songs of theirs.
p873
aVThe intro, first growl verse and then the clean singing section are all so good. This is one of my favourites from GR, but it doesn't seem to get much attention
p874
aVThis will finally be played live in October. I really wish I could go :/
p875
aVThis was the first song I heard from this album back then and I was blown away!  It's still my favorite on the album. IMO very underrated. Would love to hear it live!
p876
aVI'd flip my shit if I ever was fortunate enough to hear this live. One of those perfect Opeth songs. From the soft midsection onwards this song just fucking slays, musically and lyrically. One of my favorite guitar solos ever as well. Last album with Peter and Lopez, first one with Per as a member. Super random, but I remember dipping out of a homecoming dinner at Olive Garden to go to Circuit City across the street to pick this up. Ahhhh, homecoming, this song, Circuit City, the nostalgia. 
p877
aVI'm glad you guy like this album. 
p878
aVThis was the first Opeth song I've ever. I was blown away when I first heard it. Then I listened to the rest of the album....
p879
aVThis is definitely my favorite album with Still Life behind it. I would then say Damnation comes in at number three. I fucking love Opeth!
p880
asVBands similar to Mr. Bungle?
p881
(lp882
VWhat era of Bungle? Each album is significantly different from the last. I would recommend checking out /r/circusmetal and /r/avantgardemetal for similar stuff.\u000a\u000aFor stuff like the self-titled and California, I recommend Dog Fashion Disco, especially the Adultery album. And their other band, Polkadot Cadaver, especially Purgatory Dance Party. Todd Smith takes a lot of influence from Mike Patton.\u000a\u000aIt'd also be smart to check out other Mike Patton bands. Faith No More, his solo stuff, and Fantomas. Fantomas may be the closest you'll get to Disco Volante. \u000a\u000aTry Diablo Swing Orchestra. Try a band called Organized Chaos (the singer has appeared in two David Maxim Micic songs). Try Tub Ring. Between the Buried and Me takes a lot of influence from Patton, though it's probably not what you want. \u000a\u000aI'll edit this post later as I think of more bands, though I would definitely check the top submissions from those two subreddits at the top.
p883
aVThanks! I like all three of their albums equally\u000a\u000aEDIT: Dog Fashion Disco sounds like just what I was looking for!
p884
aVIt kind of depends on what you like about Bungle and what you get out of them.  If you are just following Mike Patton (which is ok!) for more craziness go with Fantomas.  For more poppy (if it can be called that!) go with Faith No More.\u000a\u000aSomeone like Devin Townsend might work for you.
p885
aVCheck out Cardiacs. 
p886
aVCheck out [Schizoid Lloyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8cyHKs82RM), very eclectic band that is somewhat similar to Mr. Bungle, here's a review by [heavyblogisheavy with a 4.5/5 score](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/01/13/schizoid-lloyd-the-last-note-in-gods-magnum-opus/)
p887
aVYes!!!! This is great, thanks
p888
aVI highly recommend Secret Chiefs 3. It's a band (or group of bands) that Trey Spruance (guitars from Mr. Bungle) leads. Very weird, awesome, experimental stuff.\u000a\u000aYou might also like Giant Squid, uneXpect, Sleepy Time Gorilla Museum, and Buckethead.
p889
aVAs someone else mentioned, Secret Chiefs 3 is amazing. The more I listen to them, the more I actually prefer it to Bungle. I'd recommend the album Book of Horizons to start.\u000a\u000aEstradasphere is another revered genre-hopping band that took a huge influence from Bungle. [Here's a sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c0AFEWjczY) Palace of Mirrors is a good starting point for them, though Buck Fever is their most Bungle-sounding.

p923
aVActually I just found this out yesterday on /r/StevenWilson, but Ninet was actually supposed to sing "Go back if you want to." It's in the first studio update towards the end, but in a Dutch interview that Steven and the band didn't really feel like her vocals were suited for that part.\u000a\u000aHowever, I think that the original version with her vocals will be on the demo version of the song.

aVI love how subjective music is and how personal it cane be, for me the lyrics are amazing. the whole sharing space lyrical content blew me away.

aVThemata takes time, and it's a bit nu-metal, but it's an *incredible* collection of songs

aVConsidering the drums for that album were all written and recorded by Drew, their lead guitarist, that album is amazing.
p996
aVEach of their albums are they're own sound in themselves I find. I've never heard anyone not liking Themata though, every second of that album is pure bliss, it's catchier than ebola.

aVAsymmetry is concept record?\u000a\u000aEdit: I forgot what FTFY is short for..
p998
aVYou know, I never really got into Themata either. I think that's because I listened to Sound Awake first. Sound Awake is concept album, as well, by the way. About a guy trying to escape the church, I believe? Something like that.
p999
aVDuring my first listen through this album, I though they could have stopped at "New Day" and they still would have made the world a much better place. After finishing the album, I don't think I could live without any of the other songs. This one included. So good.
p1000
aVI've been listening to this one a lot lately. The melodic switch from "I needed to know" to "oh no, this can't be happening" halfway through the song might be my favorite moment in any Karnivool song, and the 9/4 groove after that is bliss. I'm so psyched for that North America tour that was rumored.
p1001
aVMy personal favorite is the gradual buildup from when the song goes mostly quiet up until the "AWAY!" line. Such a perfect build up and release of tension; I literally get goosebumps every time I listen to it.
p1002
aVIt's honestly so hard for me to pick a favorite song. Everything they put out is brilliant. 
p1003
aVIllumine gets almost no love (I don't think the band like it, they don't play it live really), but it has such a badass bass-line/groove, I can listen to it all day.

aVI'm trying to get into these guys, after reading the comments, I should do a full run through of this album?
p1007
aVYes! 
p1008
aVAbsolutely. Sound Awake is one of those albums where the songs themselves are great, but the entire album is an experience and fits together so perfectly. It's easily the most well-constructed album I've ever heard. Call me biased but if Fables from a Mayfly didn't exist, this would be my favorite album.

aVFavorite Deftones album. I absolutely love Entombed and Goon Squad. The atmospheres on this album are unparalleled
p1056
aV"The atmospheres... "\u000aPerfectly said. I was bothered some fans thought it was a bit soft. Wonderful album by a growing, evolving band that has written many great songs. \u000aAlmost my exact argument for the new Mastodon cd vs some of the older stuff. Guess some of us like when bands age with their fans!
p1057
aVThis was my first record with Deftones and now it's insanely hard to listen to their older stuff imo haha it's crazy how backwards two fans can be. 
p1058
aVDeftones are one of my favorite bands at the moment. Can't wait for their new album to drop in a couple months IIRC\u000a\u000aEdit: just looked it up. It's rumored that they'll be in the studio by the end of the month. 
p1059
aVHaven't listened to Deftones much since High School (13 years ago), but this is pretty awesome.  My dad always tells me to listen to them--he's a huge fan.

aVIf you liked this you should definitely check out the whole album, highly recommend.
p1061
aVI definitely will.  Added to my Google Play library.
p1062
aVThis album is amazing... including this song. this album has been with me through some hard times.
p1063
aVWhile I think Deftones are pretty great, am I allowed to tip my fedora and say that they're absolutely *not* prog metal?
p1064
aVThey're metal, and pushing on the progressive side with unorthodox writing styles (6 string versus 8, drop a# versus drop e, no knowledge of music theory) used while still being melodic 
p1065
aVAll their songs follow standard song structure (verse-&gt;chorus-&gt;verse-&gt;chorus-&gt;bridge-&gt;conclusion).\u000a\u000aThat's not progressive in a lot of people's books. Just because they use low tunings or odd time signatures doesn't mean they're progressive. Heck, Red Hot Chili Peppers play in drop D - you going to argue they're progressive? Mountains by Biffy Clyro is in 15/8. but it's not a progressive song. Hey Ya by Outkast is in 11/4 - is that prog metal?\u000a\u000a&gt;no knowledge of music theory\u000a\u000aman, now THAT is prog.
p1066
aVI'm not saying that they are special because they play in drop tunings, but because both Chino and Steph play two COMPLETELY different tunings (as in Chino plays drop A# while Steph plays drop E). Also, what I meant by the Deftones having no knowledge of music theory while still being progressive was that they are still able to make well flowing songs without having a set idea of what they are going to come out with. Granted, that's more experimental than progressive, but I still believe that they fall in the same vein. Again, everything I'm arguing for is my opinion. I just believe that the parameters I set for a band to be progressive has been met in my eyes. I won't try to persuade you to have the same opinion as me, I would just like to validate my points.
p1067
aVI agree to an extent but I think Deftones definitely have a lot of prog elements, and their older stuff influenced a lot of bands.

aVI'm quite fond of the live version with the aristocrats 
p1073
aVjust listened. that was easily the best rubber chicken solo I've ever heard
p1074
aVI feel like he would have said 'not meant to sound good' as a way of highlighting it's dissonance rather than meaning it's not supposed to be enjoyable. Guthrie has a rather self deprecating sense of humour so I wouldn't put it past him! \u000a\u000aPersonally love this track. 
p1075
aVthat sounds right, yeah. 
p1076
aVIt is supposed to be off sounding. The two live versions are superior, imo. In the Boing! DVD, Guthrie says they play this song to clear out the venue.

sVPiano solos from Tim of PTH including the interlude from Spoils
p1087
(lp1088
VThis is going to seem like a dick comment, so I'll be complimentary first: I like the composition. The ascending arpeggios are nice, have enough movement and the addition of color tones that are allowed to ring give the chords a great feel beyond just the basic major/minor tonality. He does a good job of voicing to some extent as well, really bringing out the melody notes.\u000a\u000aThat being said, it would be nice to hear a recording with someone who can play evenly, both in terms of getting rid of the rhythmic unevenness, and with some more shaping of the line beyond "melody notes BANG LOUD". On Spoils, it sounds really nice, I'm assuming because of a bunch of quantization of the midi piano, would have been nice to hear it like that, but with a more organic live touch and resonance from the grand they recorded on.
p1089
aVThis is exactly how I felt. Tim definitely can compose some piano pieces, but his dynamic tendencies don't improve the music.
p1090
aVI appreciate the feedback. Definitely the original recording of Isosceles was recorded in midi and after the performance quantized and everything snapped to the grid. With this recording, I wanted it to be a little more real and unedited. Aside from it being hard to edit piano without making it sound edited, I didn't really want to have this edited to sound 100% perfect. This was definitely an example of listening back to something and not being 100% happy with it but I thought it had some character.  \u000a\u000aI would agree with you that my playing could be refined and I probably could have spent a lot more time getting the perfect takes. It definitely is a little sloppy and falls off the grid a touch.  Anyway, on the next batch hopefully I'll have some more time and can put in a better performance.\u000a\u000aThanks for checking it out and for all the nice things you said about the tune.\u000a-- Tim
p1091
aVWow, thanks for stopping by to respond! I completely agree about the difficulty with editing piano, the resonance of the instrument makes it so hard to get a clear enough break in sound to make a cut. I recently finished up recording a piano trio ep and and having to record larger sections to get to stopping points makes it so much more stressful, especially since 'studio' stuff is supposed to be note perfect, makes it hard to focus on musicality when you're so worried about just the technical accuracy. When I was sending in auditions for grad programs and jobs and whatnot, I always would just use live performance videos, since then it'd be okay to have the occasional mistake ;) I'm not consistent enough for studio work, when I record I usually just say 'screw it' and [use the take with the best average playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzre9s1lCMc).\u000a\u000aDo you happen to have a transcription/sheet music to Isosceles? Not that I'm trying to turn this into a dick-measuring contest, I would just genuinely like to see the layout of the arpeggios, like I said I really like the colors it added, figured I might save some time asking before I delved into transcribing anything!\u000a\u000aThank YOU for making such cool music!\u000a

aVThose vocals turned out surprisingly well haha. 
p1147
aVEven the drums don't sound bad! Thought for sure they'd suffer the worse. Seriously had a sweet leaf era sabbath sorta vibe to it.
p1148
aVSounds eerily like a Black Sabbath song. I don't know why but the vocal line, slowed down, is giving me a *really* Ozzie-esque vibe.
p1149
aVspot on. Ozzie was the first thing I thought as soon as I heard this. 
p1150
aVSounds waaaaay more like Black Sabbath
p1151
aVThat was awesome! Is there a subreddit for this kind of thing?
p1152
aVWell this was last week in /r/doommetal
p1153
aVI think I'll see what some of my EPs sound like played at the wrong speed. That was awesome.
p1154
aVThis is fucking incredible. Doom metal is my main love in music and this just made me soil myself with delight.
p1155
aVI'm getting a bit of 'Clutch' from the vocals. I actually really like this.

aVThis sounds really cool. I tend to do this all the time with a lot of songs. Tesseract sounds particularly well slowed down.
p1162
aVGoddamn this jams
p1163
aVReally cool 
p1164
aVThis is totally Black Sabbath, holy shit

aVThis sounded way better than I expected. I was anticipating some horrid drek from the unknown depths of the abyss so maybe that's not the highest praise, but it did exceed my expectations. \u000a\u000aBut can we really call it "Rush"? :-P
p1168
aVNow someone speed up Dopesmoker. 
p1169
aVWhy would you want to do that?
p1170
aVmaybe it'll sound like Rush 
p1171
aVmaaaaaaaaybe, if you speed it up by a factor of 10 :P
p1172
aVSounds more like early Black Sabbath.
p1173
aVIt reminds me mostly of Sabbath. Loved this slowed down version. 
p1174
aVWow, that is not bad at all!
p1175
aVA lot of rush's music played down tuned would be black metal. Its like alex has been planning it for 41 years
p1176
aVThere's one riff somewhere on A Farewell to Kings that seriously sounds like a black metal riff if you play it at 45, haha. I wish I remembered which one it was
p1177
aVLiterally all of tom sawyer is black metal
p1178
aVIs it that last riff in Cygnus X1 book 1? Cause that one was fucking heavy

asVmaudlin of the Well - Secret Song
p1180

VProbably my favourite maudlin song. Though Stones of October's Sobbing and The Blue Ghost are right behind.
p1182
aVExcellent choices. I agree with you.
p1183
asVProg just for being prog?
p1184
(lp1185
VThis isn't the first time I've seen someone differentiate between "prog" and "progressive".  I mean, to me, you can call it whatever you want, but the word prog is really just a shortened version...but the meaning is the same.
p1186
aVIt makes me think of the difference between "metal" and "heavy metal" .  To an outsider it's all just heavy metal, because metal is just the shortened term, right?  But to me at least, heavy metal refers to the older stuff like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, while metal refers to the scene as a whole or post-NWBHM.  A similar concept could be the difference between Rock and Rock n' Roll
p1187
aVNot anymore!
p1188
aVI can respect that, even if I can't wrap my head around some of your choices. Though, I don't split it. If it does something different and interesting while being good at it, it's prog (progressive) to me.
p1189
aVYeah, actually I think that's what I was getting at. Part of what I'm trying to say is it seems "prog" is a genre. The bands in that category all tend to fit in that category, have a similar style. But "progressive" for me is a way to "classify" the unclassifiable, the guys that are so unique or diverse they can't be put in a single genre.
p1190
aVThere's something extremely wrong with throwing Yes and Genesis into a bin of "generic prog formula" bands when they literally helped develop the formula by breaking the mold themselves. \u000a\u000aYou also lump Marillion into that category while Gazpacho gets a pass for being new and inventive? Gazpacho are fantastic songwriters but they owe all of their tricks to the last 30 years of neoprog. \u000a\u000aIt's cool if you want to label bands like this, but let's not pretend it's more than personal taste. Even the rules you listed aren't applied evenly or even to the groups you say they do. Yes valuing technicality over emotion more than Opeth? Have you heard And You And I? Time And A Word? Between The Buried And Me and Devin Townsend fall outside of the group that gets the "nerdy/cheesey sci-fi" label? I just don't get it. 
p1191
aVAll very valid points. This is proving a good exercise for me. I listen to so much music I have to organize it well or I would have an extremely difficult time finding what I want to listen to at any given time. To be honest, you are right about the sci-fi tag. Actually a lot of metal in general falls into that. The more I go through my list the more I think it simply boils down to the damn keyboards. I really hate typical synthesizer keyboard sounds. Many of the bands I listed have that. Another guy mentioned my split also seems to be based on heaviness. That may also be true to some extent. But I still feel there's something else. What could it be? What do you think are the characteristics that split these groups? Or can they even be objectively split? Is it simply the ones I don't like are simply I don't like them for different reasons? 
p1192
aVYou appear to be a metal fan that happens to listen to some prog, rather than a prog fan that listens to metal or a prog metal fan.\u000a\u000aI guess you came from metal first and started listening to prog acts people recommended for you.  It explains why someone suggested heaviness, and also why you hate keyboards (Jordan Rudess has some of the most creative tones, so you probably don't like any keyboards) 
p1193
aVSorry, but Rush? Rush? The single greatest prog rock band of all time? They basically invented hard rocking prog (obviously 21st Century Schizoid Man existed, but everything else is really soft), they have (IMO) the greatest 10+ minute epic ever written (2112), and they succeeded in changing their sound to stay relevant, even moving away from prog for a long time. Plus, they only have one full concept album. 
p1194
aVI agree with you but lets not split hairs.  Yes, Clockwork was their only full concept album but 2112 and Hemispheres were concept album SIDES so most people call those concept albums.\u000a\u000aRush is and always has been my favorite band.  I'm 46 years old and I've been into them since the very early 80s.  I love that their sound changes.  My favorite Neil quote is when he said, "When we realize we're beginning to sound like Rush, we know its time for a change."\u000a
p1195
aVHa, that's definitely true. I'm not saying they didn't have high concept stuff, just that technically their only full concept album is CA. I like that Neil quote a lot, I'd never heard that before.
p1196
aVI just don't like all these generic metalcore bands these days calling themselves progressive just cause they have some off-time rhythms and a bit of ambience.
p1197
aVAgreed, sometimes people get a little to carried away with the "prog/progressive" tag. Dude, I drop my high E string to D. I'm progressive.
p1198
aVDude, my bass player listened to a Safety Fire song once. If we're not progressive now, I don't know what is.
p1199
aVI'm a little confused at your division of genre, it just seems really arbitrary. If it all helps in your head then thats cool of course, but it just seems like you're grouping the 'heavy' prog bands on one side and the 'not so heavy' prog on another. Just boiling down Mastodon (for example) to scales also strikes me as weird. Those fuckers groove in odd times all over the place, and the scales aren't that weird, they just use a lot of those 'blue' notes or just play weird 'out' notes a bunch, particularly on the old stuff. 
p1200
aVIt does kind of look like that doesn't it? However, The Dear Hunter, (newer) Karnivool, Gazpacho, The Tea Party, and (some) Devin Townsend are not hard at all.\u000a\u000aAs for your Mastodon comment, I was trying to characterize each band I listed by the thing that stood out most to me. Mastodon was actually the hardest one for me to describe. Admittedly "scales" was not how I wanted to characterize them but I couldn't think of how to describe their most stand-out characteristic in just a few words. Maybe "melodic dissonance"? Yes, they throw in some "odd" notes into the scale or key they're playing and maybe a few "odd" harmonics that creates a dissonant sound but still keep a melodic groove and sound to everything. No one really quite does that like they do.
p1201
aVI respect your thoughts and opinions but I dunno. I just don't have the same view. Which is fine really. But you did a good job dividing the two terms "prog" and "progressive"
p1202
aVYeah totally Yes uses dissonant scales and uses odd time signatures exclusively, with plenty of off-key vocals.   BTBAM is always melodic with variation in instrumentation.\u000a\u000aAlso Tool wasn't crazily unique.  A metal band that got popular at the turn of the century with a loud guitar production style?  What about SOAD?\u000a\u000aAlso where the heck is King Crimson in that list?  They're probably the most progressive band.
p1203
aVI split them as well but not the same way and not as cleanly (i.e. there is a lot of gray area).\u000a\u000aI think of bands as being progressive bands, or progressive-x (where x is a genre of music).\u000a\u000aIf a band is doing what most people today would call progressive (Dream Theater, 70s Rush, Yes, Spock's Beard, Porcupine Tree) then they fit into the former category. \u000a\u000aHowever, if the band is doing music that is heavily progressive INFLUENCED like Styx, Queensryche, soem Iron Maiden, hell lets even lump Zac Brown Band and Ray Wylie Hubbard in there, then they are "progressive-x".\u000a\u000aI think a lot of bands are progressive influenced in that they stretch away from their traditional genre.  I'm not into country music in the least but Zac Brown live is flippin' amazing - rock, R&amp;B, soul, motown, country, metal - you hear it all.  That is a prime example of a progressive-x band. (progressive-country in this case)
p1204
aV[deleted]
p1205
aVI see what you're saying, but I'm confused by rush's placement. I'm not some big rush fanatic here to defend the ground they walk on, but aren't they one of the bands that spearheaded prog rock, and contributed the most to it back in the day?\u000a\u000aHaving a hand in laying the groundwork I can understand why they would sound formulaic nowadays, but I'm pretty sure they were incredibly unique in their time. \u000a\u000aYour list is from a modern perspective though, so it makes sense if I think about it. 
p1206
aVTo comment on the idea and not on rush, the only mental split I make is bands who\u000a\u000aA: benefit from the progress that prog rock/metal has made by applying now mainstreamed but previously uncommon ideas to their music, but still create something unique enough to be considered progressive\u000a\u000aB: Heavily contribute to the progressive genre by applying techniques, styles, and ideas that are uncommon, under explored, or nigh unheard of.\u000a\u000aMost bands nowadays are a mixture of both, some more of one , and some more of the other. No matter which way you slice it, progressive music is a near impossible to properly define genre, so in the end it all ends up being super subjective.

aVIf you're new to this band, I would recommend checking out some of their earlier music. The previous guitar player had a truly unique playing style, similar to how one would play a sitar (an Indian classical stringed instrument); but on an electric guitar. It really put some  and Carnatic music (Southern Indian melody) tinge to the progressive rock/metal they were playing.  \u000a\u000aSome songs:  \u000a\u000a[Fields Of Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe0OaLv6e0M)  \u000a\u000a[Mindstreet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpnAWWDDqD8)\u000a\u000a[Broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0QbmHvXqzI)  \u000a\u000a[Chasing The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkgRuN3COII)

aVCongrats on having helped educate a truly great guitarist and musician.\u000a\u000aHe clearly has a wonderful sense of phrasing, tone, voicings etc.\u000a\u000a... and from what his playing sounds like, he's a big fan of Steve Vai and has learnt a lot from him as well. That might be another reason why I like his playing so much.
p1238
aVYeah he is the kind of guitarist who can play anything from jazz to metal to classical. He was and is a musician"s musician. He is about to start his doctorate in popular music as well!
p1239
aVI also have to add that I didn't teach him guitar. As I said earlier he was ridiculously good when he first joined my class. I remember his first assessment with me was playing "Blackbird" and he performed it better than the original. I thought to myself, what the fuck am I going to teach THIS kid?    Later that year we formed a German metal band and performed a song we "wrote" called Der Frosch (or whatever "the frog" is in German). We got an International student to scream the title over and over while Sam shredded along with a pretty handy drummer we had, and me trying to keep up on bass. It was hilarious. We killed it on Mulitcultural Day. Good times.

p1245
aVJust googled them and started listening to it. Didn't like it at all at first and didn't feel a "flow" to it. It iratated me to the point were I had to listen again to see what I missed. Then again and again and god damn it I love it! It's pretty much prog rock in a nutshell

aVWhen I was 10 years old my dad bought me a guitar. I didn't really know what I wanted to do with it until I was 13. That's when I saw an older kid at my DOD school in Spain shred during my music class. Heavy metal. It was amazing. When I was 12 or 13, my dad hooked me up with that older kid, got me some music lessons with him. As it turns out, that guy's dad worked with my dad in the same shop. So he came over a few times and gave me some inspiring lessons, my dad gave him some cash.\u000a\u000aI'm now 26 years old and I've seen his band, Periphery, play 3 times as they tour all around the world.

p1270
(lp1271
VWhenever someone bad mouths LaBrie, I always wish they'd listen to Ayreon's "Human Equation" album. No matter what you think of his work with Dream Theater, I think we can all agree he was amazing on that album.
p1272
aVStrangely, I almost always like him better in non-DT stuff. I just can't stand it when he tries to sound like Hetfield. The heavier phase DT through in the 00s didn't play to his strengths.
p1273
aVAs a singer, working with different producers makes you sound differently. When Petrucci is producing he always seems to be searching for the "perfect" take (correct pitch, speed, volume etc.) rather than the most emotional take, which can make LaBrie's voice sound dull and less powerful than it should be.
p1274
aVAwesome performance on an even more awesome album.
p1275
aVuhh, i thought he was absolutely terrible on that album.  Which is weird because he was pretty decent on Ocatavarium and they botth came out the same year.
p1276
aV[deleted]
p1277
aVI may be majorly biased as a huge fan of the group, but I definitely agree with you. \u000a\u000aYes, his voice is not everyone's cup of tea, and yes, it certainly isn't as powerful as it once was either. But over the years he's come to regain much of that power and can certainly hold his own in a live setting now. \u000a\u000aJust compare a number of live recordings from the Falling into Infinity/Scenes from a Memory era to how he's sounded on the last two or three tours. He's undeniably improved as a vocalist. He knows his limits/strengths now and sticks to them for the most part.\u000a\u000aTo me, he complements the music of Dream Theater perfectly. His voice is distinctive and gels with their music better than any other singer I could see performing with them potentially. Grandiose, soaring moments balanced with sensitive and emotive ones. \u000a\u000aGreat singer overall, and one deserving major props for what he does and the work he's done to get where he is presently.\u000a
p1278
aVWait, you're suggesting he got *better*?\u000a\u000aHe was undeniably at his peak in 93-94, before the vocal chord poisoning. 
p1279
aVNo, not saying he's at his best now, just that his voice as it currently stands is better than it was post-food poisoning. I agree that he was at his best in the 92-94 period, I'm just saying that as of now, he's recovered quite a bit of what he's lost.\u000a\u000aHe's certainly not where he was during the Images/Awake era, but he's been steadily getting better since recovering from that food poisoning, and is sounding quite good now. 
p1280
aVLive, maybe.\u000a\u000aIn studio i still prefer SFAM era
p1281
aVYeah, in studio he's moved away from his old operatic style to more of a snarly generic tone. He still has his moments, but his studio peak was definitely the 90s
p1282
aVpersonally, i feel james is better than their 2nd vocalist, [charlie dominici](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l326glc1XQ)
p1283
aVTheir first vocalist wasn't much better. Especially considering he may or may not have gotten John Myung so angry the other band members had to restrain him.
p1284
aVJohn Myung has emotions?
p1285
aVApparently he doesn't take kindly to being introduced as "And on bass, from the jungles of Korea..."
p1286
aVAbsolutely. Charlie isn't a bad singer, but he was the wrong guy for DT. That said, there's still a charm to that first album, warts and all.

aVMy favorite by far is [The Killing Hand.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oez4tDWeEHA)
p1289
aVI agree. The Killing Hand is actually spectacular. I can't say much more for basically the rest of the album, though. 
p1290
aVI've always felt LaBrie is an extremes kind of guy: he's either really good or really bad and almost never in the middle. He's very inconsistent basically, but when he's on he's fantastic. He's gotten markedly better live over the years (see the Live In Tokyo to see how terrible he used to be) but he's always been pretty good in the studio. He's just one of those really polarizing singers that people tend to either love or hate. I've actually started to like him less over the years based on comparisons to others... I listen to Michael Erikson for example and LaBrie sounds much worse all of a sudden to my ears. \u000a\u000aBut hey, if James LaBrie is the WORST part of your band then you're doing pretty damned good! :)

aVshit it was Constant Motion:\u000a"Forever more\u000aInto the night\u000aLISTERINE!"
p1299
aV"Take the Time" is my favorite DT song.  I can't get enough of it.  Thanks for posting it.
p1300
aVI tend not to be a fan of happier songs, but Take the Time is just amazingly infectious and has so much enthusiasm. James LaBrie's vocals are perfect for it.
p1301
aVI would probably hate LaBrie if it weren't for those early albums, I can only ever dream of reaching the notes he hits in Take the Time. It's definitely on my list of top 5 DT songs ever. 
p1302
aVLaBrie makes the song shine, but really, everything about it is killer. The guitar/keyboard part at at 4:49 is so awesome, and actually the entire instrumental section just doesn't get mentioned enough when it comes to DT instrumental segments. I like to whistle along to vocal lines, but when I reach the high notes of Take the Time I'm stuffed - not a chance. 
p1303
aVHaha yeah, Take the Time is probably the song that made me fall in love with Dream Theater as a band.
p1304
aVFor me it was Stream of Consciousness.
p1305
aVLet's not forget his solo work. Static Impulse and Impermanent Resonance are two of my favorite albums, and I like them better than even the last two Dream Theater albums.
p1306
aVI think his solo stuff suits him much better than the DT stuff as well. I dislike his vocal style when used in the context of DT, but in his solo stuff he's actually really good. 
p1307
aVI always thought he peaked on Live at the Marquee...so early on. He sounded unbelievable on that album. I still love some newer stuff though, I find the heavier songs suit him more.\u000a\u000aBut that's not to say Scenes from a Mem isn't a perfectly sung, classic prog-metal album...Labrie is also amazing there. I love Count of Tuscany too, phenomenal and me and the wife always sing along to it. \u000a\u000aBut yeah sometimes I feel it's take it or leave it with him. There's no doubt though that when he shines, it's literally blinding and there doesn't seem anyone better suited to Dream Theater. He's a true anomaly in some cases. The songs you mentioned in your post and loads of others, old and new, he can just sound amazing. \u000a\u000aI just can't pin down what's missing sometimes. Then other times I realise. I still go to see DT though.
p1308
aV&gt; I always thought he peaked on Live at the Marquee\u000a\u000aHis performance in The Killing Hand is the performance that I fantasise about doing. His range is incredible in that song
p1309
aV&gt; I find the heavier songs suit him more\u000a\u000aReally? I think the heavier stuff can get pretty cringeworthy.
p1310
aVAll a matter of personal taste, I guess...I liked the heavier style of Dream Theater - everything from Train of Thought to Black Clouds....that "era" of the band did produce some cracking heavy tunes....but overall yeah its definitely a mixed bag for me. I prefer the heavier music style generally, even though Scenes is my favourite of all of them which falls out of that range I guess. As I say it's a mixed bag from start to finish but I do love some of those heavy moments...
p1311
aVYeah a lot of their heavier stuff is pretty awesome but I personally don't think LaBrie's voice is suitable for that kind of music. Just my personal opinion, of course.
p1312
aVI love me some Labrie. Didn't care for him at first, took a couple years in fact, but now I really respect him as a vocalist. I recognize that he had a hard time for awhile, but I think he's recovered pretty well. I've seen them live 4 times since systematic, and he gets better each time.\u000a\u000aCheck out his solo albums if you haven't, he sounds great in them.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUA5PMuvijs\u000a
p1313
aVMost people don't understand how manly the dude is. The reason his voice is the way it is, is because he was in Chile and he got food poisoning. He vomited so hard and so much, that he RUPTURED HIS VOCAL CHORDS. And he recovered and chose to keep on singing. Pretty badass imo.\u000a\u000aSource: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_LaBrie#Food_poisoning_incident

[**Food poisoning incident**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_LaBrie#Food_poisoning_incident) of article  [**James LaBrie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20LaBrie): [](#sfw) \u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&gt;On December 29, 1994, while vacationing in Cuba, LaBrie was stricken with a severe case of [food poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_poisoning) from contaminated shrimp and while vomiting, he ruptured his vocal cords. He saw three throat specialists who all said there was nothing they could do except have him rest his voice as much as possible. However, on January 12, 1995, and against doctor's orders, he was on the [Waking Up the World Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_the_World_Tour) in Japan promoting *[Awake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awake_(Dream_Theater_album\u005c))* album with his voice far from normal.  LaBrie has said he did not feel vocally "normal" until at least 2002. LaBrie has said that this was a very hard time for him as a singer, and depression as a result caused him to consider departing from the band, although his bandmates supported him and told him to stay. After the *Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'*s [World Tourbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourbulence) he discovered that his voice had fully returned. He has said that his voice was fully healed by time and training. \u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a^Interesting: [^One ^More ^Time ^\u005c(James ^LaBrie ^song)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_More_Time_\u005c(James_LaBrie_song\u005c)) ^| [^Static ^Impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_Impulse) ^| [^MullMuzzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MullMuzzler) ^| [^Impermanent ^Resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanent_Resonance) \u000a\u000a^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+comuvoa) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+comuvoa)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
p1315
aVyou are a lovely bot
p1316
aVI'm not sure DT would have made it big time if it weren't for Labrie. His singing on Images and Words is outstanding!\u000a\u000aThat being said, he has plenty of cringe moments
p1317
aVWhat could have been.  He had food poisoning in 1994 from some bad shellfish and ruptured his vocal cords from all of the vomiting.  This was right after Awake.  He's still an exceptional singer, but you can tell the difference between Awake and Infinity/Metropolis 2.  The parts they wrote for him were nowhere near as high and exciting.  He said right around BCaSL he recovered, and that was his strongest album since awake.\u000a\u000aAlso nowadays I feel like he doesn't have the chops to sing some of his high notes from earlier songs.  He really strains on some and seems tentative on them as well.  I'm not crazy on his parts for the post-Portnoy albums, he doesn't really have many standout performances.\u000a\u000aI loooove him on Human Equation. The lower area of his voice has a lot of depth and Arjen wrote to that.  He also had some very impressive screams like the one at the very end.\u000a\u000aAll in all, he is one of my favorite metal singers, but I think he missed most of his prime singing years afflicted by the ruptured vocal cords.  
p1318
aVI duno man. I'd say his chops are fine. He pretty much nailed Innoscence Faded on the SCORE! DVD, and he really belts it out during the "mothers for their children" section of Illumination Theory.
p1319
aVI'm not saying he can't belt it. But you can tell he has much more trouble than he did on awake. He owned awake and sailed for those high notes. His approach had to be very different after he got sick.  I've heard him say in interviews that he didn't feel really strong in his voice for 10-12 years and those were the best singing years of his life. 
p1320
aVHe still hits the notes, but you can tell that he's putting all his effort into just hitting them. Back in the day he'd smash the note and then do whatever the hell else he wanted to do with it. He had so much control and he could pretty much do what he wanted with his voice, thats the biggest thing thats missing now. The absolute range is still there
p1321
aVSince every time people talk about him, no one mentions the live album where he sings the songs from the first one, the one with Dominici, I think it must be consensus that he was HORRIBLE in that one. Seriously, he throws some highs in the songs that are absolutely terrible.
p1322
aVi love him, but it took a while to get used to. i can see why a lot of people are put off, but i think he suits the band well.
p1323
aVHe sounds best when he is most raw. The more overproduced I've heard him, the less satisfying. DT's newest album for example, is one of the most lacking vocally, spare Illumination Theory. That is because he sounds robotic for most of the album but really gets raw and dirty in Illumination Theory. Secondly, for a long chunk of his career he was dealing with getting over food poisoning, which really messed up his range for a while (which lead to him requiring a bunch of studio effects in the meantime). Overall, incredible singer but has lately been held back by Petrucci's writing style and production.\u000a
p1324
aVI used to really love JLB on the older DT stuff, his voice suited their music perfectly... But all their new stuff (SC and forward, but ADTOE and beyond especially) I dunno, he really annoys me :/
p1325
aVForsaken has always stood out to me as what sounds like Labrie straining against his vocal range. I'll listen to it again, but I vividly remember when he says "forsaken," it really bothering me.
p1326
aVHe's got a great voice, and it's easily recognizable too. But even though he's near-perfect on studio albums, he's pretty annoying on live recordings, imo.
p1327
aVHe used to really over do it with his vibrato in the past, but he's really got it under control in recent years. I wonder if he started working with a new vocal coach.
p1328
aVI love DT and have a been a huge fan for many years, but I really can't stand Labrie i think he's awful and DT would be so much better with a different vocalist.

asVGood Guitar Effects Pedals for Prog?
p1330
(lp1331
V[Strymon Timeline](http://www.strymon.net/timeline/) is a great delay pedal. I don't have one, but I've used one.\u000a\u000aedit: not sure what you mean by a "suboctaver" but the [EHx POG2](http://www.ehx.com/products/pog2) lets you add layers of -2, -1, +1, and +2 octaves for some amazing density. 
p1332
aVHey, that's pretty much exactly what I meant by a suboctaver, thanks.\u000a\u000aBut man, that delay pedal looks pretty nice. The built-in looper is a nice touch, too.
p1333
aVYou could get a Line 6 M9 for delay chorus, and misc..  \u000a\u000aIf you want standalones, there's the Line 6 Echo Park and the DL4.  Their Digital Delay is just my favorite delay sound. But there's tons of good stuff out there, and preference is a big part of it.\u000a\u000aFor reverb, for general use, the Hardwire RV-7 is awesome.  For octo/shimmer, the Strymon Bluesky is the best.  And it has a saveable preset so you can toggle a shimmer verb and a more regular verb.  If you need to save cash, the Line 6 Octo is the 2nd best, and their regular verbs are really good too.  That would be the Verbzilla pedal (no presets though).\u000a\u000aChorus/Vibe I really love my BBE Mind Bender.  But the new EQD Sea Machine (V2) looks sweet too.  It's not out yet I don't think.\u000a\u000aWah and volume I will always go Morley.  Pots are for suckers.\u000a\u000a

aVThanks for the great list! I'm gonna have to do a lot of research, and see if I can source a few of these to try out. :)
p1335
aVGet an MXR Carbon Copy. I had one and would just play with it for hours on end. It's perfect for clean delays and I honestly wouldn't recommend anything else.

p1342
(lp1343
VSeeing them play for Periphery's tour in February. Pretty good, all-in-all, although I'm mostly going for Periphery and Thank You Scientist.
p1344
aVYeah, TyS and Periphery were great, and their *music* was definitely what I was most looking forward to, but Nothing More put on probably the  best *show*, in terms of spectacle, without taking anything away from the music (and in most cases, adding to it).
p1345
aVI saw them Friday! Wovenwar also played. I had the lowest expectations for Nothing More, and was ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY. They were incredible. Obviously the others were also good, Spencer Sotelo was ill but still sounded fantastic. 10/10 would see all the bands again. 
p1346
aVYeah they were awesome!!  So much energy in their show.
p1347
aVTheir sound is pretty awesome, but this album has the worst lyrics I've heard in a very long time. It ruins the music for me.
p1348
aVYup. Vaguely anti-establishment mediocrity, or vaguely philosophical/religious questioning. That's definitely an area that FtM was amazing, they really had wonderful lyrics.\u000a\u000aSame reason why I didn't actually post the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXxHwOkYEYs) for this song, fairly cringey to go with the lyrics. Would rather just try to focus on the timbres than actual words.
p1349
aVIn fairness to most other bands, comparing lyric writing to FtM isn't exactly fair :P\u000a\u000aI'm ambivalent towards NM's lyrics. They're certainly not Pop Evil levels of bad, and songs like "Jenny" and "God Went North" are personal and do feel like they have some emotion attached to them. That being said, there are definitely some cringe-worthy lyrics on here.
p1350
aVSo lyrically nothing special, but the range of vocal styles and instrumental textures make this a pretty cool song, especially the bridge is a bit of surprise. This album swings from metal to altrock, but quite a few memorable earworms. I miss FtM, so it was nice to find something similar (catchy tunes, cool if not overly complex guitar work, easy to follow song structures that still can throw a curveball once in a while).\u000a\u000aI haven't listened to any of their earlier stuff yet, had checked them out a couple months ago when I saw they would be touring with Periphery and enjoyed it a lot. Speaking of which, their live show was great, some cool elements that really put on a show beyond just playing the music. Could have been gimmicky and cheesy, but they pulled it off really well.
p1351
aVWhile I'd hesitate to call these guys prog, they certainly have some easily identifiable influences. It's cool to visit their Facebook page and see bands like Twelve Foot Ninja, Karnivool, and Fair to Midland quoted. \u000a\u000aTheir newest album actually ended up being one of my favorites last year. Out of any band that gets mainstream play, I think these guys were the most deserving of the number 1 single they got. Looking forward to seeing them in February.
p1352
aVTheir last album, The Few Not Fleeting, has some songs that definitely remind me of FTM. This album, not so much but the song God Went North might have you thinking of FTM
p1353
aVJust saw them last night and they put on such a cool show. Made a new fan.
p1354
aVIt's cool. I wouldn't call them prog though. More like metalcore.

aV[Oh...](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7erl9k01C2M/hqdefault.jpg)
p1360
aVThis is one band I'll never understand. They seemed poised for greatness after the 2nd album. Then the 3rd album was a disappointing mess (being harsh) then they refuse to tour the US after successfully touring Australia and Europe like mad. \u000a\u000aI think this is a band that is afraid of success. 
p1361
aVCompletely disagree with regards to Asymmetry. While it didn't have quite the same immediacy as Sound Awake, it really grew on me with it's subtle, understated intricacies. The production, while less digestible at first really lends itself to a more live band feel which makes the soft parts feel more delicate and the big parts even harsher and uglier. I love asymmetry, and think cuts like Aeons and Eidolon are some of the best Karnivool songs to date.
p1362
aVSounds good. What about Themata?
p1363
aVI didn't get Asymmetry when I first heard it, actually, but it really grew on me. It has even more of that Karnivool *ick*-ness than Themata and Sound Awake. Their music has that feeling of *existence is nasty and shitty - but maybe that's ok*, which is so much more important (I think) than the metal bits.\u000a\u000aI wish I could see Aeons live. Someday... (but apparently not in April...)
p1364
aVAsymmetry was fucking beautiful man 
p1365
aVAsymmetry is about the most original and well written rock album in recent history. \u000a\u000aSeriously, maybe it goes over people's heads, but the intricacy of their writing is astounding.\u000a\u000aGo listen to aeons like five hundred times.
p1366
aVI think it's an overreaction to call Asymmetry a "mess." Yes, it was less polished and arguably not as good as SA, but that's like trying to be better than perfect. SA's one of those once in a lifetime things where everything on that album just fell into place in exactly the right way for so many people. Yes, bands always strive to be better than their last album, but how many fall into the trap of trying to make their defining album over and over again and sounding stale?\u000a\u000aAsymmetry was Karnivool stepping back from the precisely-made trappings of SA and making their sound more raw and organic. There may have been some unneeded filler and some songs that were a little weaker, but it was by no means terrible. "Aeons," "Sky Machine," and "Eidolon" were among my favorite tracks of 2013, and it easily found its way into my top 10 albums of that year. It's a shame it gets shit-talked by fans as much as it does.
p1367
aV[deleted]
p1368
aVYou need to listen to the album a couple of times with some good headphones.  The album is what it's called: asymmetric.  Chaotic.  Disorderly.  The time signatures clash, guitars battle each other, the drums are cacophonous.  The bass is distorted and booming.  It's a lot to take in the first listen.\u000a\u000aBut the album is all about finding the order in the chaos.  Listen to it a couple more times, and you'll see that it is creative, thematic, and cohesive.  Ian sounds (imo) amazing, he really belts it out at points.\u000a\u000aI'll admit that Sound Awake still remains my favorite Karnivool album, but Asymmetry has some of my favorite tracks they've put out, including Nachash, Aeons, and, most importantly, Sky Machine.

VThis is actually really good. Y'all might like saxophones and melds with jazz and metalcore, but it's nice to see some more death stuff. \u000a\u000aThe riff at 7:00 sounds a lot like classical music. Which is always nice.
p1372
aVThis is one of my favorite metal albums of all time.\u000a\u000aThey are Christian Metal FYI.
p1373
aVMeaning no disrespect, but is it entirely necessary to elaborate on that? I mean, yes it happens to be Christian, but what does that  mean in regards to the music? Like I said, I don't mean any disrespect, and I get down to some BTA and Extol myself, I just don't see a real reason for bringing up their faith in this particular setting.
p1374
aVIs there a reason not to? The lyrical content isn't secular with a religious backing... It's pretty much gospel.\u000a\u000aI honestly find it is a neat tidbit. That's all.\u000a\u000a*Super heavy metal band, harsh vocals: did you know the are a christian band?*  \u000a*Oh really, I never would have guessed*  \u000a\u000aBut yeah. It's better to never mention the R, C, and G word on reddit.\u000a\u000aedits: for formatting.\u000a
p1375
aVI can understand that. Personally, I'm not very lyrically inclined, so I guess it just seems arbitrary to me. I do think it's cool that they can express their beliefs in a notoriously non-secular setting, I just see a lot of people mention that kind of thing unnecessarily and get a ton of shit for it.\u000a\u000aEdit: a word

p1377
aVI dunno. A lot of people automatically turn their nose up towards Christian bands. Which justifiably so. But I mean a lot of people scoff at Stryper but To Hell With The Devil is actually a really good album. Just like Christian black metal bands get a lot of flack. So in my experience people automatically think "Christian" means "not as good" which isn't really fair

asVAge restrictions at shows
p1381
(lp1382
VI have a love hate relationship with the concept of 18+ shows. \u000a\u000aOn one hand I understand that most of the time it's the venue that stipulates it's 18+ due to their liqueur licences (at least that's why here in Australia) and it sucks to know that there are fans who don't get the opportunity to see their favourite bands play because they're not of age. I missed the chance to see Porcupine Tree tour here for this exact reason.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, every single all ages show I've been too has been full of the most disrespectful crowd members. Yelling at the artists, talking during songs, picking fights, you name it. So I will always attend the 18+ shows if given the choice to avoid that behavior. 
p1383
aVI've never been to a show with problems with the crowd. Everyone have always been happy and you always seem to find new nice people at the shows. This may just be the case for shows in general here in Sweden as the metal culture is more than established here and everyone is there to have fun. \u000a\u000aThe liqueur license thing is probably the reason it's 18+ (nice to know Sweden and Australia has something in common) and I know that. Still sucks but I guess I'll have to accept it. 
p1384
aVAhhh the culture thing could definitely be it. \u000a\u000aOne thing I've noticed here is that they'll put a more "age appropriate" opening act on before a bigger band at an all ages show to fill the room. Generally it's some semi-popular core band that gets the crowd all rowdy.\u000a\u000a
p1385
aVTry calling the venue and ask what kinda id you'll need. I was at a show that was 15+ a few weeks ago. But to of my younger friends were going who are both 14 .they called ahead and the venue pretty much said that if they looked it they'd let em in.

Red Fang and Opeth within a day of each other here, just months before my 18th, as well as many other tours including Enter Shikari, Suffocation + Decapitated, Architects, Psycroptic + Disentomb and sleepmakeswaves all before my 18th too. If Periphery or Devin Townsend do this to me I will probably cry.

VI have a demo version of the song Weightless that was released even before the self-titled. I also have a demo of the Price of Everything but it doesn't differ very much from the album version. I'll upload them when I get home from work!  \u000a\u000aHere are the two demos I have, I believe I got them from PureVolume a long time ago.\u000a\u000a[Animals as Leaders - Hyphens (Weightless demo)](https://clyp.it/j12wobas)  \u000a[Animals as Leaders - 1st Idea (The Price of Everything and Value of Nothing demo](https://clyp.it/dwkt1cyo)\u000a\u000aI was actually really disappointed that the bit at 4:21 in Hyphens was only used once in the studio version of Weightless. That was what made the song for me, honestly.\u000a  \u000aSome other interesting things:  \u000a\u000a* Navene is either sampling or using the same effect from Do Not Go Gently in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G5sSbTEBWU)  \u000a  \u000a* Bulb posted almost the entire self-titled album nearly four months before its release [in this thread.](http://smnnews.com/board/showthread.php?t=198139) I still remember hearing Tempting Time for the first time and being absolutely mind fucked.\u000a  \u000a* Reflux was also comprised of Evan Brewer on bass and Ash Avildsen (CEO of Sumerian Records) on vocals.\u000a\u000a* Navene also played in one of the earliest and greatest deathcore bands of all time, [Animosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Psk61luXiE). Evan Brewer played bass with them as well.

aVI'm pretty sure you covered it all! I've been following them since Animals as Leaders (Self Titled) came out and have been trying to sink my claws into whatever is released that even remotely has to do with a member of AAL. Nothing but love for present and past members. 
p1427
aVReflux was my favorite band when I was 17. Hearing Tosin play live for the first time totally blew my mind. He was only about 20 at the time. My band played with them a couple times. Back then he wasn't famous yet, so he was super cool and would always spend a bunch of time talking to me about guitar, and technique, and what he was listening to. He was (and still is) a huge inspiration to my playing.

asVEver Forthright - Spineless
p1436
(lp1437
VIn my opinion, this is the heaviest, most in-your-face song that I've listened to (even compared to Meshuggah's "Bleed"). There's just something about this song that gives me chills which no other harsh/heavy metal band gives me.
p1438
aVThe lyrics are in your face too. This song is up there with Danza.
p1439
aVThis was the first EF song written, and you can tell. It definitely stands out on the album (and not just as the heaviest track). I think the end is a little overdone, but otherwise I agree that it is a very good 'in your face metal' song. 
p1440
aVI always really liked [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqq2cj5Ecms) by them. 
p1441
aVThis is my favorite by them. I don't like the Meshuggah-type stuff, so the song posted by OP isn't my favorite. I love Baretto's vocals.

asVJust saw The Contortionist live.... Holy.Titties.
p1443
(lp1444
VJust got back from the Toronto show as well. First time seeing any of the bands live, and it was great! The Contortionist was indeed fucking amazing. 10/10\u000a\u000aWhat'd you think of ToothGrinder, Fallujah, and Revocation?
p1445
aVi got off work so i missed the first two but Revocation were really sweet. reminded me of when I saw Trivium right when Ascendency came out, great crowd and you can tell they're about to make a big leap.
p1446
aVI hadn't heard of Revocation before this tour announcement, but when I did I really really enjoyed listening through their discography. So much great music by them. I agree they played great.
p1447
aVBig leap? They've already got 4 full length releases on Relapse and an EP.
p1448
aVIn notoriety?
p1449
aV&gt; notoriety\u000a\u000ayeah
p1450
aVToothgrinder was great! My brain automatically associated them with grindcore when I heard their name so I never checked them out prior to the show, so I was pleasantly surprised with their spastic style of prog metal.\u000a\u000aI was DYING to see Fallujah as their latest album was probably my favourite of 2014. Their set was really intense, I just wish the guitars were a bit louder. The whole band is so tight with their instruments, especially that drummer!\u000a\u000aI think Revocation had the best sound mixing of the night. Dave absolutely slayed! I'm actually surprised that the crowd had so many Revocation fans; I wouldn't think there would be a whole lot of crossover between fans of The Contortionist and them. Witch Trials was easily the highlight of the set (dem solos)!
p1451
aVI wasn't sure what to expect from Toothgrinder at first either, but I listened through their two (Unfortunately short under 20min) EP's before hand and really liked them. Hopefully they put out something a little lengthier in the future!\u000a\u000aFallujah played well but I never really got into them. Gave The Flesh Prevails a bunch of listens and it never really clicked with me.\u000a\u000aLoved Revocation, great song writing and tasty riffs/solos. Witch Trials felt like the perfect closer song.
p1452
aVI didn't realize they had another EP on top of Schizophrenic Jubilee, I'll check it out! I hope this band gets bigger, they deserve the attention.\u000a\u000aI can understand why people wouldn't like Fallujah. It wasn't until their Nomadic EP when I started really enjoying their stuff. The Flesh Prevails has a different feel compared to that EP, perhaps give that a spin and see how you feel about it. If they had made a whole album with Nomadic-style songs I would probably bust a nut, although I still love TFP.
p1453
aVYeah their earlier EP doesn't appear to be on iTunes, rather on their [bandcamp](http://toothgrinder.bandcamp.com/) (Name your price, $0 or more). I prefer Schizophrenic Jubilee but this one is still pretty solid.\u000a\u000aI'll check out the Fallujah EP for sure.
p1454
aVI have seen them 10 times already and this lineup is really awesome. This tour was cool as they did some new sounds live such as adding the 8 bit intro to Oscillator. Their last headliner with Intervals and Polyphia was nuts when their old singer came on stage during Exoplanet trilogy.\u000a\u000aIn short, The Contortionist are awesome live.
p1455
aVSaw them in the UK a few months ago and damn they were incredible.  Their singer is absolutely hypnotic live, couldn't stop watching him stumble around the stage.
p1456
aVyeah! it was trippy but he is one hell of a performer
p1457

aVFrom my experience most stuff with harsh vocals gets downvoted in /r/Music, but whatever.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe ending to this song is my favourite part, the quiet lyrics followed up by them repeated super aggressively. 
p1472
aVWell I've seen Converge up there before, so I thought I could get a bit bolder. \u000a\u000aMy favorite part is 1:55, it's so weird, but also melodic at the same time.
p1473
aVLove this album, but to call it prog?
p1474
aVI'd defend the label. I think they have and showcase a ton of different influences in their music and the way they dilute and play with time signatures is mind bending. Is it mathcore? Yes. It is also progressive? Yes. 
p1475
aVFair enough. I myself have often wondered what exactly is the difference, if there's any, between prog and so-called mathcore. The definition of the latter reads like something that applies word-for-word to prog.
p1476
aVMost progressive metal I feel, is structured in a more classical way. Whereas Mathcore or Mathrock is a lot more "all over the place" and hectic. They are pretty similar though, definition wise. They share a lot of the same characteristics. 
p1477
aVI would call TDEP prog in the same way that Meshuggah is considered prog.

VOh trust me dude, /r/progmetal is well aware of Thank You Scientist. I believe they actually did an AMA all the way back in 2013. They're an incredible band. I've seen tons and tons of live shows but I can confidently say that I've never seen a live guitarist perform better than Tom Monda. Every single note is crystal clear. He can shred just as fast as Jeff Loomis. His note choices are impeccable. His sense of melody, groove, arrangement, all of it is top notch. Not to mention the fretless guitar.  \u000a  \u000aI actually booked and played with Thank You Scientist in a small basement venue last April. I think we had maybe 15 people turn out? Their next tour was direct support for Coheed and Cambria and following that is the current Periphery tour. What a huge jump to make. It couldn't happen to nicer people, either.
p1485
aVOh they get plenty of love around here, don't worry! Fantastic band, they were one of my favorite openers for Coheed yet. I seriously can't wait for their next album if [Blue Automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDJBL1gqHxE) is anything to go by. \u000a\u000aBy the way, shoutout for /r/thankyouscientist!

VYou could join a metal band playing fretless bass having never played an instrument before and still be fellated by the entire metal community.
p1499
aVI think it's quite the opposite actually. A fretless bassist often become a "selling" aspect of the band, which leads said band to bring the bass way up in the mix, which is exactly the case in Beyond Creation. If you are audible, people are going to notice pretty quick if you suck, fretless or not.

Their First, Second, and Third (Recent, Double album / Concept record) are all FANTASTIC and unique. Some people dislike Spencer as a singer for various reasons, dunno how you'd feel about it. Regardless, 6 fantastic talented dudes. Heavy, Catchy, Melodic all around. \u000a\u000a[The Contortionist, - Primal Directive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvPnewykSU4): A song off their first record. It's about the human race leaving for another planet. It's Heavy, Groovy as all damn fuck, with amazing tasteful ambient/instrumental sections. Their second and third records are also great too, though for the third record they changed direction a little in their sound in a way I'm not a fan of. All 3 are worth a listen though.\u000a\u000a[Ne Obliviscaris, - Painters Of The Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTiX-xAgBi8): A little Melodeath metal. Their first record is great. Love it to death, the melodies that can happen between Singing and Violin and their guitarists blow me away. Their second record is even better which is what I've linked here. \u000a\u000a[TesseracT, - Concealing Fate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBXVDyR7YC4): Their first record is heavier overall since the vocalist does harsh stuff, while the second is a little less so. But both groove like hell.\u000a

aVThe Ocean. I think they're probably (to the bands you mentioned) closest to BTBAM. I think The Ocean are way better though. Check out their newest album called Pelagial. It's a concept record about the ocean itself. The deeper into the record you get the darker, heavier, and denser it gets. It's in my top 10 favorite concept records of all time\u000a\u000aPlus it's humorous- a band called The Ocean releases an album *about* the ocean titled a fancy ass way of saying *the ocean*. Cracks me up. The only one beter is Black Sabbath's song Black Sabbath on the album Black Sabbath. \u000a\u000aLink to album stream (forgive me): http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZMTDcqKnQ
p1519
aVAlright, I may be a bit biased. But if you like BTBAM you should like Black Crown Initiate. Here's [their EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhY8-iJnZ-M), they do have a full length, but their EP is just... perfection.  \u000a  \u000aIf you like Protest the Hero you will like [Sikth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTy_FKOAI4w). They are basically an earlier version of Protest the Hero.  \u000a  \u000aI have to go with Intervals if you like Animals as Leaders. Here's their instrumental EP [In Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyBrxxUWO28). Their full length is very good IMO but everyone points to this EP as their definitive work.  \u000aTheir drummer, Anup Sastry, also releases solo material constantly, which you can find for free on bandcamp. I'm very partial to the [Titan EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WvRGUiRGoo) and the [Lion EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vZW4jlKuSY). He released a full length as well called [Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1OBJm3dcdQ) which is really good but I like the EPs more.  \u000aHe records the drums live and also records guitars live. But to note, he doesn't play guitar, he records one note at a time and arranges them in the software. Crazy as hell but very talented.  \u000a  \u000aI don't listen to Tool or Mastodon so you're on your own for that.

VTesseract! One has some harsh vocals on it but I find it to be overall a much more heavier and emotional album than Altered State (which is still pretty damn good and entirely clean). \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGCn6g95PBY\u000a\u000a\u000aDevin Townsend has been mentioned. He doesn't do much harsh vocal stuff these days and when he does it's usually very tasteful and minimal. Z2: Dark Matters has some very heavy riffs but also tends to lend itself to sounding "grand" before "heavy", if that makes sense.\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9AcP3VHiak#t=2192\u000a\u000a\u000aKatatonia's latest albums have had crazy heavy moments and use entirely clean vocals. They're not all that progressive though but still have great balance between heavy riffs and clean sections similar to Opeth in that respect.\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moZwgUex4aA\u000a\u000a\u000aBreaking Orbit have some heavy stuff similar to that you'd find on a Tool album. It's not in your face heavy like Katatonia or filled with blast beats like Devin but it still counts.\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCE8DqZHjek\u000a\u000a\u000aCaligula's Horse are slowly becoming a popular name here on /r/progmetal and in the progressive scene in general. They're great a mixing the heavier, at times djenty, riffs with wonderful clean passages. That and Jim Grey has the voice of an angel. Also check out his other band Arcane. \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVvOPSupIsg\u000a\u000a\u000aDestiny Potato. If you're familiar with David Maxim Micic's BILO EP's then you'll like this.

He plays all the instruments, sings and engineers it all himself. Mute is a fantastic album that is incredible varied yet flows exceptionally. This song starts slow yet builds towards the end.\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfT_HjleDQ\u000a\u000a\u000aHaken.

aVYou *have* to check out Caligula's Horse. I like their newest album more but they're both good. It's a little different so don't just write it off right away. Give it a couple listens, you won't be disappointed.
p1538
aVI discovered "The Tide, the Thief and the River's End" a few weeks back. I've hardly been listening to anything else since.
p1539
aVExactly the same for me. Just discovered it and I can't not listen to it.
p1540
aVCaligula's Horse is good, but Arcane is *so much better*. But you can't go wrong with Grey's voice. 
p1541
aVI like Caligula's Horse way more than Arcane personally. I can't really get into Arcane. Not my cup of tea!
p1542
aVI tried out the linked song, didn't really dig it. I'll try a few others though
p1543
aVWhich one was that?
p1544
aVA Gift To Afterthought, I believe
p1545
aVIt's definitely kind of weird. I really recommend listening to the [whole album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f8w-Fowepc&amp;list=PLo2XzIBaNAUILDjJtJ4jy39Rk4VDZYvsp) through a couple times. I can almost guarantee you'll like it. It took me a few times and I can honestly say that I didn't like it the first time through.\u000a
p1546
aVI'll give it a shot
p1547
aVI second Katatonia, Dead End Kings and The Great Cold Distance are both great.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8rfqSuq8_Q
p1548
aVSome good stuff here. Thanks for introducing me to a few bands that I have never heard.
p1549
aVHorizons expanded.  I already knew about Tesseract (which I found out about the same way previously) but Haken will have me occupied for the next few hours, thanks much.
p1550
aV[deleted]
p1551
aVI'd also toss in TFN http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKcRVT5LNbE
p1552
aVHoly shit, that first song is amazing. Thanks for this, will be checking out the rest of the stuff you posted. 
p1553
aVDemians is the best band(person?) I've discovered so far this year. Thanks!
p1554
aVSo, I checked out the Tesseract song you linked and loved it. I went on the website but there was no way to buy either of the albums. Where can I get them?\u000a\u000aEDIT: Found it on Amazon Prime. Listening to *One*, currently on Deception. Love it. The occasional screaming works within the music. Thanks for these guys.
p1555
aVNevermore - This Godless Endeavor is usually what I think of as heavy as fuck clean vocals. Very different style than "Shallow" though
p1556
aVNevermore are so goddamn heavy I had been listening to them for about a year before I noticed they had no death growls.
p1557
aVDevin townsends epicloud album. Tesseract's altered state, sky harbors blinding white noise
p1558
aVDude, yes! That ending riff of More! was so Heavy Devy + Lamb of God!
p1559
aVI thought of it more like swedish melodeath and lamb of god. fuckin SWEET riff tho
p1560
aVSadly TesseracT  went back to their old vocalist a few months back... no more glorious high notes 
p1561
aVBro do you even Dan Tompkins? He can easily hit all those notes, give him another chance with this next album.
p1562
aVDan has already been singing the songs in their shows and he has vids of his own featuring the highs, im excited 
p1563
aVwhile I prefer Dan over Ashe (both of them are fucking amazing), I couldn't help but notice that Dan has a lot of troubles hitting the really high notes from Altered State live. Especially Nocturne and Resist.
p1564
aVHe hits notes that Ashe wouldn't even attempt live (literally). Ashe would sing the lower harmonies and blend in to the backing track, but Dan belts the high stuff and they use much less backing tracks with him.
p1565
aVDan actually hits notes live, that Ashe couldn't hit. FROM THE ALBUM THAT ASHE SANG ON.
p1566
aVAshe's melodies and harmonies were incredible, but there's no question that Dan is technically the better vocalist.
p1567
aVDude, listen to Guiding Lights. 
p1568
aVI'm not even really a fan of Skyharbor, but Guiding Lights shit is cash.
p1569
aVGuiding Lights is incredibly good. It's my album of 2014.
p1570
aVIf you get the chance, go see them live! They're amazing. Tompkins is a force of nature.
p1571
aVThey are definitly on my list.
p1572
aV[Beyond the Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDPNW8o3WSU): Both male and female vocals. They do some interesting duet stuff.\u000a\u000a[Headspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzeO0rtUP0c): Damian Wilson on vocals.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Nightingale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnlL9StBA68): Dan Swanö, but clean vocals only.\u000a\u000a[Soen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TknvKdgt5Tc): Martin Lopez (Opeth) on drums. Joel Ekelöf (Willowtree) on vocals.\u000a\u000a[Myrath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rDQccuLEvY): Tunisian band. Incorporates some oriental tones.\u000a\u000a[Voyager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM5rZaUiiLs): Likes to use quite a bit of electronic sounding stuff. Almost all clean vocals.
p1573
aV+1 for Myrath, incredible vocals. 
p1574
aVSoen for sure. It's the perfect mix. Their new album is amazing.
p1575
aVIntronaut! They have been using less and less harsh vocals with each album. Their newest album is entirely clean. [Habitual Levitations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVcxDsY3vv4&amp;list=PLUz8i87oO7q0shPWkhJYY9SKntcjvAsMV)
p1576
aVAnd its just a fucking fantastic album on top of that.  Their best by far.  I wasn't sure how I felt when I heard it was all clean but the dual vocal harmony is amazing and the instrumentation just keeps getting better.  Top 5 of 2013 for me.
p1577
aVThank You Scientist. Its really OUT there, very progressive, really good.\u000a\u000a[My Famed Disappearing Act](http://youtu.be/Q3linGUrzts?list=PLE7y1hhP3pMMIOI403Mn9LgTwcq3_rFF4)\u000a\u000a[Feed the Horses](http://youtu.be/-c8Gw2HU5kc?list=PLE7y1hhP3pMMIOI403Mn9LgTwcq3_rFF4)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a[A Salesman's Guide to Non-existence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbQOYbDv8qc)
p1578
aVI see them everywhere on here. I really gotta check them out. 
p1579
aVYeah, I hadn't checked them out until about a month ago, and my only regret is not listening sooner :-) They might be bizarre at first, but I urge you to give it a few listens through and then you'll be hooked (hopefully lol).
p1580
aVI'm listening to them right now and I just saw them live last night!
p1581
aVSaw them on tour with Coheed &amp; Cambria. That was an awesome show.
p1582
aVBased on that Porcupine Tree song, you need some OSI right freakin' now.\u000a\u000a[Blood (full album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNPrUyKltL0)\u000a\u000aThey are Kevin Moore (ex-Dream Theater keys), Michael Portnoy on a lot of the drums, and Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos (FW bassist Joe DiBiase is on a lot of their material, too). Moore's vox are so quiet they're almost whispered. They use a guest vocalist here and there, one of them being Mikael Åkerfeldt.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of Fates Warning, you need some of them, too.\u000a\u000a[Parallels (full album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvM9CGZEHOE)\u000a\u000a
p1583
aVI'm  more partial to Fire Make Thunder, the later OSI album with Gavin Harrison(PT drummer), but Blood is still good.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EesaeFZU0dE
p1584
aVDefinitely, FMT is by far their most quality consistent album. [Invisible Men](http://youtu.be/4w89Af6TUcQ) still gives me goosebumps.
p1585
aVI've never heard anyone call Mike Portnoy "Michael".
p1586
aVI'll definitely get on that. 
p1587
aVHow about Karnivool's Themata album? Lifelike comes to my mind.
p1588
aVHow about all Karnivool?
p1589
aVThemata is their "heaviest" album tho IMO. Maybe you could call it straight-forward.
p1590
aV[simple boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjvtx3HMUks)\u000a\u000a[Cote](http://youtu.be/gUmARJ0o6Hw?list=PLVZDnb060I6n6hB2PGKkY4ZDHU4RvM3Ta)\u000a
p1591
aVDamn you. Now I will have to listen to everything of them again. And I only did it this morning... Can't wait to see them next month.
p1592
aVI thank Pandora for my knowing Karnivool
p1593
aV[deleted]
p1594
aVJust throwing some shit out there based on that porcupine tree song and what you said.  Warning: I'm a big fan of high-register male vocals and post-hardcore.  SO if you don't really like that, my list may not be that great.  \u000a\u000a[I Am Abomination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTrBzvGmtBU).  Absolutely love this album (didn't really like the previous ones).  I don't think there's any screaming. \u000a\u000a[Artifex Pereo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tli453fW6yk).  One of my favorite bands right now.  It's more just progressive than progressive metal.  I would prefer progressive over metal if I had to choose, so that's why I love this band.  About 95% cleans.  \u000a\u000a[Hail the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYlAaa3GhDE&amp;list=RDPYlAaa3GhDE).  Again, more progressive than metal, but they can get heavy.  What's even cooler is the drummer is singer.  Seeing him do that live is pretty incredible. About 80-85% cleans.  \u000a\u000aOhh yeah, [Intervals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Var6j5gD2qM)!  Some do not like the voice, but it's good enough for me.\u000a\u000aProtest the Hero?  \u000a\u000aEdit: I guess older [Dear Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqQ7kRj-vqY) stuff could be considered pretty progressive.  But again, not really metal.  
p1595
aVCame here to mention I Am Abomination, they're top notch!
p1596
aV[Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vluBFWv4mE) never use harsh vocals but still sound heavy as fuck.
p1597
aVOh yeah, them and Thank You Scientist are number one and two on bands I *have* to check out.  
p1598
aV[Never?](http://youtu.be/RelR85j09XY?t=1m29s)
p1599
aVOk, *almost* never.
p1600
aVCheck out Distorted Harmony! I recommend anything they've released, but [Children of Red](http://youtu.be/flcB5hcg484?t=7m9s) may be more of what you're looking for
p1601
aVSecond this!
p1602
aVDistorted Harmony are bosses!
p1603
aVI'd also add [Jolly - Firewell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePF-CcATGLA) into the mix. 
p1604
aVAlready got them! Love those guys. 
p1605
aVThe lack of Leprous in this thread is baffling(okay, one mention, but seriously), but if you're looking for really heavy music with Almost all clean vocals, you can't go wrong with them.\u000a\u000a[Leprous - Forced Entry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxAIsZldltA)\u000a\u000a[Leprous - Coal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oO2rfXgCGY)\u000a\u000a[Leprous - The Valley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14h8NVpBA4o)\u000a\u000aThat and they have a new album coming out soon!\u000a
p1606
aVThe new contortionist album has a good mix of both but it seems to lean more towards clean vocals for most tunes. It's also just really beautiful. It's called "language"
p1607
aVSeconded. Language I isn't traditionally heavy, but there is totally a degree of heaviness there. The vocals are top.
p1608
aVAs a fan of [Last Chance To Reason](http://youtu.be/rPE-OeriXTQ), I was pleasantly surprised when I heard Language. Michael Lessard is fantastic.
p1609
aV[Pallbearer](http://youtu.be/4ArNlI5PZSs) is pretty fucking heavy. Not prog though. 
p1610
aVI would say Tesseract. Also, certain Periphery songs fall into the category of "heavy and mostly clean singing"
p1611
aV[Haken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NdXqroDz9c#t=140) can get pretty heavy. 
p1612
aVArguably Voivod, especially Nothingface, Angel Rat and The Outer Limits. The other albums are heavier still but also contain less prog.
p1613
aVI wouldn't say they got less prog, The Outer Limits has Jack Luminous on it, which was a pretty big deal for them.
p1614
aVOk, a lot of bands have already been covered, but I think I have a few new ones...\u000a\u000a[Diablo Swing Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYFU6SOrVuk)\u000a\u000a[Fair to Midland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyCqbCvYDm8)\u000a\u000a[The Kindred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APFgMS0McbY)\u000a\u000a[Voyager](https://voyager.bandcamp.com/track/hyperventilating)\u000a\u000a[Navigators](https://navigator-nc.bandcamp.com/track/the-thaw)\u000a\u000a[Children of Nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my97ucAwSko)\u000a\u000aI prefer clean vocals as well, but there a few bands where I give the vocals a pass because the instrumentals are so good:\u000a[Wings Denied](https://wingsdenied.bandcamp.com/track/maiden-feat-michael-rumple)\u000a\u000a[The Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7y1ZYFODw)\u000a
p1615
aVYes. Children of Nova. 
p1616
aVBut Wings Denied is mostly clean.
p1617
aVI'm thinking Deftones. Specifically Diamond Eyes. There is screaming but I'd say the cleans are far more prevalent.
p1618
aVIntervals is clean and fast as shit. Protest the Hero uses mostly cleans. Animals as Leaders is entirely instrumental.
p1619
aV[Arcturus](http://youtu.be/1TbArXpg_sk)\u000a\u000a[Ark](http://youtu.be/N9zFICL-Lng)\u000a\u000a[Beyond Twilight](http://youtu.be/uQlPz2yizX8)\u000a\u000a[Evergrey](http://youtu.be/hT4zsQVbO2A)\u000a\u000a[Fair To Midland](http://youtu.be/vyCqbCvYDm8)\u000a\u000a[Leprous](http://youtu.be/fi8NyQvhCUc)\u000a\u000a[Riverside](http://youtu.be/KfXL2aOu9ME)\u000a\u000a[Symphony X](http://youtu.be/DbTSLVx7dgE)\u000a\u000a[Three](http://youtu.be/rvBBPnHA9Bs)
p1620
aVConfessor 
p1621
aVthe downside isssss
p1622
aVDelain - The Human Contradiction has some of the heaviest riffs I've heard in a long time, almost entirely clean vocals.
p1623
aVArctic Sleep has a couple of heavy ish tracks, such as Destroy the Urn.
p1624
aVSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN, OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH
p1625
aVThey actually kind of blew me away with how heavy they were. Didn't really expect it.
p1626
aVI Am Abomination.
p1627
aVNot a band typically mentioned on here, but you could check out Galneryus. Japanese symphonic metal band, but they sing in English. Their original vocalist is almost operatic.\u000a\u000aCheck out the albums Beyond the End of Despair or Reincarnation. \u000a\u000aOther good songs include Silent Revelation and Destiny (with their new vocalist) 
p1628
aVInteresting. Will check them out. 
p1629
aVnow that i'm on my computer, i can link some songs\u000a\u000aShriek of the Vengeance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KB3iHlgIsc#t=135\u000a\u000aBlast of Hell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKkPbxA9po#t=453\u000a\u000aSilent Revelation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg5DtI0AWXA#t=75\u000a\u000aEhh the start times all got thrown off but you get the idea\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p1630
aVBlast of Hell definitely fits this bill.
p1631
aVYeah blast of hell is a great heavy song. Another good one from that album is The Flag of Reincarnation. But you can't just jump to that song, the build up to it throughout the album makes it so much better. 
p1632
aVTotally agree!
p1633
aVSkyharbor's 2nd album
p1634
aVI'm just going to go through my youtube list for this stuff and load you up with my favorite heavy-ish clean vocal songs.  Some of these aren't exactly like Porcupine Tree, but they are definitely worth a listen.\u000a\u000a[Redemption - Love Kills Us All/Life In One Day](http://youtu.be/SyQs8lEkZ-c)\u000a\u000a[Arjen Lucasson's Star One - Digital Rain](http://youtu.be/91PkQccZqjE) *(Honestly, Arjen is pretty prolific with weird, progressive, clean vocal stuff.  He's big on ensemble projects with space themes.)*\u000a\u000a[I Am Giant - Sillouette](http://youtu.be/rGIdHZPd-Ko)\u000a\u000a[Being - Arcane Academic](http://youtu.be/rdmQWAdWuHs)\u000a\u000a[Seiges Even - Tidal](http://youtu.be/VKHTvcEQwkU)\u000a\u000a[Threshold - Ashes](http://youtu.be/UfkyRlL06hM)\u000a\u000a[Poverty's No Crime - Open Your Eyes](http://youtu.be/oyEhNFgvBRI)\u000a\u000a[Arena - Burning Down](http://youtu.be/MsD5m6pKKPg)\u000a\u000a[Leverage - Wolf and the Moon](http://youtu.be/03ePbjRMjsk)\u000a\u000a[Anubis Gate - Hold Back Tomorrow](http://youtu.be/pF6UcqP-2z4)\u000a\u000a[Circles - Act III](http://youtu.be/R0Ly2xTJY1g)\u000a\u000a[Breaking Orbit - Silence Seekers](http://youtu.be/xfkrRmhu9WY)\u000a\u000a[Amplifier - White Horses at Sea](http://youtu.be/yVYzhime2B4)\u000a\u000a[Socionic - Epiphany](http://youtu.be/A1XngYPEH3Y)\u000a\u000a.\u000a\u000aAnd just a couple that are a LITTLE left field of your request, but are heavy-ish with clean vocals:\u000a\u000a[Avatarium - Moonhorse](http://youtu.be/GWuGTYiQs8U)\u000a\u000a[The Birthday Massacre - In the Dark](http://youtu.be/tLOfluH8mgQ)\u000a\u000a
p1635
aVDisperse is probably the heaviest/most dense band that I can think of that dont scream and I haven't seen in this thread yet. The intro to ["AUM"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7R2InREyxk) devolves into an incredibly heavy breakdown, and it's absolutely delicious.
p1636
aVIn addition to all the other great bands listed here (I particularly like The Devin Townsend Project, Soen, and Madder Mortem) I'm also a big fan of the Galahad Suite by Anton Johansson.  A fun concept album with a lot of great songs.  It feels really old-school.
p1637

p1638
aVWhile it may not quite be "progressive metal" and probably considered quite mainstream, I'm a huge fan of Avenged Sevenfold (post- City of Evil). Worth a listen if you're not familiar with their work.
p1639
aVDo [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhSVwcRcMIk) vocals count? Animals As Leaders has none.
p1640
aVHe specifically asked for heavy bands WITH clean vocals. It's hard for me to follow your logic of suggesting AAL. What the fuck man...
p1641
aVSome people see, "with clean vox" and understand, "without harsh vox." 
p1642
aV[deleted]

aVPersephone- The Spiritual Migration
p1644
aVWhat part of "almost entirely clean vocals" didn't you understand?
p1645
aVYet you didn't say anything to the person who mentioned The Ocean in this thread.
p1646
aVNo, I hadn't seen that, and now I can't be bothered. Regardless, the fact that someone else suggested a band that doesn't fit the description doesn't make it any more sensible. 
p1647
aV[deleted]
p1648
aVcheck out The Lotus Effect by Sun Caged
p1649
aVDisillusion (Gloria, their 2nd album) - has been one of my favorite prog metal bands for years, one of the heaviest bands I know, regardless of vocals. The vocals aren't always completely clean but its definitely not screaming or growling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSP_s5-bQdk\u000a\u000aAnd Corelia has an amazing clean singer, I can't wait for their new album https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwIW9qzWI5o
p1650
aVI don't even mind a bit of screaming, it's mostly the death metal growling (Opeth) that bothers me.

aVIntervals - A Voice Within.
p1659
aVEY. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_vdW1TiFWE
p1660
aVCan I suggest I Am Abomination? They list themselves as Progressive Post Hardcore, and I completely agree. No harsh vocals, lots of great riffs and amazing solos. This is the band to listen to if you want crazy solos. [Transformation - I Am Abomination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m_WfqqRv2M)
p1661
aVHaha I posted about this band yesterday, but Desultor. They are not a prog band by any means, but it sounds like you'll like them. Clean Vocals over really fast Death Metal. Awesome band. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st0WoXijb8s
p1662
aVTyr's "Ragnarok" is one of my favorite go-to heavy-and-clean albums. Novembre has a lot of beautiful stuff with a mixture of *gorgeous* cleans and screams, though "Arte Novecento" is entirely clean and "Materia" is largely clean \u2013 I highly recommend them. Aside from that, I will back the already-mentioned Arcane, Haken, and Leprous.
p1663
aVHaken - listen to "The Cockroach King" from the "The Mountain" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjrcXCAeNe4) album. Once they have you gripped sweetly by the balls, listen to the album in it's entirety and then listen to "Visons" by them.
p1664
aVI was just going to post a song by Scientic, because they deserve it and are fucking awesome!\u000aI'd say they are a mix of thrash metal with lots of progressive and a bit of power metal.\u000a\u000a[Scientic - Dialectic Liberty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey7Ef_5hzyc)\u000a\u000aTheir first album is up for streaming too\u000a\u000a[Scientic - Empire of the Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryGzXBeuo3o)

asVRush - Caravan
p1666
(lp1667
VThey did a really good job of modernizing their sound on this album.
p1668
aVI remember hearing this for the first time and thinking "damn, the masters [Rush] are learning from the students [specifically Dream Theater]"! The whole album definitely has some of Rush's heaviest stuff.
p1669
aVRush has been one of my favorite bands since I started liking music, and I never really considered them Prog Metal.  This song I can agree with, but I always see them classified as prog metal.  Do you think they really fit into that label?
p1670
aVThey're kinda prog proto-metal occasionally, in the same way that Led Zeppelin is sometimes considered proto-metal.  At the very least they're heavily influential on early prog metal bands.
p1671
aVI heard this live pre-release as an encore track on the Time Machine tour... It was my first concert.\u000a\u000aGreat stuff.

p1673
(lp1674
VThis was the first song by Tool I've ever heard! Needless to say I was hooked right away. 
p1675
aVWas gonna say the same, aenima is my favorite record in the whole universe :D
p1676
aVIt was actually the first music video I ever saw. When I was about 6 or so, it was on a TV in some electronics store. Blew my mind when I got into tool YEARS later and watched the video again.
p1677
aVWHERE IS IT GUYS?!?? THE ALBUM. GIVE. US. THE. ALBUM. ^I ^want ^it ^so ^bad ^:(
p1678
aVJENNY DEATH WHE- shit, sorry, wrong thread. 
p1679
aVI've been on a huge, HUGE Tool kick as of late. Like my process has been listen to Undertow, then Ænima, then Lateralus, then 10,000 Days. Then repeat process. 
p1680
aVYour should start with Opiate and mix Salival in as well, their entire catalogue is gold, Maynard's Dick included

aVYou and everyone else. We need more rock and roll!

aVI don't mean to sound old but when and why did the word 'drop' replace the word 'release'?
p1687
aVWell, English isn't my first language and it was the first thing that popped into my head.
p1688
aVThis brings me back. MTV wouldn't/couldn't say or type stinkfist. It was listed at track #1.
p1689
aVComing at you from 12 hours in the future. Still hasn't been released.

p1694
aVAenema is, to me, their apogee.
p1695
aVthis is probably the only song by tool i cannot take seriously, because its about anal fisting.
p1696
aVIs it? Are you sure the meaning is only surface deep? I bet you think strippers really like you too. 
p1697
aV[I guess I was half right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinkfist), but my basis has always been in regards to the lyrics:\u000a\u000aFinger deep within the borderline.\u000a\u000aShow me that you love me and that we belong together.\u000a\u000aRelax, turn around and take my hand.\u000a\u000a...\u000a\u000a\u000aBlend and balance\u000a\u000aPain and comfort\u000a\u000aDeep within you\u000a\u000aTill you will not want me any other way\u000a\u000a...\u000a\u000aElbow deep inside the borderline.\u000a\u000aShow me that you love me and that we belong together.\u000a\u000aShoulder deep within the borderline.\u000a\u000aRelax.

aV&gt;sort of "melodeath The Chariot"  \u000a\u000aYou're not that far off honestly. They do have a mathcore-hardcore sound that's mixed with black and melodic death.

p1705
(lp1706
VI love the Nil Recurring/Blank Planet pair. The way the songs overlap and meld, the re-configured choruses and motifs. It's very smart. They play all the songs from both on the 'Anaesthetize' live album- which is well worth the time.
p1707
aVOne of my favorite percussion performances of the decade.  Stunning technique and execution. 
p1708
aVProbably my favourite drummer of all time :) I love the fills in this segment (particularly the finger rub on the drum skin @ 6:47) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nAA_QXBPY#t=397

p1719
aVFor the albums I've actually listened to, my recommendations are:\u000a\u000a* The Joy of Motion - Physical Education, Kascade, Mind-Spun\u000a\u000a* Clear EP - Feed the Ground, Pale Aura (sorry, I kinda hate the Clear EP but these two are the most palatable IMO)\u000a\u000a* Language - Language I, Thrive\u000a\u000a* Mastodon - Once More Round the Sun, Chimes at Midnight, Halloween\u000a\u000a* Monuments - I, The Destroyer, Horcrux, Jinn\u000a\u000aI obviously lack several.
p1720
aVAAL: Physical Education, Ka$cade, Another Year\u000a\u000aAtmospheres: Voices, Beyond the Visible, ?\u000a\u000aClement Bélio: Impostors, Keirô no Hi, Think Thank\u000a\u000aCloudkicker Little Histories: Sky Guide, Digital Lightning, Hassan (Why is it Buttkicker? haha)\u000a\u000aCloudkicker Live: Subsume 1, Dysphoria, Push it way up!\u000a\u000aContortionist: Language I, Language II, Thrive\u000a\u000aDestiny Potato: Indifferent, Love Song, Addict\u000a\u000aFallujah: Sapphire, Levitation, Startlit Path\u000a\u000aThe Helix Nebula: Temple, Time Piece, Sea of Suns\u000a\u000aMiroist: The closing of your eye, 29%, Lumen suum reiecta\u000a\u000aPeriphery: Pale Aura, Zero, Extraneous\u000a\u000aSkyharbor: Allure, Evolution, The Constant

p1723
aVThanks! I'll check these out.
p1724
aVI'd add The Return South's self titled, which came out lat year. Every track is worth checking out, the whole album is only 34 minutes total, and it's free on BandCamp. My favorite is the Mountains personally, but every song is fantastic.

VAutotheism: the story of Michael Keene.
p1739
aVLol
p1740
aVI read the wiki for it and this stood out to me:\u000a&gt;Keene has stated in interviews that the name "Autotheism" derives from "auto" meaning self and "theism" meaning belief in God or gods, hence autotheism means "believing in one's self", or "being your own God"\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a*"being your own God"*
p1741
aVGood news! Michael Keene has been busy producing The Zenith Passage's new album but says The Faceless will have their record done soon. You can read the article [here](http://www.metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/michael-keene-says-the-faceless-new-record-is-almost-done).
p1742
aVSeeing them with BTBAM was the best moment of my life. I got a guitar pick from keene!
p1743
aVLove this album, hope they can get a lineup stable enough for a new one
p1744
aVI would honestly be okay with a Michael Keene solo album. Especially with his voice.
p1745
aVI'm still very disappointed that they didn't play this when I saw them at Summer Slaughter. Oh well, I can forgive anything when I hear that solo at the end of Movement II... absolutely mindblowing and beautiful.

asVRush - By-Tor And The Snow Dog
p1747

Vgreat song, quite progressive, though i'm not sure i'd consider it metal.\u000a\u000athe part where the bass &amp; guitar sound like two battling animals is amazing!

p1752
aVHot damn that was intense. Really, really like their sound. The music video was a bit cheesy for my tastes but the music is spot the fuck on!
p1753
aVThese guys open up for like every prog metal band that comes to Arizona and I cannot stand them. The vocalist uses an effect to do his growls. 
p1754
asVÆnimus - "Masterpiece" (playthrough)
p1755
(lp1756
VI can't believe I've never heard of these guys before. I'd place them somewhere right in between The Faceless and Beyond Creation. Really great stuff if you like tech death. 
p1757
aVI had heard of these guys before buy just picked up their album last week. Highly enjoying my purchase! One of the guitarists, Miles Dimitri Baker, has another project named Interloper. Enjoy!\u000a\u000a[A Red Letter Day Playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_3zvPpPa88)\u000a\u000aHe also just joined Rings of Saturn!
p1758
aVThanks a lot! That dude is crazy good.  How does he come up with this stuff? He somehow makes shred sound very tasteful 
p1759
aVThe huge difference in style from Interloper to Aenimus is crazy to me. I would dare say it's a result of his training in classical and music theory. This is from his About section on the official Aenimus site: \u000a\u000a&gt; I took music theory lessons, as well as guitar lessons (electric &amp; classical). Since then I have loved writing music as well as practicing guitar to get as good as I can be, I never feel like I will be there, but I am sure no one does. My favorite types of music are Classical and Progressive Metal.
p1760
aVTheir guitarists always seemed pretty talented, especially the 2nd lead they brought in. But they would always spam their facebook page with unimportant bullshit and I sort of blacklisted them. Can't say it was a mature decision, but neither was posting about beef curtains every second week.

p1768

V[For All We Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UZqRk0MVlI) has a PoS vibe to it.\u000a\u000aIt features Kristoffer Gildenlöw on bass and Léo Margarit on drums from PoS and Daniel features on a few tracks.
p1770
aVOh awesome, thanks!
p1771
aVNot sure how new you're wanting, but I'll start with a few bands that come a little close in style: [Wolverine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxV0mrPCSVo) and [Vangough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nSIlve64jw). Vangough's vocalist in particular has a pretty diverse range of vocal styles which reminds me of Daniel at times.\u000a\u000aAnd then there's [Wastefall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEqh9JktyjA), who I'm not entirely convinced aren't just Pain of Salvation playing an elaborate joke...\u000a
p1772
aVAwesome, I haven't heard any of them. I'll get on that.
p1773
aVI was also going to say Wolverine so definitely check them out.
p1774
aV[Kingcrow](http://youtu.be/d4sNpc-fvPw) toured with PoS here in the U.S. back in 2013, and they definitely carry an influence. [Another example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOXKU8GpW_g). Their last 2 (*Phlegethon* and *In Crescendo*) are the only albums I've gone through at this point, but I love em!
p1775
aVLeprous, for sure.  They're kinda floating between PoS, Devin Townsend, and Ihsahn.\u000a\u000aHere's a random selection:\u000a\u000a[Forced Entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxAIsZldltA)\u000a\u000a[Dare You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCWkn6bExUg)\u000a\u000a[Echo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQYFftPr0b0)\u000a\u000a[Chronic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OXSmM2zBwU)\u000a\u000a[Painful Detour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gENgdGTU5Jo)

They are more in the direction of Black Metal but I would rate Kvohst (the singer) almost as high as Gildenlöw. He does vocals for plenty of bands, most of which are pretty good (e.g. [Hexvessel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kMiGW9Qdw0)).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VI saw the sidebar image last night, listened to both EPs, and purchased them immediately. I can hardly comprehend that this guy creates music this incredible in his bedroom! Instant Plini fan here. 
p1791
aVHis stuff is really amazing and he does a lot of guest solos for other bands.  I would love to see a cloudkicker/plini collaboration album.  
p1792
aVFuck me my mind might implode. 
p1793
aVCloudkicker, Plini, Sithu Aye, David Maxim Micic, and Jakub \u017bytecki
p1794
aVYeah he's one of the only instrumentalists I like\u000a\u000aCloudkicker and Sithu Aye make nice fun music but I can't stand it sometimes because they're too sterile and don't really flow like Plini's tracks
p1795
aVSithu Aye has worked a lot with Plini and honestly, Since I've found Sithu Aye I really prefer his work more, just more dynamic. Both are huge inspirations and I would recommend viewing Sithu Aye, Chon, Animals as leaders and guthrie Govan. I absolutely can't wait for Plini he is soo talented :)
p1796
aVGood recs! I've been listening to AAL for a few years now, and just came across Chon a week ago. But I'll give Sithu Aye a shot!

aVBTBAM has been added to this subreddit's 'Hall of Fame'. You can find their article [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/wiki/halloffame/btbam), including a list of user-voted songs!\u000a\u000aThis should give you a good overview!
p1814
aVCOLORS.
p1815
aVEveryone's gonna say Colors, and that's okay, because it's an awesome album. Personally, though, I got way more into Alaska. All Bodies, Roboturner and Selkies are my absolute favorite BTBAM songs.
p1816
aVThe Parallax II: Future Sequence is the one that really got me into BTBAM.
p1817
aVALASKA
p1818
aVAlaska is what got me into them
p1819
aVCame here to say this! OP, start with Alaska. Then probably Colors or ParII. Then go back and listen to how intricate Alaska is really is, and they've stuck true to their roots. 
p1820
aVShit, started to fanboy. 
p1821
aVThe bassist to btbam is in another band called trioscapes. They're amazing check them out too.
p1822
aVwhat /u/NMEMine said.  \u000a  \u000aI'd say most people are going to say Colors and move towards the future. I found everything pre-Colors unstructured and difficult to get into.  \u000a  \u000aedit: also check out another also band called [Black Crown Initiate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhY8-iJnZ-M). They have some BTBAM vibes going on but do their own thing.
p1823
aV&gt; I found everything pre-Colors unstructured and difficult to get into.\u000a\u000aEven Alaska?  I loved that album.
p1824
aVI like Selkies and that's about it. Everything Colors and beyond, like every song on those albums, I found to be enjoyable. And I find it rare to enjoy full albums.
p1825
aVI think Alaska is the most coherent and structured album by them. Every songs flows well.  I love all their  albums, but Alaska is my favorite. 
p1826
aVBlack Crown Initiate are so good. 
p1827
aVA number of the links in the Hall could use some updating. Or at least the first few I clicked on.
p1828
aVnot my area of the sub, but I'm sure if you sent some links or items that needed to be updated to the modmail, the other mods would probably take care of it fairly quickly.
p1829
aVThis makes me happy that someone mentioned that band here. Black crown is so awesome and their new album is dope. BTBAM is like brie cheese of metal in my opinion.
p1830
aVI went a weird way of Future Sequence, Colors, The Silent Circus, Alaska, then The Great Misdirect.\u000a\u000aEverything other than their self titled is great. They started being prog with colors, though their earlier work has a lot prog elements.\u000a\u000aFuture Sequence or Colors is a great place to start. Mordecai and Selkies are great singles that need listening. Almost all of the rest of their material is great also. BTBAM is a bit of an acquired taste, so I would recommend actively listening. Don't just use it as background music, listen and read along to the lyrics or something.\u000a\u000aAlso, I like to use [sputnikmusic](http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Between-the-Buried-and-Me/617/) to figure out where to start listening to a new band. A 3.0 is good, a 3.5 is better, and a 4.0+ is great. The related artists is useful too.  
p1831
aVAs amazing as Colors is, I feel there isn't enough love for Future Sequence in this thread. Maybe because is still relatively new and people are hesitant to give it the credit it deserves.
p1832
aVyes. that is all.
p1833
aVI've got to echo the "Colors" suggestion.  A few years ago I was stuck in the computer lab at school working on a project all night and put on Colors on a whim and it changed my life.  After 10 minutes or so I just stopped working altogether and just sat and listened all the way through.  That night got me into prog metal.
p1834
aValaska
p1835
aVI love all their records, but actually started with *Alaska* and I honestly believe it's a better starting place than *Colors*.
p1836
aVColors and onward of course, but check out All Bodies and Selkies from Alaska, although the album as a whole is a bit of a mess in my opinion. Also The Great Misdirect is a favourite of mine.
p1837
aVThere are more great songs on Alaska than just those 2. What about The Primer, Walaska, and Backwards Marathon?
p1838
aVAh yes, The Primer is a good one. But honestly, I don't really care for the rest
p1839
aVThe title track, Alaska?! 
p1840
aVEverything they have is so good. The only "bad record" there put out is The Great Misdirect. That's only because it was the follow up to Colors and everybody thinks that is the greatest record they ever did at the time. \u000a\u000aStart with colors then go to the beginning and listen on. 
p1841
aVI feel like I am opposite of all the BTBAM fans. My two favourite albums are The Great Misdirect and Parallax II: Future Sequence.\u000a\u000aColors is a great album, but not my favourite!
p1842
aVYeah, The Great Misdirect isn't a bad record at all, even considering it's placement in their discography. In fact it's what solidified me as a diehard BTBAM fan. I love Colors (obviously haha) but it was a complete departure from this less structured sound people are talking about here, which I found a bit difficult to get into. Every song on that record is fun and unique and offers an experience only BTBAM can give.\u000a\u000aPersonally though, i feel Parallax 1 &amp; 2 can't be beat. Those dual albums create one huge masterpiece. 
p1843
aVI just kind of find The Great Misdirect kind of boring with exception of "Fossil Genera" and "Swim To The Moon"
p1844
aVColors is their best by far. 
p1845
aVThe Parallax II: Future Sequence is the most accessible album for someone who doesn't already have a taste for Prog-Metal and Colors is better for someone who's already got Prog-Blood. Future Sequence is the better album in my opinion but if you start on Colors in order to train your brain to allow BTBAM to fuck it before listening to Parallax it will make Parallax that much better.

aVKlone seem to be taking a more progressive route with their new album, but there's plenty of their old stuff that's been posted here if you haven't heard of them before.  The new album is being crowdsourced, and is 86% funded so far with 20 or so days to go.  Thought someone here might be interested :)
p1864
aVNever heard of these guys before but I like post-metal and these guys remind me a bit of Russian Circles/The Ocean.  Is this indicative of the rest of their library?
p1865
aVNot really, they've been more groove-metal traditionally, but have some quite proggy influences (You might like their Eye of Needle EP), and seem to be heading more towards that style at the moment.  Great drummer too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCr8DWYQzP8 :)

p1870
aVThe vocals need some serious work that I don't think even better mastering could fix. \u000a\u000aThe riffs were a little on a generic side.\u000a\u000aNot exactly positive things, but maybe this kind of feedback can help you improve. \u000a\u000aKeep it up! And good luck!
p1871
aVThanks for the feedback regardless! Turns out doing screams isn't that easy \U0001f602 tough when no one in our area really does this stuff so it's hard to find advice / proper recording equipment. 
p1872
aVFor a first song it's definitely not terrible. Quality is decent for a first song. \u000a\u000aHowever, just about everything about it is generic as fuck. Band name, song name, riffs, lyrics, breakdowns. \u000a\u000aBeing generic isn't bad, you just have to be interesting while doing it. Potential is there. You just have to do your own thing, man.
p1873
aVI appreciate the feedback! It's all our first time writing anything so generic is lack of our own style for sure. It'll come with time. 
p1874
asVNovallo - Tides (these guys are way too underrated)
p1875
(lp1876
VI want to like this a lot, but the guitar is edited to death. At this point it's not even robotic sounding, it's just all pick attack. I enjoy clean production as much as the next guy but I've never heard anyone take it this far. Otherwise the composition and everything else is great. 
p1877
aVThe new album will be...interesting. The guitarist did a lot of experimenting using his AxFX to create non-guitar sounds. The teasers sound like electronic music. 
p1878
aVThat does seem interesting. I don't hate the idea, and I think it could be done really well. I guess the execution is what will determine whether i like it or hate it. The current stuff really reminds me of programmed guitar, like Anup Sastry's material, and given the context it just doesn't sit right with me. I'll definitely give the new album a shot, whenever that comes out. 
p1879
aVTheir new single is *less* edited than their first EP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz70wI49ExQ\u000a\u000aI'm actually rather impressed with their editing skills though. It takes some good Pro Tools skills to edit things that tight.
p1880
aVWoah.

p1884
aVoh this is awkward. I said they disbanded exactly because I can't get their facebook page to work, I thought they deleted it. I'm redirected to the facebook homepage. I'm from Portugal, that might have something to do with it.\u000a\u000aIn that case, great!

p1893
aVSame! I'm not a fan at all but it's hard to dislike the instrumental parts, especially when Marco Minnemann and Guthrie Govan are a part of it.
p1894
aVThat's probably a big contributor for me, the album feels far more vibrant than a lot of his other stuff for me.
p1895
aVYeah, I noticed this just a few minutes ago. I'm not going to download it though, mostly because I like to buy the albums, and also because I don't mind waiting. I imagine I'll also get to see them play some of the songs live when the come to Boston in May :).

He was really engaging, very present- not like some "rockstars" who act like they couldn't care less about who they're talking to. Obviously we talked guitar, song writing, production, stuff like that. I've been playing for 17 years, and I think I learned more from him in that hour than I had in the few years prior to that. He also asked where they could find good pizza. I told them right next door at Yia Yia's. They were not disappoint. The Safety Fire was there too, so I met both Dez and Jo. 10/10 would hang again.

aVI met James Labrie on the Progressive Nation 2009 tour. My dad and I were running late (Scale the Summit was the first of the opening acts and we missed almost all of it, except the last song they played), but as we're about to walk through the front doors of the Hard Rock Hotel I see James Labrie walking through them. I start patting my dad on the shoulder just saying, "Dad, it's James Labrie! It's James Labrie!" (I was 16 at the time, so I was extremely excited lol) We went up to him, saying "hi" and shaking his hand, pretty much star struck though. Whenever my dad goes to a concert he brings some CDs with him in the hopes of meeting one of the members and getting them signed. It definitely paid off this time as I brought my own Awake album with me and I think my dad brought SFAM P2. So I got Labrie to sign my copy of [Awake.](http://i.imgur.com/NETLs7F.jpg) Unfortunately two other guys came up out of nowhere and started talking to him, interrupting us. So my dad and I, not wanting to bug him anymore, just thanked him for his time and made our way to concert. I really wish I could've talked to him a bit more, but meeting him when it was my first/only time so far seeing DT was plenty for me.
p1977
aVMy favorite part of shows is meeting the band members.\u000a\u000aI bumped into Lee from Born of Osiris in Chicago occasionally whenever djent bands play shows. I think I saw him at TesseracT, The Contortionist, and VoM shows. I bumped into him at McDonald's in Milwaukee.\u000a\u000aI randomly met Rody Walker from Protest The Hero outside when BTBAM and deafheaven were playing in Milwaukee as PTH were playing the next day. We talked again couple of days later at the IL show. Very friendly person.\u000a\u000aThe Contortionist are great dudes and they always recognize me at the shows. Their merch guy is the VIP tbh.

aVI ran into Dusty Waring of BTBAM a few hours before a show outside of Boston, just a few blocks away from the venue. I don't know if that really counts, especially since he had exchanged emails with my girlfriend and we had planned to meet. I got to hang out with Blake Richardson later after the show, which was awesome. They were both super cool.\u000a\u000aThat night, my girlfriend and I went to a hotel nearby to sleep before we had to travel again, and when we went to the breakfast area the next morning, we ended up sitting next to Michael Keene of The Faceless. We chatted him up a bit, and it turned out to be pretty awesome.\u000a\u000aOn an unrelated note, and a relatively un-proggy one, a friend of mine once started wandering around a local town where Kvelertak were playing in hopes of finding the band lost in a coffee shop somewhere. Lo and behold, they found Kvelertak chattering away in Norwegian in a coffee shop.

p2000
aVI think the lack of chapman stick played a role in that. sheehan is a sick bassist. but the song was written with a chapman stick and  llevins playing really kept the pace of the song. He basically plays rhythm guitar and bass at the same time.

aVEverything seems sloppy compared to that.
p2002
aVCrap, Levin is such a monster.. blah. I wish they would play together again.
p2003
aVYeah there's no comparison. The switch of petrucci to macalpine shows you how ridiculous petrucci really is. Sure, there's dudes with chops who can cover his shit, but it's never the same, or barely even close.  Nailing this shit live is so much harder than just being able to play the parts.

aVI'm sorry, but am I the only one here who doesn't find Sheehan particularly interesting? \u000a\u000aI'm in no way denying his capability because he will blow me out of a goddamn river, but I've never really cared for him. I feel like he's constantly playing a game of "I can do that too!" with the guitarists he's playing with instead of bringing forward his own interesting grooves or bass lines.\u000a\u000aIf I'm absolutely wrong, could someone give me some better Sheehan examples?
p2013
aVDespite Portnoy's issues, this line up is pretty freaking outstanding. 
p2014
aVPortnoy's issues?
p2015
aVTechnically, he's a great drummer, so I guess I should have just spoken in regards to the technical prowess of that lineup, which is truly sick. Mike has left a bad taste in my mouth over the years and  no one wants to play with the guy because he's a micromanaging headcase.  
p2016
aVYou should listen to Adrenaline Mob (1st album), Transatlantic, Flying Colors and The Winery Dogs with him, they all have recent albums with him
p2017
aVyou know he's the only one from Liquid Tension Experiment in that video? everyone else is covering. \u000a\u000aAlso he's playing very well with Billy Sheehan here and in their band The Winery Dogs. 
p2018
aVYeah, it was Portnoy, Petrucci, Levin, and Rudess (prior to him joining DT with the departure of Sherinian). I was actually one of the original members on Portnoy's forum back when it opened in the FII days.  I had a front-row seat watching the guy make one bad decision after another - from the entire Myung lyrics debate, the "What would you say, if I walked up away?" fan-slamming lyric fiasco, to the DT breakup, to the bullshit tweet pic of "all of his riches", to the Avenge Sevenfold fiasco, and more.  I'm glad the Winery Dogs things is working out for him.  I stopped following his projects a few years ago.  He's a talented drummer, he just takes shit way to personally and he's WAY to controlling.  
p2019
aVCould you summarize these fiascos? I didn't realize there was a debate around John Myung's (lack of?) lyrics, I didn't see the tweet pic of his riches, and I have no idea what happened between Portnoy and Avenged Sevenfold. 
p2020
aVIt wasn't between Portnoy and AX7. When the Rev died and Portnoy chose to fill in for the balance of the AX7 tour DT was on a break. AX7 ends and Portnoy has been touring but the rest of the band is rested and ready to go back to work. Portnoy demands a break/puts his foot down/whatever, and the band moves on. DT gets new drummer. 
p2021
aVSure... It's been a crazy trip.  First of all, Myung wrote a bunch of lyrics in DT's early days.  Most fans consider these to be the best of the band's history (Learning to Live was likely his pinnacle piece).  Mike then places a moratorium on John's lyrics because he felt he needed to micro-manage them in order to fit the band's playing style, despite the outcry from fans that asked for WAY more Myung lyrics.  "What Would you say" lyrics come from the song "Never Enough", which was written about a particular MP.com user who complained about Mike posting a link to a sound clip from his extensive personal archive.  I don't know what happened to Mike that day, but he took it so personally he wrote a song about it.  The thing is, there was always a core group of people who complained about everything.  99% of us blew them off and they typically faded into the woodwork.. but when Mike writes a song about it, he offended his direct fan base.  We knew he wasn't talking about everyone, but still... is it necessary to draw attention to the minute percentage of haters??  No.   After the break up with DT, there was certainly a bunch of Portnoy hate cast upon the internet.  Mike's response?  Post a picture of him standing in from of his house with all of his cars and riches talking about how his problems were better than the common man.  It wasn't a terrible thing to do, but in the context with how things were going and the timing of it, a PR disaster. The Avenge story was after he was touring with them, he was ready to head into the studio and the guys from the band were like "Uuuh, no... it was just a tour thing".  The A7 guys repeatedly said they told him it was strictly a tour thing, but apparently he thought he worked himself into a permanent spot.  Awkward pony.  Perhaps it wasn't made clear, but it was yet another thing on the trail of tears.  It was just one awkward situation and bad choice after another... I, admittedly was checked out after the "What would you say" fiasco.  I'm doing a poor job of conveying how poorly these situations were handled in the Portnoy camp, but trust me, it drove a HUGE divide in long-time communities and inside the fan base.  It was the strangest, most bizarre band issue I've ever witnessed first hand.

aV&gt; no one wants to play with the guy because he's a micromanaging headcase.\u000a\u000aElaborate? He's been constantly playing with different people since he left DT...
p2025
aVIt goes all the way back to DT.  He had is hand wrapped around everything.  Not letting any of the other band members grow, never bringing in an outside Producer, involved with every aspect of the video stuff he did including the editing, and post-production.  He did it all.  Some people argued that DT was his "brand" and that he was a "hard worker", but this was exposed when the guys from A7 started feeling it - which was reported (...is admittedly speculation) why they parted ways after the tour.  And also why he has a hard time putting together a "full time" primary band.  Maybe the Winery Dogs can be that for him.

asVMisery Signals - Two Solitudes. IMO Absent Light was one of the most criminally underrated albums of 2013.
p2035
(lp2036
VOstensibly because few in the prog community considered Misery Signals prog up until this album. Seriously though, few bands could go on a five year hiatus, lose half their band members, and still release an album of this caliber.

aVAbsolutely. This album was chilling.

aVFuck Yeah! These guys have definitely evolved into a more proggy sound.
p2039
aVEvery time 'best drumming in metal' discussions I drop Branden Morgan's name. He absolutely carries this album; the drums are so massive in the mix that it's like the rest of the band realized it as he was throwing down and sat there going 'fuuuuuck'.
p2040
aVI find he overplays pretty often. Never been a huge fan of his
p2041
aVMan, I really disagree. I think he does a fantastic job of knowing when to play for the song, and when the song needs him to come out. And his more 'in your face' parts are phrased well, it's not just some variation of RLRLBB RLRLBB RLBB down the toms (aka the Mike Portnoy special) 
p2042
aVI should clarify, I don't think of him as a bad drummer in any way and as a drummer I have to respect his ability, I just feel like there are too many parts where he could have played for the song and instead crammed as many notes in as possible. I found this was more prevalent on controller than absent light though. Just my opinion.
p2043
aVIn my opinion, the problem with this album was the production. It felt too thin to me, after Controller which has some of the best metal production i've ever heard. It was crushing. I can't help but feel like Absent Light was a step back, however the songwriting definitely still kicks ass.

Technical instrumental music with guest solos from artists generally considered to be firmly within progmetal (Jakub Zytecki, Aaron Marshall, et al.)? At least close enough and with enough relation to progmetal to warrant its inclusion on this list.

p2066
aV&gt; Technical\u000a\u000aThe guitar work certainly is but their songwriting just comes off as "4/4 backing track to shred over." \u000aWhen they write a song as catchy and proggy as CHON then I'll reconsider.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso implying I can't make note of an album to listen to from your post and *not* mention it in a reply.
p2067
aVI agree with the over-emphasis of shred, not that that's a disqualifier of progmetal, ha! And even that they're not nearly as proggy as CHON, sure, but there's a-plenty of bands that aren't as crazy with their metrical configurations as CHON that are still prog.\u000a\u000aIn terms of catchiness, though, I think they certainly have that going for them. Forgettable shreddiness aside, most of the songs on the full-length have very catchy choruses.
p2068
aVI agree that James Franco has a very catchy chorus. The music video just screams "look how cool we are!" and it irks me the wrong way. I realize that has no impact on how good the song is but maybe if they were humbler I'd give their albums a few more listens.

aVFALILV's Phase 2 was in my opinion the best album of the year. It had such a dynamic songwriting. And they got more experimental and crazy than ever before. It was absolute highlight

VHow under appreciated? really under appreciated. Also really altrock.\u000a\u000aThat being said, just so my comment isn't completely pointless and snarky, I do like the guitar tone, thick and warm. The texture under the outro of the bridge [around 3:00 is nice, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4nYUIoYjA4#t=183), the piano and muted guitar unison are pleasant.
p2124
aVHahah cool 150-300 views with studio quality music as well as studio playthroughs isn't under recognized at all. I'm glad you approve though, this sub can now flourish.
p2125
aVSorry, wasn't debating the lack of recognition, just think that you could put more informative words in the title than 'under appreciated'. Maybe a 'FFO: [Band Name, Band Name, Adjective]'. Glad you returned my snark though, I probably deserve it.

p2127
aVAre you objecting ('follow up with backhanded compliment alluding to musical knowledge') that I used them gosh darn plumb fancy music terms when, you know, trying to discuss music? Want me to tone down mah fancy book lernin'? How should I go about offering my opinion.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, prog music combines aspects of different genres, but this song doesn't have a lot going on, it really does come across to me as a more straightforward alternative rock song. Not really employing aspects of different genres. Maybe they have wildly contrasting songs in their catalogue that are the epitome of prog, but then in that case those other songs should be posted, not this one.

VThat vibrato needs a LOT of work.
p2132
aVcould not agree more
p2133
aVThanks for listening/commenting. Lead guitar is something I rarely dabble in, so this doesn't surprise me. What can I improve?\u000a
p2134
aVFocus on the cadence of it. It needs to have a regular feel to it. You want to create a perfect sine wave. Vibrato is nothing more than bending a note up and down repeatedly, so focus on what note you're bending to. Is it a half step or a whole step? Sometimes overbending can sound good as well, as long as it's intentional and not the product of sloppy and careless playing. Some players like to use a more violinist-inspired vibrato by increasing pressure on the string, but I find that is a less dynamic way of producing vibrato. It's far easier to use your entire hand with your thumb on the neck functioning as a fulcrum to help you more easily bend the note. Hope that helps.. I'm not fantastic at explaining these sorts of things.

aVupvote the thread for visibility and take part in the poll! thanks!
p2186
aV**Travis Dickerson**:\u000a\u000a&gt;I would love to repress Axiology. However, there is just no demand for it. No one is buying CDs anymore. I wanted to do it for the 10th year anniversary\u000abut it really makes no economic sense.  So it's not looking good. Thanatopsis first CD is about to go out of print as well.  I have been toying with doing a short run of Axiology on vinyl but the retail price would be around $25. Not sure of the interest there either. It's looking like we have passed the CD singularity and will now be ( in best Steven Hawking voice) stretched into spaghetti.\u000a\u000a&gt;I've added a [poll](http://www.tdrsmusic.com/forum2/index.php?topic=2866.0) just to get some idea of demand before I commit to anything.\u000aI don't want to pre-sell anything because the last time I did we came way short and I'm still out of pocket on the repress I did anyway. Also, I don't want to collect money and have to refund 30 or 40 transactions. I would need  75 to 100 people say they would commit, then I would need 75 to actually pre-buy a repress. I really don't think there is anywhere close to that demand but for the sake of those that are encouraging me and would like to see something happen, I'll at least explore the idea.\u000a\u000a&gt;If there is an interest in vinyl, It would probably be a pressing of 200 only as a commemoration of Axiology's 10th anniversary. I would probably remix it to tape and remaster for vinyl and do a 180 gram pressing. I might sign and number the editions sold to the pre-sale buyer, something like that.\u000a\u000a&gt;The poll above has an option to just repress the CD, that might be the most practical option for most people who want to actually listen to the record, but I just don't know. I think most people who are interested in Thanatopsis have the CD, but i may be surprised, let's see.

aVYes indeed. Their album Wreckage of Stars is amazing.

aVEarly Leprous has an Opeth vibe. [Passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nim10BdaTMw) or [White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pY25gvLIFQ) maybe. Not as evil as Opeth can be, but they have a bit of the same melancholy. \u000a\u000aI highly recommend their new albums as well. A bit less Opeth, but definitely top notch prog metal thats not "8 string Axe fx music"\u000a\u000aSome great ones are [Forced Entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxAIsZldltA), [Restless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=986iAyQpr1U), [Foe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi8NyQvhCUc).\u000a\u000aIhsahn as well - [Unhealer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHdCJKWnvRg)(Even with Mikael on vocals, hah)
p2212
aVOvid's Withering is pretty great IMO but as other's have pointed out, Opeth is the pinnacle.  Also, you might want to try Bloodbath with Mikael as well.  They're not as proggy but really dark and heavy.

asVSteven Wilson - Perfect Life
p2234
(lp2235
VPlayed this loud on my telly with the lights off. I fucking cried my eyes out. Absolutely wonderful song, and I can't wait for the full record.
p2236
aVI love that he's showing more of his storyteller side. "When I was thirteen I had a sister for six months" is a chilling line to start a song, almost a complete story on its own.
p2237
aVan odd song to release out of the context of the whole album but I guess he wanted to show a song that showed the theme of the album.  
p2238
aVFeels like a teaser thing rather than a legit song release.
p2239
aVYeah this song seems like one that would benefit more from its context within the album as a whole. That said, I still found it quite beautiful and a nice taste of what is to come. And the video for it was gorgeous as well.
p2240
aVPeople are hating on the song in general expecting Steven Wilson to be a generic progressive rock artist... but he's so much more than that. While certainly not a song you would hear in Raven, it certainly carries the signature SW emotion.
p2241
aVNot what I expected, but I loved it! I wonder why Lasse Hoile didn't direct.
p2242
aVLasse's style is generally really bleak and dark which doesn't seem to be what Steven was going for here. I guess that's why.
p2243
aVIf I recall, Lasse's doing some other work somewhere for the album, maybe for the deluxe edition book and whatnot.  It seems Steven's reaching out to work with other artists, as he did with Hajo Mueller and Jess Cope on Raven material.\u000a\u000aPlus Lasse seems to be working with other musicians lately (directed Anathema's last DVD for one) so he might just be busy.\u000a\u000aYour point is probably also a factor.
p2244
aVI watched this and then bought tickets to one of his shows. \u000a\u000aI had an opportunity to see him in Blackfield a few years back. During the 'Welcome to my DNA' tour. But SW father passed away when he was supposed to play. So, unfortunately yet very understanding, he canceled. \u000aThat was my only opportunity to have seen him because he rarely tours anywhere around where I live. \u000a\u000aNow I'm second row! \u000a\u000aI'm very excited. My dream show is seeing SW play! Woo! 
p2245
aVI saw him in 2013 during the Raven tour. He was brilliant.
p2246
aVThat's awesome. I really wanted to see him on that tour. I swear I didn't take that album out of my car for a solid 8 months. Haha. I still listen to it and get goosebumps. 
p2247
aVSo simple, yet so beautiful. I love everything this guy does.
p2248
aVBeautiful song, but I really hope the narration is for the video and not part of the song or all over the album.
p2249
aVPretty sure it is on the song. Definitely not all over the album, maybe a few more bits here or there.
p2250

aVFor a hoot I shazammed the song and it was identified as "Perfect Life (Grand Union Mix)"  which is listed as a "special feature" on the BD version of the album...   So I am not too sure if this is the actual thing we we'll be hearing on the album itself..

aVThe only problem with this song is the placement on the album. Candlelight Fantasia should come before this. Nothing can follow this track.
p2288
aVWait, what are you saying?\u000a\u000aCandlelight Fantasia can follow any song!
p2289

aVI've listened to CF for 5 times since I saw this post. Nothing can ruin CF for me...
p2291
aVI agree. I thought until recently that Candlelight was a bonus track, like Masquerade on The Odyssey. I love the song but it is weird to not end it with the title track.

aVThe thing with getting into this realm of jazz fusion is that, from the djent/metal perspective, you may not be aware of just how good the guys who live in that world are. And so, from a djent mindset, this is excellent guitar work. From the fusion side, there are a *lot* of guys putting stuff out like this, and with better arranging chops on top of it.
p2313
aVWell, yeah. I mean, I'm not comparing this to the likes of Al Di Meola but I still think his sense of phrasing and melodic arrangements are solid.

Great prominent bass parts, good solo, cool vocal harmonies especially on the outro, and I love the whimsical background clean pattern. Yes, has djenty elements, but I like that that's hardly the signature sound of the song, lots of different textures going on!

VI love this album. \u000a\u000aStill remains is one of my favorite songs, especially the intro and outro to  it.
p2321
aVagreed, though this one is probably my second fav from the album
p2322
aVProbably my favorite album of theirs. Definitely need to re-listen to it tomorrow.
p2323
aVI think this is the first time I've seen a Fates Warning song that isn't on their first four albums. It surprises me that their later material (like this) isn't posted more often because it is some fantastic stuff.
p2324
aVAgreed. Honestly, I think this album and FWX are my favorites. Another Perfect Day is an awesome song.
p2325
aVMan what a task it is to narrow down a favourite Fates Warning album. I simply can't do it, they're all so good and different.\u000a\u000aI'll have to listen to FWX more, I just picked it up late last year and have only heard it a few times. I do remember it impressing me though.
p2326
aVI like it quite a bit. I kind of just jumped straight into Fates Warning and downloaded their whole discography in one fell swoop and had no idea where to start, and FWX was one of the first albums to immediately grab me. It's not mindblowingly awesome or anything like that but the songs are catchy and well-enough written that they were able to stick with me long enough to hold my interest before I got to meatier albums.
p2327
aVI'm going to listen to FWX right now. Since we've been talking about it, I've realized I could use more Fates Warning in my life. Such a great band, always willing to switch it up and make something brand new and awesome with every release.\u000a\u000aHave you heard their latest album yet? I've only heard songs here and there. That one and Night on Brocken are the only albums I haven't heard in full. I'm really looking forward to one day finally listening to Darkness in a Different Light, I've only heard good to great things about it.
p2328
aVActually no I haven't - FWX is their most recent one that I've listened to. I'm going to go have to go track that down and give it a shot when I get home from work! Thanks for the heads up!
p2329
aVNo problem, but don't take my word for it as I'm just going on other people's opinions and the few tracks I've heard. It could still be a stinker... Nah, this is Fates Warning we're talking about, there are no stinkers!\u000a\u000aFYI, FWX is really impressing me again. No tracks are really standing out individually to me but the album as a whole is just beautiful.
p2330
aVYeah, that's kind of how I felt about it too. None of the songs really struck me as particularly incredible on their own, but there's a definite degree of consistency that most albums don't pull off - I can't think of any songs on that album that I *don't* like off the top of my head, and like I said earlier, I still find myself singing Another Perfect Day in my head pretty often.
p2331
aVIt's a really spectacular album for how consistent it is. There isn't a weak moment, I was digging it all the way through and it kept drawing me in again and again. My attention didn't stray despite being distracted on the Internet.\u000a\u000aThanks for getting me to listen again. I would have eventually, but it made my Friday just that much more enjoyable.

aVMan, sometimes I feel like this subreddit is /r/periphery.
p2350
aVWell periphery iiiis a prog metal band...
p2351
aVYea, I agree, this subreddit can be saturated with them. Personally, I don't even care too much for them. They are good but I don't so much of the hype. Spencer's vocals are quite contrived and certainly pretentious at times, and ruins the experience.\u000a\u000aEither way, they are headliners canceling their appearance. It is worth mentioning.
p2352
aVI don't really care if people post a lot of Periphery songs. They just released a double album - and a lot of it is really good.\u000a\u000aBut this subreddit really *isn't* for posting side-related articles like "band X cancels a show". As far as I'm concerned, this subreddit is primarily for posting MUSIC and secondarily about posting articles related to upcoming albums.
p2353
aVWell,  then you are inexcusably wrong. 
p2354
aVWe'll see how many more people care about my troll post compared to your *news*.
p2355
aVScottish prog metal fan here. I could seriously not give less of a fuck about Periphery cancelling a show.\u000a\u000aHow did you feel when Animals as Leaders and TesseracT cancelled their Glasgow show in November? Let me guess, you didn't hear about it.
p2356
aVI am super bummed about this
p2357
aVI take a little issue to your referring to Nothing More as a "shit sandwich." Their music is quite good for being radio friendly, they have some prog influence, and they put on a hell of a show.
p2358
aVI agree with you, but I think you're forgetting Wovenwar in there too, and they fit the shit sandwich bill pretty well for me :(
p2359
aVI can't blame them, but I'm pissed. TYS and Periphery are my favorite bands. To see that TYS is only playing for 20 minutes and the headliner is not coming is very upsetting. I bought my tickets in November. I expect a full refund or a free show from Periphery.\u000a\u000aIf I don't go to work because I'm sick, I don't get paid. If Periphery isn't coming to work because their sick, I don't want to pay them. It hurts to type that considering they are my favorite band but come on...
p2360
aVI completely agree here. Like I said, when they came to Tampa, they played a short show. I doubt they did this for NYC. Instead of giving that time to TYS, they just let us all leave early. Thanks guys.\u000a\u000aIt just seems wrong to cancel the last show of the tour and not provide more to the fans that purchased so far in advance.

p2362
(lp2363
VIt's weird how you use all these longer words, but spell so many of them incorrectly.\u000a\u000aAnyway, my unhelpful comment aside, here's some ideas! In no particular order:\u000a\u000a1.) [Gru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygiq6AMBGko) - Very spacey atmosphere, fascinatingly kinetic grooves. Also has a very distinct lick vocabulary when soloing.\u000a\u000a2.) [Widek](http://widekmusic.bandcamp.com/) - Like Gru, but slightly more aggressive with a bit more chugging. Both are from Poland, and Widek features Gru on *many* tracks, so if you can't get enough of Gru solos on his own album, here's more!\u000a\u000a3.) [Cloudkicker](http://cloudkickermusic.com/music) - While I would say that some of his releases are a bit on the aggressive side enough to deter casual listeners, bunch of his stuff is more crossover into post-rock/metal. Fade, Subsume, Let Yourself Be Huge, Little Histories.\u000a\u000a4.) [Theo Young](http://theoyoung.bandcamp.com/) - He's like Plini. That's a good thing.\u000a\u000a5.) [Axel B. Egenaes](http://axelbe.bandcamp.com/releases) - Just one 3-track ep so far, but nice mix of additional synth and piano textures, less completely guitar-focused.\u000a\u000a6.) [Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN0q19AZLbSc_SBpOL-zmb7RzZ5aWsmKy) - Rather cheerful instrumental, arguably not really metal even, but a lot of upbeat grooves. Fun.\u000a\u000a7.) [Animals as Leaders](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH22-xSMERQpG4M9HshhXUJ9OKMNlwU8T) - Joy of Motion specifically has very beautiful, perhaps less aggressive songs. Maybe avoid a few of the heavier songs (Kascade, Tooth and Claw, Mind-Spun and Nephele).\u000a\u000a8.) [Maybeshewill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9cUYMvcBmQ) - If you've got GIAA on your playlist, I'd put in Maybeshewill, easily my favorite post-rock group, 2 most recent albums specifically are gorgeous.\u000a\u000aI've tried to stay within the boundaries of 'completely instrumental, not super heavy', hope that helps!
p2364
aVSorry Michael, unfortunately this work computer has to run IE so I don't have spell check to cover up my real lack of intellect that I try to hide with articulation.\u000aPolyphia is someone I added onto the playlist shortly after this post, I believe a guitarist from Plini is a member of Polyphia?\u000aBut you have given plenty for research, thank you for the lengthy answer, god speed sir!\u000a\u000aEdit: Holy fuck Theo Young is incredible.
p2365
aVTheo young is amazing, its absolutely criminal how little exposure he has.
p2366
aVYah, I didn't find his ep until at least a month after it came out, completely surprised me out of nowhere! I've since gotten him to do a guest solo on an ep I've got coming out, and that surprised me too, bit more of a nice Zytecki fusion feel. Damn versatile guy.
p2367
aVThe range of his guitar play on that EP alone is mind blowing, actually purchased his EP, hope he comes to the South of England at some point would love to watch his play.\u000a

aV[Exivious](http://exivious.bandcamp.com/)\u000a\u000aMight be more aggressive than what you're looking for for your shop, but try it on your own.  Especially the new album since you seem to like fusion metal and post-rock.
p2385
aVI do indeed, so many bands I want to play so bad but can't i.e Corellia(maybe some of there instrumental songs, Sounds of Glaciers Moving, most beautiful guitar tone I've ever heard), Caligula's Horse, Distant Signals, Abscent Distance, Irepress, Aviations and many more!\u000aBut I shal check those out in a appropriate enviroment, heh.

Plini and these other bands are a staple for car rides with my friends and family.
p2392
aVI'm more worried about negative Trip Advisors such as;\u000a"Lovely food, but a terrible racket out the speaker system" \u000aBut I'm with you brother, the Car is such a great place to open up close family/friends musical tastes to some truly wonderful and talented artists like Plini! We shall convert the heathens one car trip at a time!
p2393
aVGod is an Astronaut is more like post-rock, but if you like Plini you can try Mestis, Exivious, Chimp Spanner, Scale the Summit, Canvas Solaris, Pomegranate Tiger, Special Providence, Step in Fluid, Gru, Widek and Angel Vivaldi. :)

aVThanks dude, would explain why I have never seen God is an Astronaught on this subreddit before, maybe I shall explore Post-Rock slightly more.\u000aThanks for the help bro!
p2395
aVYou're welcome ! \u000aWell, Post-rock is not progressive nor metal so, this explains why you have not seen it there haha ! But post-rock is great ! If you like full intrumental post-rock such as God is an Astronaut I'd recommend you Russian Circles, MONO or Explosions in the Sky.
p2396
aVRussian Circles!! Dayum I forget about them, they are perfect, thank you for reminding me, I've also seen Explosions in the Sky in a few of my related videos whilst searching, they are next on my list!\u000aThank you pal!

aVAnother good band is If These Trees Could Talk, another post-rock band you'd like if you're a fan of God is an Astronaut.
p2398
aVRussian Circles is so good! I can't stop listening to Enter.
p2399
aVPost-rock is one genre I enjoy a lot, so here's some recommendations:\u000a\u000a- [LITE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlWiRjIcjOk) is a Japanese one, it's Math-rock rather than post-rock, but still fits your needs, I think.\u000a- [Long Distance Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km0SXsjTFzI) is one of my favorite post-rock bands, but be warned that they like to put some short movie dialogues and things like that in their songs, and some songs have vocals, like [this amazing one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsR0cgJRw-Q)\u000a- [Macaco Bong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjF0Wr_vHg8) is a Brazilian [my country] one that I don't really know how to classify, but they're really good and instrumental only, AFAIK.\u000a- [And So I Watch You From Afar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRD8z4cTjTM) is a more energetic band, compared to most of the post-rock ones.\u000a\u000a- And of course, [If These Trees Could Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfJBiR9f9t8), my favorite post-rock band. 
p2400
aVLITE are great fun man, added! \u000aIf these Trees Could Talk, also added, absolutely gorgeous! \u000aLong Distance Calling: Well I was trying to avoid vocals, but if the vocals are featuring the legendary Jonas Renkse, exceptions can be made, his voice is perfect for Post-Rock. Dissolving The Bonds is one of my favourite songs ever.
p2401
aVIf you like GiaA check out Maybeshewill. One of my favorite post rock bands! 
p2402
aVGru, Scale The Summit, Widek, The Contortionist, Cloudkicker.

aVKinda like Vjildharta....I fucking love it!! Bit too extreme for my playlist but favorited, thank you very much for the introduction!
p2418
aVWalking Across Jupiter.   One of my favorite instrumental albums.    It's always been a name your price on Bandcamp.  So good though
p2419
aVI remember stumbling across these a while ago, love the heavy guitars over serene synths. Call me crazy, but a slight Gojira-esk-ness to them.
p2420
aVShokran: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3Xd6SWFCs
p2421
aVShokran are awesome, bit to aggressive for my shop, but I'm joining you in the Shokran love brother.\u000a\u000aEdit: That is the most awesome album art I've ever seen, also god DAYUM Shokran are sooo good.
p2422
aVThey are amazing and they have a new album coming this year, I'm pumped
p2423
asVIs the sidebar an actual picture of Plini?
p2424
(lp2425
VYep that's Plini. He's becoming more and more prominent on camera recently with his [playthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZUdXcfI0jo) and he recently posted a photo of himself with Marco Minnemann on his social networks a few months back.
p2426
aVHadn't seen that playthrough, thanks!
p2427
asVCan any prog metal/rock vets suggest some bands for a newbie?
p2428
(lp2429
VIf you adore Coheed and Cambria and Protest the Hero, there's a good chance you will like Thank You Scientist.
p2430
aVIf you're alive, there's a good chance you will like Thank You Scientist.
p2431
aVListen to Black Crown Initiate. Their album "The Wreckage of Stars" has a blend of prog/tech death/post metal and they have great clean vocals that contrast nicely with the barking/growling vocals. Their EP "Song of the Crippled Bull" is also really good. For starters though, maybe start off with the songs "Great Mistake" and "Purge" from their full length. I'm on mobile so can't link.\u000a\u000aBesides that everyone seems to be giving pretty good suggestions.
p2432
aVI second this. I heard them on Sirius Liquid Metal and bought the album. Their influences are very diverse which gives them a unique sound.  
p2433
aVI would have gone with The Malignant. It's riffs are too tasty
p2434
aVYeah it was a hard choice. I really like The Malignant and the title track a lot too. Really, I like the whole album though.
p2435
aVYeah, man, I completely agree. When BCI first surfaced and was being the band to pick up where Opeth left off, I completely blew them off. And then I just bought the album because fuck it and man that record is amazing. I've listened to it probably 40-50 times since Christmas. 
p2436
aV[Cynic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCwZIXymW1I)\u000a\u000a[Devin Townsend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fDLeSp5_Gw)\u000a\u000a[Fates Warning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvM9CGZEHOE)
p2437
aVUpvote for Devin Townsend!\u000a\u000aHe's kind of been leaning toward a softer, vaguer style as of late, but [Synchestra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJtZMA76deY) is one of the best metal albums in existence.
p2438
aVSynchestra is the one that got me hooked on him. The version of Pixillate that opens the encore of the show I posted is pure eargasm.
p2439
aVYou have quite a span in there. Prog metal/rock is a big field to play in. You should try **Tesseract** and **Skyharbor** (same guy singing in both bands). If you want to try something a little different, check out **Karnivool** (I recommend them to everybody...). Maybe you should check out **Between The Buried And Me**. While not entirely my thing, they are really loved by this subreddit and they make very complex songs. I just can't stand their kind of harsh singing. Should be no big thing for you coming from tech death.
p2440
aV* Last Chance to Reason\u000a* The Contortionist\u000a* Opeth
p2441
aVAll of these bands. Also Between the buried and me, scale the summit, and king crimson.
p2442
aVCrimson is like Mars Volta in the 70's, kinda.
p2443
aVLast Chance to Reason has the same singer as Contortionist right?
p2444
aVYes, Michael Lessard. He's a good guy. An acquaintance of mine.
p2445
aVAwesome. His vocals on the Language album were amazing, I like his style. I've only listened to a couple of songs from Last Chance to Reason, but again, really unique voice.
p2446
aVYes
p2447
aVThese three bands are brilliant. Especially Opeth.
p2448
aVWhat's the essential Opeth record?
p2449
aVMany consider Blackwater Park as their best one and essential Opeth, i didn't get into them much before listening to Watershed and Ghost Reveries. Other stuff like Orchid etc is good too, but i'd say these three are the best and essential. Damnation is acoustic, completely different but great anyways.\u000a\u000a
p2450
aVThanks for the quick reply. Just threw the rest of my salary to the iTunes.
p2451
aVMy personal favorite is Ghost Reveries. It's epic as hell
p2452
aVThat's gotta be my favorite opeth album. 
p2453
aVStill Life man. Still life is just freaking amazing. 
p2454
aVBlack Water Park is what you'll probably hear around here
p2455
aVYou bet!
p2456
aVGhost Reveries is my personal fav
p2457
aVArguably either Ghost Reveries or Blackwater Park. I got into Opeth with Ghost Reveries and it remains my favorite, but Blackwater Park is incredibly good to.
p2458

aVYou're goddamn right.
p2462
aV[The Safety Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy1mbDmaXXE) - One of the most unique prog metal bands, can´t think of any band that sounds like them, both their albums are amazing but the latest one is more consistent in terms of sound and flow. This song is a collaboration with the singer of \u000a\u000a[Between the Buried and Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi_TafYAcd8), prog metal legends that you HAVE to check out. Their 2007 album Colors is widely regarded as a masterpiece, where the band started to distance themselves even further from their metalcore roots and songstructures to create this album that can also be regarded as one big song as all the songs flow into each other seemlessly. Another big favorite of mine is\u000a\u000a[The Contortionist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48oRWWhNezo) - Their debut album "Exoplanet" is mostly a straight up deathcore release with lots of progressive parts sprinkled in between, a favorite of fans who prefer their heavier side. On their follow up record "Intrinsic" they focus much more on dense atmosphere with jazzy chorld progressions, but still with many heavy and groovy parts (my favorite album by them). Their last record Language was also well received and is a continuation of them finding their own sound, this time even less heavier.
p2463
aV[The Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_3T9TI8bw)\u000a\u000a[Intronaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el9L-PnaYOc)

aVYou guys are extremely welcoming/helpful. I'm just going through the many suggestions now and enjoying a great deal of them
p2465
aVYou should also check out mandroid echostar they seen like your kind of band
p2466
aVOkay so I made this list of 74 recommended albums recently to give to a friend, it's rather extensive and you will definitely find something you like. Everything is labelled by genre and even has a suggested song link embedded. \u000a\u000aIt's also not all progressive metal so there's some oddball choices in there but they're still great albums. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.dropbox.com/s/86vuhev6gsx4xhq/Albums.xlsx?dl=0
p2467
aVDamn, I feel like you and Rollosh just need to have some RYM lists or something ready for all your recs, you've always got the perfect suggestions and there's always something new. Like holy shit where has Macross 82-99 been all my life??
p2468
aVI think if me and /u/Rollosh made a compilation list the world might implode. \u000a\u000aMacross 82-99 is great. FutureFunk itself is a great genre to kick back and jam too. Check out Groovy Godzilla as well, he's on that list.
p2469
aV"The Woven Womb" haha. \u000a\u000aWas that intentional?
p2470
aVShit, no it wasn't. I thought it was called that off the top of my head!
p2471
aVGave me a chuckle. It was worth it.
p2472
aVIn a surprising move for this sub, nobody has yet mentioned Haken. Not a lot of growls at all, but the high-pitched vocals are really good, and they tend to be a favorite around here.
p2473
aVI finally got around to listening to these guys seriously the other day... and now I can't stop playing The Mountain. That shit has been on repeat for like five days now.
p2474
aVDiscovered this band because of this sub! 
p2475
aVTry a little bit of [Riverside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA7fNZuzFFc).
p2476
aVI can't believe no one's mentioned Dream Theater yet, or maybe it's just understood. Metropolis pt2: Scenes from a Memory is probably their best album, and Octavarium is incredible (the song, not the album)
p2477
aVI think if you're on this sub, there's a pretty high chance that you've been exposed to DT even if it's not your cup of tea. I won't say they "invented" the subgenre but they've influenced it tremendously and were definitely pioneers. They're kind of a staple. Love DT. 
p2478
aVPlease check out our Hall of Fame (clickable from the top left of the page). 
p2479
aVSince they both have former Periphery vocalist Chris Barretto, you'll probably like Monuments and Ever Forthright.  Musically, they have a ton in common with bands like Periphery, Tesseract, and Animals as Leaders.\u000a\u000aSince you mention you like a mixture of high-pitched singing and growls, you'll probably like a lot of what melodic death metal has to offer.  Check out some Mercenary, Scar Symmetry, or Into Eternity for some that fit your description.\u000a\u000aI can't link to YouTube at work, but here are some song recommendations from the bands mentioned.\u000a\u000a* Monuments - Atlas\u000a* Ever Forthright - Screen Scenarios\u000a* Tesseract - Nocturne\u000a* Animals as Leaders - CAFO\u000a* Mercenary - World Hate Center\u000a* Scar Symmetry - Ghost Prototype I: Measurement of Thought\u000a* Into Eternity - Timeless Winter

If you like them, you'll enjoy [Spiral Architect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyh9CQTdV_k).
p2488
aVmabye Stolas and Devil Sold His Soul. more of the post-hardcore direction but still progressive in my opinion.
p2489
aV[Twelve Foot Ninja - "Luna"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjNwM0uJE8o)\u000a\u000a[Tesseract - "Eden"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBFxpH9N4G4)
p2490
aVHave you tried Tesseract? They have two full length albums and both of them are very cool.
p2491
aVAnyone who is looking to expand their progressive library should at least give Ne Obliviscaris a chance. Simply put, it's an incredible sounding mix of prog and black metal. 
p2492
aV[Fall Of Troy](http://youtu.be/jNnR7AbrO4Q)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a[This Town Needs Guns](http://youtu.be/DOHGTJoh498)
p2493
aVBased on the bands you've listed Between the Buried and Me, Skyharbour and Tesseract would probably be worth a shot. If you're into tech death I'm sure you've probably already hear Focus by Cynic but if not all their other albums are great too. If you don't mind instrumental I'd also try Animals as Leaders, Cloudkicker and Scale the Summit
p2494
aVSo this is not progressive metal or progressive rock. In fact this doesn't even come close to answering what you asked, but you said you like high pitched vocals mixed with growls. I'd like to suggest a fun band that is more thrash.  So put on your denim vest, crack open an ice cold beer, and enjoy 3 Inches of Blood:\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/JO7TZGgBbOw\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/ov1XxyvCS3o\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/_Y8xwttdjCc\u000a
p2495
aVI'm a bit surprised no one has said this yet, but Dream Theater. Probably one of the most sell known prog metal bands out there. They not known for any growls, but high voice is one of their most well known qualities. 
p2496
aV[Mother's Cake!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOd154X302Y)
p2497
aVCheck out Erra, they have a nice mix of high vocals and growls.\u000a\u000aYou should also look into Job For a Cowboy's newest album if you haven't already, it's fucking incredible.\u000a\u000aDefinitely check out Between the Buried and Me. I would start by listening to Colors and Parallax II.\u000a\u000aAnimals as Leaders is an amazing instrumental band, absolutely worth your attention.\u000a\u000aMonuments is a great band who have released two awesome albums, and they have a good mix of harsh and clean vocals.\u000a\u000aChances are good that you've heard Fallujah already, but if not, their most recent album is my favorite album of last year.\u000a\u000aBeyond Creation is great technical death metal/progressive metal if you haven't heard of them.\u000a\u000aThe Dillinger Escape Plan is awesome mathcore, with a good mix of clean vocals and harsh. One Of Us is the Killer is a pretty awesome album.\u000a\u000aYeah, this seems like a good starting list. Hope you like some of these!
p2498
aVThank You Scientist, TesseracT, the Contortionist (check out their newest album, it's the tits), Protest the Hero. You've probably heard of these and I'm site others will mention them. 
p2499
aVTool, Porcupine tree, Karnivool, Jolly, a lot like birds, sianvar, hail the sun, circa survive (have some proggy things), pain of salvation, a perfect circle, glass cloud, 
p2500
aVIf you like Corelia please go support the recording of their new album. It's gonna be epic. 
p2501
aVHow has no one mentioned Meshuggah? They're one of the biggest influences on prog metal along with Dream Theater, though their sounds are completely different. Meshuggah is definitely more prog/tech-death, their earlier albums like "Contradictions Collapse" and "Destroy Erase Improve" are pretty thrashy with odd rhythms, and they eventually developed the whole "djent" sound with their albums "Nothing" "I" and "Catch Thirtythree" which used downtuned 8 string guitars, medium, groovy tempos, atonal/chromatic melodies and chord structures, and heavy use of polymeter (guitars and bass pedals playing in various oddball time signatures while snare/cymbal sticks generally with 4/4). Personally my favorite is Catch 33 as it is one long 45 minute piece of music but Destroy Erase Improve, Nothing, and Obzen are great albums that showcase their old/mid-career/newer styles.
p2502
aVIf you like Tech-death you will like [Rings of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6oSVDU_Tvg)\u000a\u000aIf you like protest the hero, you will like [Raiju](http://raijumusic.bandcamp.com/)\u000a\u000aIf you like Closure in Moscow, you will like [Dance Gavin Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRah1_OSu9I)\u000a\u000a[The Afterimage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpKT_oooX9o) is the just the best
p2503
aVCynic \u000a\u000aScar Symmetry\u000a\u000aMastodon
p2504
aVA lot of people say that Protest the Hero is the band most similar to Dillinger Escape Plan in terms of vocals and song structure. I am a huge DEP fan and when someone recommended PTH to me I was instantly hooked. I would recommend starting out with "Widower", "Black Bubblegum", and "Milk Lizard". If you're looking for harder stuff they have that too!
p2505
aV&gt; Protest the Hero is the band most similar to Dillinger Escape Plan in terms of vocals and song structure\u000a\u000aThese bands sound literally nothing alike.
p2506
aVVocals and song structure= transitions from hard screaming to melodic singing, raging guitar and drums to piano. They may not be the same in terms of instrumentation, but otherwise I disagree. 
p2507
asVDream Theater is heading to the studio in February to begin work on new album.
p2508
(lp2509
V"It will sound like another Dream Theater album," sources say.
p2510
aV[deleted]
p2511
aVAgreed. I'm a die-hard fan, favorite band in the world and I probably made it through the new cd maybe twice. 
p2512
aVIt's satisfying to see that people with this opinion are becoming more outspoken. It felt for a while that I was one of very few who actually abhorred the latest album.     
p2513
aVIt didn't take long for people to get out of it. Illumination Theory had clouded a lot of opinions on the album, but every time people praised it, they used this as their go-to and when the praise for that faded, so did it for the album. I like Illumination Theory too, though the out-of-place and overly long middle makes that a hard opinion to have for me, but the rest of the album felt pretty weak.
p2514
aVI agree. I like the 6-7 first minutes of Illumination Theory, but kind of have problems after that. \u000a\u000aThe album has some good moments (Behind The Veil is something I would listen on repeat for a while).
p2515
aVI love the middle section of Illumination Theory! I just don't particularly like the rest of the song! The Bigger Picture is the one song on there that I would think twice before skipping on shuffle, the rest is pretty mediocre stuff
p2516
aVI tried a few times to listen to it but it is very underwhelming to me and the songs seem very proud of themselves with nothing really new to offer.  I really liked ADTOE and I was not expecting to like it at all.  \u000a\u000aThe best part of Illumination Theory to me is that part of it sort of sounds like FF7-battle music.  Other than that, it sounds over-processed and I feel like I've heard it all before.\u000a\u000aEdit: Enigma Machine is the only song that made me feel like I was listening to Dream Theater.
p2517
aVas long as Labrie is in that band I'll never be happy. I feel like after Scenes from a Memory he just got worse and worse.
p2518
aVI swear in thirty years DT is the band that our kids will dig out of our collections and look at us weird. "You liked this stuff? With that guy?!" \u000a\u000aI've never liked his approach to be fair.
p2519
aVScenes From a Memory is around the time he had the food poisoning incident that damaged his vocal cords, so that's probably about right. It wasn't until the past five years or so that Labrie said his voice feels like his voice fully recovered.
p2520
aVI think he had that incident between the recording of Awake and A Change of Seasons. For some reason the vocals on A Change of Season, Falling into Infinity and SFaM don't bother me near as much as the albums after that. I think it also has to do with the fact that the lyrics in most DT songs are just terrible.
p2521
aVI gotta say, imo, every now and then Dream Theater makes some pretty nifty lyrics. Most aren't that great, but the ones that are I really like.
p2522
aVThat sounds about right actually. I want to say it was around Christmas 1997.\u000a\u000aAnd even as a big DT fan, I'll agree that the lyrics are pretty bad more often than not.
p2523
aVI wish they did what King Crimson did (at least in the first incarnations), get a kickass lyricist and focus on blowing people's minds with the music.
p2524
aVThey had a kickass lyricist. He left the band after recording Awake.
p2525
aVThat's true, I do love Wait for Sleep and Space Dye Vest
p2526
aVIn fairness I always thought the lyrics written by the other guys on I&amp;W and Awake were good too. After Awake everybody just seemed to forget how to write lyrics
p2527
aVThat's a fair assessment. But I've always liked Kevin's the most.
p2528
aVOh agreed, he was definitely the best of the lot, but I feel the others all went downhill when he left (lyric wise)
p2529
aVIt was around Christmas 1994 
p2530
aVgah hes so bad.
p2531
aVIllumination Theory is pretty great. It's no Octivarium, but still a song that I really liked.
p2532
aVDude, give it a whirl. It was surprisingly pretty solid. Completely blew ADTOE out of the water. But that album was complete garbage IMHO.
p2533
aVInteresting opinion, definitely seems to be the other way round for most people, myself included. ADTOE had some great stuff whereas the latest album was mostly mediocre
p2534
aVI just felt like there was more feeling in the music on the S/T. ADTOE just had a bit too much wankery on it for me. But hey, dif people hear different things!
p2535
aVDT is one of those bands that I wish had a resident lyricist so they focus on making awesome music. \u000a\u000aAlso if they took a bit longer to write albums, their last ones felt a bit rushed.
p2536
aV...Please tell me that pun was intentional
p2537
aVI certainly didn't need a looking glass to see that one...
p2538
aVSorry, what did you say? I lost my train of thought.
p2539
aVWell that took a dramatic turn of events
p2540
aVNow there's systematic chaos going on.
p2541
aV&gt; rushed.\u000a\u000aHeh. I get it.
p2542
aVI'm not crazy about post- portnoy dream theater. A dramatic turn of events was a really good album, but the sound was already starting to sound... over processed to me a little bit. The new album did not impress me at all. Their sound isn't good anymore, the songwriting wasn't that great, and it sounds like mangini triggered every piece of equipment on his set. \u000a\u000aI'm really trying not to just be butthurt about portnoy. I know he's not coming back, but I genuinely don't think mangini is right for the band. I really think I would have liked them more if they picked up marco minneman. \u000a\u000aAnyway, I'll give this album a shot, but I fear it will drive me down to someone who's just casually aware of them. Flying Colors is starting to take their place as my favorite prog band (not to mention symphony x and porcupine tree).
p2543
aVI feel like part of the reason I couldn't enjoy the self titled as much as I wanted to was due to the mix and production quality. Everything was too damn loud. The drums were triggered to fuck and there were no dynamics to be found on the album (Speaking as if you looked at the wave form of the album). Same with Breaking the Fourth Wall, Mangini's drums were so obviously/badly triggered, other than that, it is a fantastic performance. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of thing I can just listen to, I need to watch it, otherwise the drums just overpower everything and ruin it.\u000a\u000aIt makes me sad not to enjoy something of theirs as much as maybe I should, because I love DT, and musically speaking, the last album was pretty good (not great, but good). I hope they go back to a more organic and cleaner mix 
p2544
aVI find it difficult to make the switch from portnoys very raw and very natural sound to manginis... sound. I just don't like little decisions he makes either. Like when they played the shattered fortress (which I don't think they should do without portnoy, but that's neither here nor there) they got to the heavy part right after the first chorus. Portnoy played that with his hi hat riding open, which fit the part. Mangini played with his tightly shut. That little thing ruined a very cool part of the song for me. Well, that, and johns tone sounding like someone poured mud in his amp. 
p2545
aVThat was the first thing I thought when I heard that. He totally killed the groove at that part. I could even tolerate Petrucci's tone on Breaking the Fourth Wall but so many parts were just ruined or changed by Mangini.
p2546
aVWhich is funny, because didn't they decide against marco minneman because they didn't like that he changed things? 
p2547
aVI was pretty sure they hired Mangini so that he could play the parts exactly like they were meant to be played. I think it's fair to give him some freedom on his own albums, Dramatic and DT, but I don't think he should interpret the other albums that he didn't participate on. 
p2548
aVEspecially a song like the shattered fortress, seeing as it was portnoys song. I don't really think they should play that anymore as it is, let alone change it.
p2549
aVMarco stated in an interview that he originally didn't want the job and that Dream Theater always had Mangini in mind from the get go. While Marco could have gotten the job, that would mean he would have had to put Dream Theater first no matter what and Marco didn't want that. So while Marco would have been great, I prefer him with Steven Wilson, The Aristocrats and Joe Satriani. Mangini doesn't get much of a say apparently in song writing, so maybe if he got to write some songs some good could come from it.
p2550
aV&gt; Flying Colors is starting to take their place as my favorite prog band (not to mention symphony x and porcupine tree).\u000a\u000aJudging by the bands you like, you should check out the Flower Kings and Transatlantic (although I'm guessing you're aware of the latter already).
p2551
aVTransatlantic is great.
p2552
aVYea, Flying Colors is pretty great. Neal Morse still knows how to write great tunes.
p2553
aVInteresting I love Mangini..He is a great fit for DT. \u000a\u000aBreaking the Fourth Wall is incredible
p2554
aVDon't get me wrong, I love him as a drummer, but it just doesn't click for me. 
p2555
aVOn one hand, Minneman would have been quite perfect for DT.\u000a\u000aOn the other, I'm *very* glad they didn't pick him, so he could be part of Steven Wilson's band. The Raven That Refused To Sing wouldn't have been the same without him.
p2556
aVI'm so excited for the new album. The studio updates sound so great.
p2557
aVI feel like they should have taken Portnoy seriously when he said they should take a break for a few years and then get back together with something better than ever.\u000a
p2558
aVThat clearly was the right thing to do. The process of writing in studio once a year worked for a few albums, but their writing started to become repetitive and indulgent. It's truly like they're a caricature of what they used to be. Each album since Train of Thought has been significantly worse than the previous, and there was really only so much I could tolerate.\u000a\u000aThe change in their creative process has even extended so far as to massively influence the style with which the members approach their instrument. Rudess only has one solo tone and style. Myung seems like all he plays is what petrucci wrote. Petrucci now has chops that are only suitable to composed music - he can no longer improvise.  Some of his best solos, live, and even on albums, were improvised. Voices, most of LTE.  At this point he has abandoned his original blues/david Gilmour influence, and his is vibrato is gone. 
p2559
aVOctivarium is arguably one of their best though.
p2560
aVSongs? Maybe. Albums? Absolutely not. Every album before it is significantly better. 
p2561
aVHit and miss album I would say, but does happen to feature the greatest song of all time
p2562
aVYea, I mean that song alone makes it one of my favorites. The themeing and structure of the album is very impressive as a whole though. \u000a\u000ahttp://dt.spatang.com/octavarium.php
p2563
aVSaid no one, ever
p2564
aVI'd absolutely agree it's in their top three.
p2565
aVImages and Words, Awake, Scenes from a Memory... where's Octavarium fitting in for you? For me it's behind those three... Train of Thought... Six Degrees... Systematic Chaos... then possibly Octavarium. Unless we're counting A Change of Seasons or Live at the Marquee, then after those too.
p2566
aVI'd substitute it in instead of Awake. I know a lot of people love that album but for some reason I just haven't listened to it a ton yet.
p2567
aVIts funny how theyve pretty much always been on a 2 year release cycle, and originally they were phenomenal. But now that I've been displeased with everything since Octavarium it's like "They're churning out another one already!?"
p2568
aVI want to care.... I really do.  
p2569
aVYes. I remember when this would fill me with glee... But I really haven't loved anything since Systematic Chaos and beyond =[
p2570
aVDamn, these guys used to be my favorite band. Haven't listened to anything after ADTOE. I just didn't like the processing they tried to go with for the drums. which also kind of turned me off to the Mangini thing...
p2571
aVWas going to say I hope the drums sound better.  The performance is fine, but they sound like Metallica's last album.  Just overly processed and clipping.
p2572
aVSuch DT hate...geez
p2573
aVIt's the cool thing to do man! Has been for over a decade now.\u000a\u000aI may not enjoy the more recent material as much as their early work, but I don't resonate with the ever present tide of disgust present in any DT discussion.
p2574
aVits not hate.  More like everyone loves the band and is sad to see their quality diminish album after album.
p2575
aVTheir filler songs have really suffered over the last few albums while the longer tracks have been decent. Maybe they should focus their effort on releasing an album with three 20 minute long songs on it instead of having a bunch of mediocre, Labrie heavy 5 minute ballads that are skipped by the time you reach your second listen. 
p2576
aVI am totally on board with this criticism. As I mentioned above, I don't resonate with the usual exaggerated DT trash talk, but this is exactly how I feel about the last decade of the band.
p2577
aVI actually really like all of the ballads on the past two albums, I seem to be in the minority on that one..
p2578
aVAlways look forward to new DT. I thought their Self Titled was their best since Octavarium. 
p2579
aVLets hope it isn't as shit as DT12. Come at me. I'm a total fanboy but that album is just bad.\u000a\u000aADTOE on the other side, is in my top5 DT albms
p2580
aVI stopped listening DTs after when - in Octavarium - I could couple a few songs with major pop bands (like Muse or U2). I mean *literally* couple; you could mix "Never Enough" with a Muse song and don't be able to tell the difference.\u000aThe only DT for me is Devin Townsend. I love that crazy guy.
p2581
aVThey kinda did that on purpose.  Every song was inspired by different artists.  MP lashed that out on the documentary for score.
p2582
aVSome songs from albums past that are pretty solid, on the whole it is definitely mediocre compared to stuff like Awake or SFAM.\u000a
p2583
aVFuck yes, so glad it's official now. This is definitely my most anticipated release of the year. I haven't been disappointed by one of their albums yet and I can't wait to see what they got in store.

asVCHON - Can't Wait
p2598
(lp2599
VI think a lot of people expect the vocals to be the forefront of the song (which is reasonable considering they typically are and CHON doesn't usually have them), but I don't think CHON sees it that way. I feel like the vocals / lyrics are extremely low key on purpose, just to add another layer to the song as opposed to becoming the focus. The melodies are very simple, the lyrics don't differ much throughout the course of the song, and the songs don't seem constructed around the vocals. I quite like it- I think they fit their style perfectly (a Spencer Sotelo type singer would be overkill, no?) and just continue to add another layer of chill to their always mellowing sound. I can see how people would interpret them as boring or bland, but I don't really think CHON is aiming to be a band with a singer, just adding them into the mix every now and then.
p2600
aVWow they have definitely nailed their sound. This Rocks.
p2601
aVOk, I'll have to be that guy. I didn't enjoy the vocals in Ecco, and this song didn't change it. Chon has always been about cool guitars and drums for me. Adding vocals didn't work that well in my opinion, and I hate to say this because they're one of my favorite bands. But, of course, I have to respect their decision. Almost everyone so far enjoyed this, so this is probably my thing.
p2602
aVI don't think Drew could make himself sound more bland tbh. And can we talk about how damn boring those lyrics are? It distracts way too much from the incredible instrumentals. Semesky grew on me with Intervals but I dont see that happening here unfortunately.
p2603
aVVocals aren't terrible, they are sort of "soothing" like the music. The lyrics are pretty awful though. Very generic love songy
p2604
aVNever said they were terrible! Just bland.
p2605
aVI agree with pretty much all of the above statements. I also thought that while the vocals were going on, the instruments kinda took a backseat role which threw me off a bit. They were just more open-ended and spacious rather than being a forefront, dynamic thing like on instrumental tracks. It wouldn't be so bad if the lyrics were better but it just seemed too bland. Don't know if anyone agrees, but yeah.
p2606
aVYeah, the same thing happens in Ecco. I really enjoy hearing difference in their playing, personally. 
p2607
aVI think that the vocals were fine and I enjoyed this song more than Ecco. At the same time I think it's cool to have some different stuff (because of the vocals), I still feel it's not at the same level of their instrumental tracks.
p2608
aVomfg\u000a\u000ahnnnnngggggggg I can't wait for this record to drop
p2609
aVChon can do no wrong it seems. I love this track.
p2610
aVGoddamn I love these guys so much.saw live at the music farm and they killed it
p2611
aVThis makes me so happy
p2612
aVIt's good, and I really like when the drums pick up a little bit. I wish the guitars weren't so tame. Still really looking forward to the album, hopefully a few more songs that make me feel like my guitar playing is worthless... 
p2613
aVJust released another track off the new album! Lots of vocals in this one.
p2614
aV&gt; another track\u000a\u000aWhere's the other one?
p2615
aVWrong flair
p2616
aVFixed
p2617
aVEven though I thought the vocals on Ecco were pretty decent I think that the vocals were much better on this track. They fit perfectly and didn't take away from the instrumentals but just added so much more to the song.
p2618
aVI don't know why but it took me until a full minute into the song to realize that there were vocals.
p2619
aVI hated the vocals on ecco, damn this sounds 20 times better.
p2620
aVCan't wait to get off work and listen to this on a computer with sound!!
p2621
aVCHON kills its with every song. If you don't like this because of the vocals then piss off. They have fantastic instrumentation behind it and either way vocals are just another instrument. Drew's vocals add so much to the song and are mellow as fuck. CHON are going to explode and become headliners.
p2622
aVRelax man. Just not my cup of tea vocally. I've heard many people say they don't like dream theater because of the vocalist. Never told them to fuck off  over it..
p2623
aVSeriously. And probably half the posts on this sub are people asking for bands without screaming. The same thing can be said for them, and nobody tells them off like that.
p2624
aVWas there any info released on if the vocals are in every song? I find them bland.
p2625
aVIf the other track Sumerian previewed is going to be on the record then there will be at least one instrumental song.
p2626
aVI actually really enjoyed this, and it is different from other songs. The last song released didn't do it as much (even though it was great, just didn't feel new to ME)
p2627
aVmmm
p2628
aVAm I the only one who has an issue with their clean tone? It sounds like a shitty clean tone in guitar pro or something. That's what bugs me more about woohoo and this than any vocals. 
p2629
aVMaybe its just because I am currently in a long distance relationship this song is even more appealing to me with the lyrics. That being said the vocals aren't suppose to be the focal point I am guessing. Its another instrument to give it that much more depth and feeling to the song. Nonetheless this song is really amazing and will be on repeat for quite some time.

aVYeah I thought it was an all around great album. It was an enormous task trying to live up to Dead Reckoning, but man the band pulled a great, although different sounding album.
p2635
aVHuh, I've checked out Kyrbgrinder and Headspace prior to now, but it looks like I might need to check out more of this band. Pretty good song.
p2636
aVI would recommend checking them out a bit more, but then I'm obviously biased. :-)\u000a\u000aIf you don't mind suggestions, check out this album, *Dead Reckoning*, or *Psychedelicatessen*. Their newest album has received some good press as well, but I can't personally recommend it not having heard it yet (although I expect it would be good).

p2648
aVI used to talk to him, the last I remember hearing was he was moving and I think he went to college? I don't remember for sure. The guy literally disappeared off of the face of the earth (internet).\u000aEDIT: I just checked, he deleted all social media. Really gone.

VKind of lame 1/3 of it is re-recordings. Looking forward to it though. 
p2658
aVI'm cool with that honestly. We get a super polished version of Perfect Pillow and 3 tracks from Woohoo! plus the rest are all new.
p2659
aVEven more disappointing to learn that 3 tracks are from woohoo, I'd rather have more redone versions of songs pre-woohoo...\u000a\u000aEdit:\u000a\u000aI basically agree with /u/FlyingSteaks 
p2660
aVWhen I saw that 1/3 would be re-recordings I thought "Cool, Perfect Pillow and O.G. are my favorite tracks", but Woohoo tracks? Ehhhh, should've been O.G. and Breathe in place of those
p2661
aVThey probably weren't able to make the song sound exactly how they wanted before this alum. I love when artists revisit works to improve them. 
p2662
aVI hate to be that guy but this is ridiculously "first world metal problems"\u000a\u000athey will be updated recordings and who cares, they are great songs
p2663
aVThe tracks from woohoo are just fine the way they are and don't need to be re-recorded, in my opinion. Woohoo came out last year, why re-record them?
p2664
aVIf I had to guess it was probably a decision pushed on them by Sumerian. 
p2665
aVI don't understand how you came to that conclusion. Bands re-record songs from early releases all the time, especially when the quality isn't up to their standards. I'm sure Sumerian would have rather had an entire album of new material to push instead.
p2666
aVexactly. and plus wouldn't you want some of your best composition on your first label release? \u000a\u000athis is a great example of the music fan and musician disconnect.
p2667
aVYour probably right\u000a
p2668
aV&gt; The band recorded and mixed the previous EPs in a matter of days, where as this time they had an entire month just to track. There's a couple tweaks in both of those songs that the band has incorporated over touring on the songs for a bit which are pretty rad, but no huge/major changes.  \u000a  \u000aThere's a feel change they play at the end of Knot live that I'm sure will be making it onto the new version.
p2669
aVI agree with this 1000% after waiting for over 7 years for a chon "full-length" they're only putting out 20 minutes of new material lol. the songs from woohoo were recorded only a year ago and sound amazing. The "those are their best songs" excuse doesn't really make sense to me, since all their songs are just fantastic. why not re-release "O.G" or "breathe"? now those sounds actually sound like shit (compared to anything from woohoo). I hope they at least re-recorded them and not just remixed the old woohoo recordings. 
p2670
aVWh...what? What the fuck does "first world metal problems" even mean? Don't try to compare judging music to some sort of economic thing. Doesn't work like that. 
p2671
aVI'm making fun of him for whining about such a trivial thing. it's a "first world problem" which means it's not a real problem.
p2672
aVKind of disappointed that all of the tracks are less than four minutes and there is a lot of recycled material. Also, it's barely longer than 30 minutes...how is this considered an LP? Might as well call it an EP.
p2673
aVTons of records are only 30-40 minutes. It's just not that common in metal
p2674
aVYa but 12 minutes is recycled material. That means only about 20 minutes is new material. Why not just make it an EP? I've seen plenty of EPs that are 30-40 minutes long (Clear, Restorations, Bilo 3, etc.)
p2675
aVLP and EP don't mean much anymore.  If anything, most bands use them as showing the importance of the recordings.  Many bands use LP's to signal the record as important points in their careers.  EP's are used more often as intermediary releases, or as minor releases that aren't as grand or important artistically as an LP.
p2676
aVWhich is why this should be called an EP...20 minutes of new material isn't exactly grand
p2677
aVBut to CHON it's the first work they are proud enough about to call an LP.  It's useless semantics.
p2678
aVCan't wait to hear the perfect pillow rerecorded! Not sure how I feel about songs off their last ep being on this album though :\u005c
p2679
aVI'm almost certain they'll be re-recorded, at least. Considering the vocals on Echo were flat last time around (which I'm cool with, they sounded great), I'm sure that will be re-done. Honestly hoping that a couple of the other tracks have vocals, too.
p2680
aVNot me,\u000a\u000aReally valued them as a fresh instrumental group and am disappointed to see them stray from that.\u000a\u000aSaw them play with Animals as Leaders this past year and they played great, hopefully they'll tour to support the new ep.
p2681
aVI would rather it not be a full time thing but I thought the vocals on Echo were the perfect fit for their sound, very low key. They'll be touring with Circa Survive and Balance and Composure for this release! [Here are the dates](http://lambgoat.com/news/24013/Circa-Survive-Balance-and-Composure-Chon-tour).
p2682
aVNowhere near me...shoot
p2683
aV&gt; Really valued them as a fresh instrumental group and am disappointed to see them stray from that.\u000a\u000aTell me about it, was so upset that Intervals became a band with vocals after how juiced I was on such an awesome instrumental band.
p2684
aVI think on their FB page they said something about their decision on moving forward with a new singer or not, so we'll have to wait and see.
p2685
aVWow I'm wondering how the Matt songs will translate live. I'm sure he is on the album to showcase his techincal ability. I'm excited to hear everything. Hopefully the rerecorded songs are a good choice, we will have to see. 
p2686
aVLots of people seem bummed about the rerecordings. Fair To Midland did this same thing and it was pretty cool to see how they evolved, the subsequent recordings of some songs were completely different.
p2687
aVI don't really get it. The songs they're re-doing are some of their best and I personally love to see the ways bands change their songs over time.
p2688
asVPinwheel - Reset (Sounds a lot like TOOL, imo)
p2689
(lp2690
VHmm. This is weird for me to try and assess. Don't get me wrong, I dig this and the Tool comparison really is inevitable. I also think that doesn't do them any favors. Sounds like a watered down version of Tools music. Like it's good, but because it is so closely reminiscent I end up just wishing i was lisening to Tool instead haha. \u000a\u000a\u000aI like the electronic influences though. Like Tool+adashofNIN
p2691
aVI don't know what to think of these guys. I like some of these songs including this one, but others were really just kinda meh. He does sound a lot like Maynard though which is awesome. 
p2692
aVThe album is called "Reset."  All of their songs are great in my opinion and very "TOOL" like.  I'm surprised I haven't seen them mentioned on here yet, and thought I'd register and share.    
p2693
asVLobotomize the Leader - Delta Orionis. Technically shouldn't be posting this because our albums not released yet, but what do you dudes think of this?
p2694
(lp2695
VIt's proficient. Sounds like you have the potential to write something interesting, but for the moment at least, I'm not hearing any new ideas. Seems like it's just regurgitated djent riffs at this point.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I'm a lot pickier than a lot of people. I want to hear something new, something I haven't heard before. That's what makes me sit up and pay attention. Not everyone's like that.
p2696
aVI'm siding with this, and bear in mind that this is me being particularly critical because you're new and you asked. \u000a\u000aI enjoy djent and this is some pretty good djent, but I generally don't get really into a band unless there's something particularly notable about it. I enjoy it, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back to it.
p2697
aVJust for curiosity's sake, check out the link I gave to the guy below and tell me what you think. I'm not expecting people to be blown away, as a matter of fact this is a better response than I had hoped because it actually is constructive criticism, so thanks dude! 
p2698
aVI'm really enjoying it. The riffs are sick and I'm loving that drum tone. I also appreciate how the aggressiveness in the drums. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine when drums in a djent song are just "bass drum on root note, snare on high note," so it was a breath of fresh air.\u000a\u000aLike I said, you guys are good, it's just that there are currently a lot of djent bands out there right now so it takes something unique to make me think "I want to spend my money on this as opposed to Animals As Leaders, Tesseract, Periphery, etc".
p2699
aVI get you dude, I feel the same way sometimes. It's hard to break that 4th wall that separate's a lot of the samey bands with the unique ones. I'm generally new to writing this way to be quite honest, its only been like maybe 6 months? In my bands next endeavor I plan to really go all out, which is also dependent on how this one does honestly. But I appreciate the feedback a ton!\u000a

aVI have been afraid to listen to this after listening to Language on loop for the last 2 months.        Is it comparable? Nearly as good?  \u000aEdit: Listened after all the recommendations, great album.
p2715
aVThey are very different. If you love Language that doesn't necessarily mean you will like Exoplanet. That being said both are very good albums, Exoplanet is just a lot heavier
p2716
aVYea i like the idea of what they were aiming for by "evolving" their music a bit, but in reality, i just can't get as much from intrinsic and language as i do Exoplanet. That uncontrollable beef.
p2717
aV[deleted]
p2718
aVLanguage is a great album and I've been listening to it at least a few times a week since it came out, but in my book Exoplanet is just on another level. Easily in my top 5 albums of any genre.
p2719
aVDid they lose a member since Exoplanet or something? Just really feels like an element is lost.
p2720
aVThey've actually *gained* members since then. After the bands' first two records (Exoplanet, Intrinsic) they changed their vocalist and bassist. They also got a keyboard player. So they in total went from 5 -&gt; 6 members.\u000a\u000aIf I remember correctly Jon Carpenter (Singer) left to be a dad/with his family.\u000a\u000aI think that had a large impact on their sound  - Mike (New singer) has a focus on harmonization with his cleans, with some okayish harsh vocals - which is a pretty drastic change from Jon's vocals.\u000a\u000aI don't know exactly why Chris Tilley (Old bassist) left.
p2721
aVI wonder how much influence the bassist had on the writing. Can you recommend anything with a similar style as exoplanet? I'd recommend no consequence, monuments and sikth if you haven't listened to em yet
p2722
aVI've heard Monuments and Sikth before, I'll check out the other band.\u000a\u000aAs for stuff similar to Exoplanet.... I have no clue. I think it's a pretty unique sound, I'm not sure what else I've listened to that's similar.
p2723
aVIn the Contortionist AMA last year they said Tilley left because he didn't want to tour/etc anymore... but there are no hard feelings with him
p2724
aVI don't think they're at all comparable. Personally I found Language extremely and totally disappointing. To each their own though. Exoplanet is a ***MASTERPIECE*** if you're into Heavier stuff, though.\u000a\u000aAmazing heavy grooves through out the whole thing, contrasted with beautiful ambient/instrumental sections, combined with super powerful vocals and lyrical themes - the human race looking for a new planet to live on.\u000a\u000a Definitely worth a front to back listen, or two ^or ^a ^few ^hundred.
p2725
aVSounds sexy, Ima listen tonight.
p2726
aVcompletely agree... you get it... and now i need some music recommendations from you.
p2727
aVI like most of Intrinsic, and I really love Language but people seem to love the shit out of Exoplanet. I picked it up and just could not get into it. Just too heavy IMHO. However people keep raving about it so I listened to it a few more times and now I dig it. If you want to listen to Language and you're pissed off, give Exoplanet a go. 
p2728
aVAlrighty, thanks.

aVDude, honestly, this is WHY people even like them.

aVUh, definitely. So tight live man.

aVI laughed a few times, but he was just weird.  Interesting stuff though, but no I won't be viewing more of his videos.
p2757
aVI randomly saw this a while ago as a suggested video after watching some guys video about a "Djentar" which was basically a long piece of wood with two strings and a pickup that he used in a song. After seeing that, this video hit several nails on the head about djent lol.  I felt the same way though, it was funny, but the guy has some weird ass mannerisms. 
p2758
aVYeah, he is trying too hard.  If he dropped the really awkward goofy faces he'd be more watchable.  But I will go look up this Djentar, I'm intrigued.
p2759
aVThat he does, but don't we all? :) \u000a\u000aAnd I assume you're referring to the [Djentstick](http://youtu.be/LhOYflyfOPM)? I saw that video a while back and genuinely wasn't sure if I should call it great satire or innovation haha.

aVHaha yep thats the one. When I first saw it, it reminded me of the instrument  [That One Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGMsOhaPJs) uses, but way less exciting.

aVThere are very few tech death bands I'd say I love, but this is definitely one of them. Never gets old.
p2792
aVI agree! I'm a huge fan of Joe Haley's guitar work, even though it seems to be a contentious subject other places on the web. It's fascinating to me that guitarists of his technical ability seem to mature into a preference for structuring riffs rhythmically instead of concentrating on flashy stuff. Vogg's work on the latest Decapitated record is another example of this trend. 
p2793
aVMy favourite thing about Pyscroptic for sure is definitely the guitar work, I don't get why it's so contentious like you said. I also loved the drumming on Blood Mantra.

p2811
aVI was like, wait, what happened to the video? What has OP done?
p2812
aVShame Brann can't handle these vocals live. 
p2813
aVUnfortunately with the way Mastodon usually uses their vocals in the context of Albums, especially Brent, it seems like it's almost impossible to replicate. It seems as though they really struggle with vocals on live performances. 
p2814
aVI've seen performances (all online mind you) where he can hit those high notes on the chorus. It's still about 50/50 but their vocal performances have overall improved drastically since the Blood Mountain years. 
p2815
aVStill impressive that he can at least hit the notes *and* drum like Animal.
p2816
aVBut badly. It's not that impressive when he does it as his job. I love the guy. I love the band but it's cringey writing something in the studio that cannot be performed live.
p2817
aVI'd much prefer to see them perform songs raw in the flesh than have them try to meticulously emulate their studio sound. 
p2818
aVI agree. But when it comes to horrifically out of tune vocals what else can I say? Don't see people attempting riffs that are impossible for them. 
p2819
aVActually for a while that's how Protest the Hero was writing some of their gnarlier riffs. The only difference is that eventually they learned how to play the riffs.
p2820
aVYeah. I do the same and a lot of people do. But they the learn how to do it properly before showcasing it. 
p2821
aVI tend to go easy on musicians who are doing extended tours. Singing like that night after night is exhausting (I speak from experience) and, yeah putting on a great show is important, but i sympathize with why one night might be rougher than the others.
p2822
aVVery true. But I saw them before their touring cycle had begun. I though it was just a case of not being used to playing it live but I guess not. I really wanted this album to push mastodon towards being European festival headliners in a few years to come but I feel this won't happen now. 
p2823

aVI may be in the minority here but this song doesn't do much for me. I love Mastodon to death, but, meh. 
p2832
aVSometimes things are popular for a reason, i suppose. I was on the fence about Mastodon for years until finally hearing Once More 'Round the Sun.  It definitely it put the rest of their catalogue into context for me, and this song is addictive as hell.

p2853
aVI mostly agree, but I see them in kind of a gray area. It's a pretty fine line between metal and rock in my opinion. Especially when you get in the category of progressive. 
p2854
aVI agree with you there. There's a lot of grey area with art in general, which is why it's so amazing. Nothing is clearly defined. Art, and music, truly is a reflection of who we are.
p2855
aVSo true. Glad we agree. I had doubts about Secret and Whisper fitting in this sub too, but I view them as *just* heavy enough to push it over the edge. This song just has a great powerful feel to it.

aVThis is seriously so fucking incredible.  \u000a\u000aI just....wow...\u000a\u000aI mean I fucking love Intervals, but who thought this dude could do this by just sampling guitars note by note.  I am blown away by the overall tone and riffs.  Fucking fantastic.  \u000a\u000aI'd love for him to have Aaron do a few solos/riffs in an album along with his sampling. 
p2886
aVAll three of his solo albums are free on bandcamp and he's been working on his fourth release too. Straight up honest, it's the only thing I've been listening to the past few months.
p2887
aVI'm going to be honest, I think anups work is a lot more exciting than intervals bar a voice within, because I think Mike really makes that album. \u000a\u000aAnup is clearly very talented, I kind of wish his solo work would get more exposure. Very tight, clean, mechanical yet rhythmic stuff. 
p2888
aV&gt; I'm going to be honest, I think anups work is a lot more exciting than intervals bar a voice within, because I think Mike really makes that album.\u000a\u000aI don't even know what to say to that....\u000a\u000aI'm going to pretend I didn't read this.
p2889
aVI still stand by that, but I'm curious why do you disagree? 
p2890
aVThe vocals were flat and uninspired.  I'm not saying they needed screaming per se (though I would prefer that) but they needed someone with actual range.  It was very boring, poorly mixed, and pushed Aaron too far back instead of letting him do his thing.  In Time compared to A Voice Within?   C'mon now....
p2891
aVI understand your perspective but I loved In Time and A Voice Within. I do love Anup Sastry's solo stuff the most. Butx I personally, don't really have an issue with A Voice Within.
p2892
aVI disagree strongly, I'm a big fan of Mike's vocals. The comment about his range is very valid, but then again i've found it fitting to the songs. It's a forgettable album but it's very enjoyable because of Mike, I've personally felt bored of intervals after listening to In Time and The Space Within after a few listens. So yeah, I felt they really needed that new level.\u000a

sVDaughters - The Hit. Not really prog, but definitely experimental metal. I can't really think of any band to compare these guys to.
p2944
(lp2945
VDaughters is the shit, it's all about Canada Songs, i think the spoken word is *cool*, but the old screaming songs fit the music so much better.
p2946
aVI am torn, but I think I liked ATSS much better.
p2947
aVI 100% agree with you.\u000a
p2948
aVI think Hell Songs is my favorite purely because of the story telling aspect of the lyrics. (Def in my top 10 of all time) But I'll be damned if I don't love me some Canada Songs and Live at CBGBs - Stupid
p2949
aVyessss, Hell Songs is most definitely my #2 for them. 
p2950
aVI loved the screaming too, and even preferred it, but I've now grown to like the drunken Elvis style. Feels like progression 
p2951
aVDrunken Elvis?  More like David Yow - Jesus Lizard/Scratch Acid, almost a direct rip off
p2952
aVThe guy has a lot to say so the bizarre spoken word style helps I imagine
p2953
aVThis stuff reminds me more of late 80's post punk and noise-rock bands like jesus lizard, halo of flies, steel pole bathtub, etc.  I like it for that reason though.
p2954
aVThat self-titled album was amazing.  I'm so bummed they broke up.
p2955
aVFuck yes! I fucking love these guys, I agree dude. I don't know who to compare them to but they're so good. I love Hell Songs.

p2976
aVI don't think it should be an issue. Everyone should know about Steven Wilson's contributions to the metal community through his session tenures and production. 
p2977
aVIndeed. I just put that because there's almost always some moron that wants to debate what is and isn't metal or what is and isn't prog each time I post something that isn't clear cut.

aVI haven't heard it in years. Takes me back. Thanks.

aVSo many good memories... this was the song my wife and I danced to at our wedding.

aVNo I wanna get married just so I can have some sick song play when dancing
p2981
aVI still can't get it past my head that Steven Wilson wrote a happy song. 
p2982
aVRight? It's fucking beautiful though.
p2983
aVI love this song and this album and nearly everything Wilson has put out, but you could have picked a heavier and (imo) better song off this album. Lightbulb sun, hatesong, Russia on ice.
p2984
aVRussia on ice.. man I haven't heard that in forever.  Going to go listen to it now.
p2985

VMan, how is it possible to have a (meaning one) favorite off of that record? I get goose bumps every second of every song when I listen to it. I got to travel to Atlanta, GA at prog power USA last fall and see them play it in its entirety, and jizzed my pants at least five times.\u000a\u000aTommy is just amazing.
p2990
aVThey also have one of the best bassists out there. 
p2991
aVThat and the clean piano through most of the verse riffs makes this my favorite song on the album.
p2992
aVYes indeed. It bums me out how this style of music doesn't get more notice. OTOH, it does make me feel part of a special club...
p2993
aVThey blew me away live. Break the Silence was one of the most intense live performances I have ever seen.
p2994
aVA great album by a great band. Does anyone have any word on what's going on with the new album? They've apparently been writing it but they've been pretty quiet. I'm assuming Tommy has been busy with Kamelot, but dammit I need me some Seventh Wonder!!
p2995
aVIt's unlikely to come out any time soon (ie. within the next year) due to them planning on releasing the Mercy Falls DVD, Tommy being busy with Kamelot, and Blomqvist just having another baby.

aV7strings4lyfe
p3041
aVIn that case, change my vote to Awake!
p3042
aVLove that album. Could be hard for new fans to get into though
p3043
aVIf they're from a metal background, show them Train of Thought.  If they're from a prog background, show them Octavarium.
p3044
aVI'm a bit of both metal and prog so which album by them combines both styles?
p3045
aVMaybe Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (one side is concept, the other is normal songs.  combines both about evenly), Images and Words (very melodic and catchy, but is also metal and prog.  one of the landmark prog metal albums), or Systematic Chaos (more metal sounding, but has prog arrangements and complicated music).  They're all different in that they combine both in different ways, but they are all good.
p3046
aVThanks!!
p3047
aVI second the Six Degrees. A Change of Seasons is phenomenal and a little closer to prog than metal. Awake is really dark sounding though the prog is a bit stripped down. Images and Words is my personal favorite alongside Metropolis, but it's really proggy so it may be a bit of an acquired taste.
p3048
aVI used to be a huge huge fan of DT (hence the user name). I absolutely love Falling Into Infinity, regardless of all the shit they went through with the agency while making it. Hells Kitchen and Lines In The Sand blow my mind every time (playing and listening). Images &amp; Words is a must, and another of my personal favourites is Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance (both discs). 
p3049
aVDo you still find DT enjoyable?\u000a\u000aWhat other ProgMetal bands can you recommend for me?
p3050
aVIf you enjoyed DT and you are looking for a new band to listen to:\u000a\u000aHAKEN.\u000a\u000aSeriously.\u000a\u000aH A K E N!
p3051
aVHaken is godtier!
p3052
aVI make it a special "date" thing. Lately I've been much more into Prog Rock, so it's like... It's DT time! And I head bang and sing like the good old days. \u000a\u000aA few awesome Prog metal bands I love are: Ayreon, Liquid Tension Experiment (instead of John Myung, they have the legendary Tony Levin on bass/chapman stick), Enchant, Queensryche, Symphony X, Tool, Angra.. Maybe also go back to one of the biggest influences: Black Sabbath.\u000a\u000aI can be of much more help if you want Prog Rock!\u000a 
p3053
aVDepends of what you liked the most in that album. I'd go for the older stuff like Images and Words since it has the first part of metropolis or Awake because it's very good. From the modern albums I'd go for the second disc of Six degrees or octavarium. 
p3054
aVI pretty much like ALL of DT's Discography EXCEPT When Day And Dream Unite and Falling Into Infinity
p3055
aVWhen dream and day unite is awesome. Try When dream and day reunite
p3056
aVThanks for the suggestion!
p3057
aVImages and words and octavarium
p3058
aVFalling into Infinity. It gets a lot of flack from a lot of fans, but the fact is, after listening to an album that is so interconnected, the lighter feeling of Falling Into Infinity is a welcome transition. It's serious, but not overbearing, with plenty of lighter moments musically. \u000a\u000aEither that or, if you enjoyed the theme of interconnectedness, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. It has strong motifs throughout the album and each song but has a lot of musical dynamic to it. Highly recommend.
p3059
aVI'm sure I'm alone in saying this, but Systematic Chaos was a pretty good album. Not on the level of Scenes from a Memory, but still good, especially In the Presence of Enemies. \u000a\u000aOtherwise, go for Images and Words, Octavarium or Train of Thought.

VI might cop a lot of flak for this but I saw Helm play last year and I thought they were exceptionally underwhelming considering how much they're praised in the local prog metal scene in my city.\u000a\u000aLack of an interesting stage show aside; the backing vocals were horrendously out of tune, all of the songs they played sounded extremely similar to one another and their mix was a muddy mess because they insist on having 3 guitarists despite none of their songs needing it.\u000a\u000aI've since tried to listen to their studio stuff and it just sounds bland and uninteresting.

p3124
aVam I the only person so far who thinks it doesn't even come close to P2...?
p3125
aVI thought that at first.\u000a\u000a\u000aThen riffs got stuck in my head.\u000a\u000aI actually saw them last night and was more excited for new stuff over PII stuff.\u000a
p3126
aVDifferent songs been stuck in my head for days now.
p3127
aVLast night was badass dude 
p3128
aVWas it just me or did they sound weak at first? Seems like their levels were off or something. 
p3129
aVNow that you said that, yeah maybe a little bit. I was having a hard time making out the guitars. Everything beyond that was on point though. 
p3130
aVYeah it got heavy as fuck once Icarus Lives was over
p3131
aV&gt;then riffs got stuck in my head \u000a\u000aThat's the thing, Juggernaut is much less of a prog album than P2.  Clear was a fun little detour, but by the time I reached Omega I was getting bored of the pop metal shtick. 
p3132
aVI'm not sure if I agree with that. Juggernaut isn't really pop metal. Sure it's got some poppy tracks, but so did PII (Scarlet, Ragnarok). Juggernaut is definitely a grower. I didn't care for it after my first couple listens. Somewhere in the last few days it sort of clicked for me. Now I'm finding little parts of songs all over other songs and having a blast with it. 
p3133
aVPeriphery will never shake that 'pop metal' label and it's because of Spencer's vocal style really. And to be honest, if you're not a fan of that, then you haven't been since they released their first album. I like your subtle pun too. 
p3134
aVhaha, glad someone picked up on that. 
p3135
aVOut of all the other way more applicable for that description songs off P2, you go with Ragnarok? That was like, the furthest thing from "poppy" on that album.
p3136
aVLol, yeah you might be right. The vocal part at the end just strikes me as poppy.
p3137
aVEh, fair enough I suppose. Haha. 
p3138
aVGive it time man. All Periphery grows on you.
p3139
aVI was actually disappointed the first time I heard the double album. Then, the second time around I found some of the riffs stuck in my head. The third time around, I found myself humming the tunes uncontrollably. Now, I really feel all the reviews that Juggernaut's got are justified. It very well maybe their best stuff, yet.
p3140
aVVery much my sentiments. I'm listening for these recurring riffs and themes, deciphering the story and trying to piece it all together.it's gets increasingly more fun. 
p3141
aVoh no, the youtube comments are full of people that argue over and over about how this stuff doesn't compare to P1 and P2 and so on and so forth. I can say unequivocally though that even though I really enjoyed both of those releases and their compositions, they literally don't hold a candle to this new material. Mainly because of how much their sound has shifted over the years. I find it hard to compare the previous albums even to each other let alone these two albums to anything that came before it. \u000aDifferent strokes for different folks though. :)
p3142
aVI like them both quite a lot, though I like P2 more.
p3143
aVI'm not a huge fan of most of P2. It's a solid, well-crafted album, but it's just not for me.I just feel like Jugg is a mix of the best parts of their previous albums. \u000a\u000aAlso,Spencer's harsh vocals sound really good, and his cleans aren't quite as irritating to me. \u000a\u000a
p3144
aVI really love Juggernaut, but I also like P2 *way* more. There's no song that immediately grabs me here like Ragnarok or Scarlet. It's a good album, but P2 is still their standout work IMO.
p3145
aVWho knows, I'm glad there is no definitive periphery album and that the consensus is quite divided across all 3 records. I personally think p1 is untouchable but each album shows growth, development and delivery on different levels
p3146
aVI've been like a vulture stalking it's prey, while waiting for these albums.
p3147
aV....[you?](http://www.metalsucks.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/protestthehero-volitioncover.jpg)
p3148
aVHehe yeah. 
p3149
aVVolition! 
p3150
aVI still cant get over how amazing the songs Omega and Stranger Things are. Omega feels straight out of a BTBAM Album, but with that Periphery catchiness we all know and love. And Stranger things is such a simple song at heart, but they do so much with it.
p3151
aVI really like one of Spencer's new vocal techniques where he just yells. He's not screaming, not growling, just straight up yelling his balls off. Listen to rainbow gravity for an example. My personal favorites right now are Rainbow Gravity, Psychosphere, Graveless, Omega, and Strange Things. 
p3152
aVMy personal favorites are Rainbow Gravity, Omega, Priestess, The Hell Below, and The Stranger Things. This album as a whole might be my favorite of all time, but I'm unsure of that. However from Priestess through The Stranger Things, it's definitely the best ~30Minutes of consecutive music I've ever listened to.
p3153
aVThere's no "THE" in those song names. Its just "Hell Below" and "Stranger Things"
p3154
aVWho cares?
p3155
aVJust letting you know... Before you get the wrong names ingrained in your brain. \u000a\u000aIts like calling Periphery "The Periphery".\u000a\u000aJust trying to help, didn't mean to come off as rude.
p3156
aVI love Misha and the Peripheries.
p3157
aV[deleted]
p3158
aVI love *The* Misha FTFY ; )
p3159
aVYeah my bad, my comment comes across as really snarky. 
p3160
aVI'm pretty excited for this release.  Ya know, I used to be one of those "Old Periphery" fans that didn't welcome their shift from Periphery 1 to 2 and I was worried about Alpha/Omega.  I started when there was no Periphery 2.  I started off on Racecar, so when the Icarus EP first was released, I heard Frak and had that raging erection but then quickly lost it when I heard Eureka and Captain On.  Then P2 came out which I still liked (now love), but something was missing.  Clear came out to which I initially thought was abysmal, now I love it.   \u000a\u000aBut then I sat down and said, "Yo I gotta stop being a fucking dickhead" and embraced their style.  I realized they never changed, they progressed.    \u000a\u000aI was just talking to my friend earlier today about The Bad Thing.  I love the lyrics.  The first verse "Sometimes there a crack in the world that I can peer through" and the second verse "Sometimes there's a hole in the earth that I can step through" both blow me away.  That concept sounds so fucking cool to me.  
p3161
aVTotally man. You get so caught up in wanting a band to sound like they did when you first fell in love with them but if they did you'd get bored because they would be stale. Periphery are always moving on and I love them for it. I must admit I struggled a bit when Opeth brought out heritage, but I'm all in with pale communion, so I understand where you're coming from.
p3162
aVI will admit though.. I really wish Periphery played Racecar on the regular.  I'm very lucky to have caught them on their Frak the Gods tour.  That was the only tour they played it and the way it's looking, the last tour they'll play it.  Hell, I'm lucky to have caught them with both Bois and Murphy in the band.  \u000a\u000aThey've come a long way and I'm very proud of them.  \u000a  
p3163
aVRacecar is a great song, but due to it's length, they could in the same space play 3 other songs that are also fan favourites, so I can see why they don't.
p3164
aVLet's just say your not really an old fan if you hopped on at Racecar. Lol.
p3165
aVWell actually it was Oxmodius and some of bulb's demos that got me started on them.  Actually, I didn't even know bulb was a part of Periphery back then because I just listened to songs off youtube's side tab.  Jumping from song to song.  But when I listened to their debut album, I listened to songs like Jetpacks, Light and Icarus to start.  And I was like, uhh, this sucks..  \u000a\u000aOne time I was listening to Itunes on shuffle playing Dead Space and Racecar randomized, and I was like Oh shit wtf is this??!!?  That's when I guess I considered myself a fan.  Which I guess still isn't that old of a fan.  But I tell you what, when I first seen em as opening acts there weren't many people there for them.      
p3166
aVJuggernaut may seriously be a contender for my all time favorite album. That's a really good take on the concept too, I've been trying to interpret the lyrics and your explanation makes a lot of sense.
p3167
aVIt was a very basic interpretation, I feel like there's some nasty shit that happens during Alpha that I didn't go into detail with but it all contributes to the increasing insanity of the character. 
p3168
aVJust saw them last night in Arizona. \u000a\u000aAh-mazing!! By far one of the best shows I've been to. I really am impressed by Juggernaut so far, especially seeing it really is the first album that the entire band has contributed to, rather than remakes of Bulb's old songs. 
p3169
aVThey fucking killed it last night 
p3170
aVSince you have the lyrics would you mind posting them? Or maybe take a picture or something? Mine hasn't even shipped yet 
p3171
aVI second this!
p3172
aVThese albums...they're incredible
p3173
aVThe albums definitely did not disappoint and I really like that Periphery explores music rather than cementing into one style. The only thing I dislike is some of the clean vocal lines. Spencer has phenomenal vocals, without question, and some of his best work is present on Juggenaut, yet there are times where it sounds completely out of place. It's jarring to hear one weird note when he sings one word, followed by a perfect phrase. Rainbow Gravity is an example after the beautiful guitar solo.  \u000a\u000a"Can we find a place where we can finally think for ourselves?" Really good. \u000a\u000a"We can fly. We can soar." The note he sings soar sounds so bad to me. \u000a\u000a"Staring in the face of what we chose to accept, but can't ignore." Amazing. 
p3174
aVYeah, I feel the same way. 95% of the time, I enjoy his vocals, but there will be a few moments, where I kind of cringe almost. But, as a whole this album is one of my favorites all time.
p3175
aVI know what you mean, 95% of the vocals are like FUCK YEAH! And there's just a couple of cringe moments. 
p3176
aV[deleted]
p3177
aV[deleted]
p3178
aVI would love this album so much more if I didn't feel as though Spencer threw up all over it. We get it dude, you can sing. You don't have to treat every song like its a fucking vocal solo.
p3179
aVHe needed a producer for this instead of doing it all himself.
p3180
aVThey said it was going to be a more vocal focused effort as a whole, and he's in a band literally comprised of producers. I'm pretty sure they're happy with what he did with it.
p3181
aVThis. To put it as someone did above, I feel like 95% of the time I'm cringing and 5% of the time I'm like FUCK YEAH! \u000a\u000a\u000aIs Periphery just not for me? :( I tried to give this release a fair shot, I really did. I've listened to it 3 times through now. But Spencers nasally all-epic-all-the-time-gasp-when-I-end-phrases vocal style really hinders my enjoyment of, what I think is, well put together instrumental work. 
p3182
aVSpencers vocals on the first album will forever be his best, before he got a big head and decided he had to go over the top with absolutely everything. I still love this band, and this is a great album, I just wish Spencer would re-evaluate his role in the band and realize it's not all about him.\u000a
p3183
aVI don't see it that way personally. I agree that his work is best on p1 however I feel that given Spencer's versatility and room for growth they decided as a band to push the narrative through him. And of course he's one of his own biggest proponents, but the final album really proves that he's almost as much responsible for peripherys success as Misha 
p3184
aVWe can fly. We can soar is actually pretty creative and cool to me. I'm suprised to see how opinions differ. Its actually interesting. 
p3185
aVI'd say that one line is probably currently my favourite one on the record! It's delivered in such a unique way and gives me chills.
p3186
aV[deleted]
p3187
aVI'd say you pretty much hit the nail on the head with the story line, although I'd say there's probably more to fill in for the Alpha section. Also the way I interpreted it on my listen through of Omega, I'd say he kills himself to rid himself of the pain, and then he is forgiven and ascends to holy air where he can finally breathe (possibly heaven?).\u000a\u000aBut yeah, your description is really good! have my upvote!
p3188
aVI agree with the suicide part.  All the lyrics in Graveless point to that conclusion, plus Hell Below is right after, so that'd be a perfect flow in the storyline.
p3189
aVMy interpretation is similar, but not exactly the same: I believe that the female character in Alpha is one of the "mothers bleed hung upside down", perhaps a satanic/cultist ritual where children are the goal: perhaps to turn them into demons, perhaps not. "22 Faces" is a clear reference to a book called Twenty-Two Faces, which actually tells about children who have been subjected to ritualistic abuse and because of that, they've formed new personalities and traumas. MK Ultra also seems to be speaking about children who are "forced into mind control" or corruption or so. I have to dig into this. I have to connect all the pieces.
p3190
aVEither way, mind control that is forced through ritualistic abuse seems to be one of the most central parts of the story. I believe that, in fact, this mind control might be satanistic possession, in Graveless it is mentioned that one of the characters (which is more focused upon in Omega) that he or she has felt Beelzebub all along within him. Perhaps the character has realized that he is horrid, and has done horrid things, and apparently commits suicide. Thus he or she falls in hell, but eventually - deserves another chance at life. "Demonic children" and ritualistic abuse on both mother and children seem very Rosemary's Baby-esque themes, and Spencer had just finished watching it when he started to wrap up the concept.
p3191
aVFucking. Shit. *
p3192
aVYOU CAN'T SAY THOSE WORDS ON THE INTERNET!
p3193
aVYeah man, that's like Internet 101. No swearing.
p3194
aVI'm sorry guys.. I've made a huge mistake. I hereby renounce my membership of the No Cuss Club. What I have done is unforgivable. The only thing left to do is commit ritual suicide to preserve what tiny shred of dignity I have left.

aVAs is tradition. See you get your affairs in order before hand, as not to burden your loved ones with the responsibility.
p3200
aVI really hate screaming and growling or whatever its called in music, but it actually works pretty well with this band. I feel like its balanced with the clean vocals, so the screaming doesn't overstay its welcome. Might be a good transition band for me.
p3201
aVTry listening to Hessian Peel by Opeth. Also a good balance there. I used to hate screaming/growling when I was young, it just took me being exposed to it for a while before it **clicked** and I loved it. It may happen for you too.
p3202
aVThat's exactly what happened for me too.  Periphery II was my transition album from hating screaming to loving it.  I just thought of it as an instrument and suddenly a switch was flipped.
p3203
aVI've listened to the album a few times through and I couldn't really piece the whole story together but from what I heard I didn't really get that story from the lyrics. 
p3204
aVI'm still waiting on my preorder in the mail for my first listen :(
p3205
aV/u/Kalzedar do you live on the west coast? Wondering when my pre order might arrive. I'm in Atlanta. 
p3206
aVI'm in Brisbane Australia
p3207
aVIt may depend on where you ordered from.  I ordered mine from KillerMerch, and I got it in the mail earlier today, and I'm in NH.
p3208
aVI got my double CD yesterday and waited listening until I laid in my bed in the evening. Just two hours ago I listened again, while riding bike. I actually took a bike tour just to listen to the albums :D\u000a\u000aAnd I love both. I think Juggernaut is the best thing Periphery ever did. It has everything I love in music. Dynamic songwriting with contrast in both the vocals and the instrumentation, amazing singing with great harsh vocals, a really engaging groove, some mathcore-esque riffs, some chillout parts in between, some catchy choruses(heavy heart, for fucks sake!!!), complex lyrics... I could go on and on about this record.\u000a\u000aI'd say this would be hard to top this year, but with releases from Slice The Cake, Xibalba, The Crinn, Ion Dissonance, Amia Venera Landscape, maybe Meshuggah, maybe Converge, maybe Dionaea, maybe Rivers of Nihil and more coming.... you know my point
p3209
aVIt might just be my interpretation, but doesn't the last line of the album (The skeletal mask brings forth the demon of the day) seem to imply that his repentance and acceptance into heaven was all a delusion?
p3210
aVThat's a good point I never thought of it that way. It would be fitting for the crimes (?) he committed.
p3211
aVOnce again I find myself late to the party but hey whatever. \u000a\u000aDude nice summary! I always thought the cultists let him go to do the demons bidding in the real world. So he became a killing machine. I figured by Reprise he has started murdering children in his demon-controlled state.\u000a\u000aYour explanation of Priestess (or the girl rather) really was awesome because that's the only song I couldn't figure out. \u000a\u000aAnyway I'd say we're at least 75% in sync.

aVWoah. So glad I clicked on this. Really digging the drumming here! I love it when the snare is used sparingly like this. And the off kilter interplay between the vocals and guitar accents is super tantalizing to listen to.

aVI don't know, that's sort of a weird question, or at least a hard one for me to answer.\u000a\u000aI really enjoy Adam Mayes as a vocalist, Craig Reynolds is a great drummer, more-so expressed through his work with The HAARP Machine, but his work with Viatrophy is great as well.\u000a\u000aI don't know what else to say really, except I enjoy their take on death metal and his song is interesting to me I guess?\u000a\u000aThis song is only a small taste of what this band offers.

aVI feel a bit bad saying this as obviously this is very technical, as is most glitch metal, and a lot of effort was put into producing it and such but.... meh. A fun one time listen, but it's far too sterile and chuggy for me to actually get in to. But then, I'm not the biggest fan of this form of djent/glitch metal so take my opinion as just that. 
p3233
aVYeah I don't think I could listen to an album back to front of stuff like this, there were just some cool moments in this song and figured I'd post it!

p3262
asVI've never listened to Devin Townsend, where do I start?
p3263
(lp3264
VSeeing that Hevy Devy is my favorite artist of all time, I shall be your guide on this epic journey! :D\u000a\u000a* Start out with some of his more recent works like *Epicloud* and *Sky Blue*. They're a good appetizer sampler for his many different styles and then work your way through the Devin Townsend Project series chronologically. *Ki* has wonderful blues elements and it's one of his more somber pieces. I secretly think it may be the best of the DTP series. *Addicted* is a pop-metal album with many fun tunes and is one of my favorites. *Deconstruction* is considered by many to his masterpiece, due to its technicality and lavishly chaotic nature; I love the album, but it's not my favorite. Last is *Ghost*. This record is nothing but pure beauty. It's probably my most listened to Devin Townsend record. Save it for last.\u000a\u000a* If you're in the mood for more ambient prog-rock stuff, then venture into *Accelerated Evolution* and *Synchestra*. Both are fantastic albums that feature Devin in a less intense environment, but don't worry, they still have quite an edge to them.\u000a\u000a* Or if you're digging his heavier side, then venture into Strapping Young Lad. I recommend starting with *City* and then going through the rest of them chronologically, as well. *Alien* and *The New Black* are standouts among these releases, but they're all great.\u000a\u000a* At any point, go through his solo albums, starting with *Ocean Machine*. They're all fantastic, especially *Terria* and the two *Ziltoid* albums. There's nothing Devin does better than an all-out, balls-to-the-wall rock opera.\u000a\u000a* Also, DO NOT FORGET about *Casualties of Cool*. It's a beautiful, very bluesy record that I cannot recommend enough for late night chill sessions or driving down lonely roads.\u000a\u000aEnjoy!
p3265
aVI got into Devin listening to Ziltoid the Omniscient. I saw him at warped tour with strapping young lad and will always remember the quote "I feel like 10lbs of ass in a 5lb ziplock bag. Fuck you!" lol. Depending on your tastes I'd highly recommend Ziltoid for comic metal genius, his guest appearance on Ayreon to get a sense of how insane his voice can be, Ocean Machines "The Death of Music", Synchestra/ Accelerated Evolution for pure Devin awesomeness, and of course the Ki quadrilogy with each album portraying a different aspect/genre of Devin music which all form into the whole of a fully realised genius musician. You will enjoy this :)
p3266
aV&gt; I got into Devin listening to Ziltoid the Omniscient. \u000a\u000aMe too, very good start I think
p3267
aVIn the time you asked this question, he released two more.  Better get started!
p3268
aVThe debut album Ocean Machine is pretty good to start with I think.
p3269
aVThe first 4 Devin Townsend albums are all great.  I guess start with the first album, Ocean Machine.
p3270
aVI was in the same position as you, only it was 4 months ago.[ I slowly got into Devin by listening to Epicloud from front to back.](https://play.spotify.com/album/3J2wQEjaJGCfStdLgKFgxl) It is a great album and I really do think you will like it. It's different from other prog metal you have experienced before, I think.\u000a\u000aHere's to hoping you enjoy Devin Townsend Project as much as I do now!\u000a\u000a[Bonus Song: Bad Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vLm5AetaZI) (recently posted here).

p3275
aVSynchestra, Addicted, Deconstruction - in that order.
p3276
aVI personally love his album Deconstruction just because it's insanely chaotic. The title track is wonderfully random and shows off the talent he has that he often holds back.
p3277
aVI started with Deconstruction and soon followed with Ziltoid(1). They remain my two favorite albums.
p3278
aVTough question, each one of his albums are quite unique. Personally, I started with Synchestra by pure happenstance and never looked back since :)
p3279
aVepicloud
p3280
aVI'd say ***Ki***! It's a very balanced and diverse album (but still totally coherent) where you can feel most of the facets of his art. 
p3281
aVHonestly if you're just looking for catchy and interesting, pick up Addicted and you won't put it down till you're done. If you want heavy and proggy as nuts, deconstruction.
p3282
aVIf you want to jump into the glorious madness at the deep end of the pool, while also getting a good sampler of most of his career, you can find the entirety of The Retinal Circus live DVD on Youtube.  It's 3 hours long, two sets, and is a 20-year retrospective on his career told as a piece of musical theatre narrated by Steve Vai, and complete with choir, dancers, and everything else you could want.\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/nBJ9U5m81PI

VDefinately looking forward for this one. But that being said I would love the start of a new PT project now.
p3288
aVNO plans for PT stuff right now, that was steven wilsons latest announcement
p3289
aVI remember reading something a couple of months ago about the possibitlity of new PT in 2016, or at least a plan to start writing then.
p3290
aVThere was an article recently of Steven shutting that rumor down.  In hindsight, the rumor might have stemmed from Gavin Harrison's new album of reworked PT songs coming out soon.
p3291
aVI found the article &amp; now that I re-read it, def not very reliable.  Shame.  At least there's plenty of amazing PT music out there anyway.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.metalinsider.net/news/steven-wilson-to-possibly-resume-porcupine-tree-in-2016
p3292
aVI'm looking forward to this album so much.\u000a\u000aI do have to disagree with this statement by the reviewer though : \u000a&gt;The second track, \u201cHand.Cannot.Erase\u201d is nontraditional for a Steven Wilson album as it is a simple 4 minute pop song\u000a\u000aSteven hasn't exactly been shy to delve into the pop music world. However Hand. Cannot. Erase. (the song) is certainly the poppiest he's gone since 1999 with Stupid Dream.
p3293
aVAnd even so, that song has a lot more going on that just being a "simple pop song."
p3294
aVAgreed. It seems odd coming from a reviewer who seems to have some knowledge of the PT back catalog that he would make such sweeping statements. He even mentions In Absentia and Lightbulb Sun which in themselves have some pretty poppy moments.
p3295
aVI didn't expect another album so soon. This dude is prolific. I'm looking forward to hearing it.
p3296

p3321
(lp3322
VI was going to mention a few newer albums by established groups that I think are being viewed too kindly based on previous albums, but then I remembered a few younger groups that have recently been sending people into insane frenzies. I nominate: The Contortionist, Ne Obliviscaris, Periphery and (God help me) Corelia. \u000a\u000aDo not get me wrong, they've all (except for Corelia) shown dramatic and mature progressions in their sound. I even think they've all (except Corelia) released some forward-thinking albums that could prove influential down the road. \u000a\u000aThat itself is probably *me* overrating them, but god damn if some people can't handle anything less than perfect praise of some of these groups. Also, I know some of these comments were made in jest or mockery, but do we need to proclaim everything "album of the century" 3 hours after it leaks?\u000a\u000aThey're great bands, but there is no way they can live up to the hype that's been surrounding them. Let's just all calm down and accept that they're not perfect and won't satisfy everyone. Not even Corelia. Yet. ^I ^take ^back ^what ^I ^said ^about ^them ^^Nostalgia ^^is ^^the ^^best ^^30 ^^minutes ^^of ^^life ^^ever ^^^please ^^^hurry ^^^on ^^^the ^^^new ^^^albums\u000a\u000a
p3323
aVI know what you mean when it comes to The Contortionist and Periphery. Good albums but not masterpieces. But the new Ne Obliviscaris was IMO the best album of 2014. Just saying. Also super hyped for Corelia! There is no way the new Corelia isn't in the top 3 albums of the year.
p3324
aVIf I didn't have a couple of darling favorite artists release last year I'd be right there with you, and in terms of extreme progressive metal that isn't djent or deathcore I do think they're leading the pack right now. \u000a\u000aAnd I don't think it's unreasonable at all to call something album of the year right away, especially since Citadel was released towards the end of 2014. I did legitimately see quite a few "album of the decade/new millennium" comments when it started streaming though. After spending a few months with it I still think it's definitely something special and a potential classic, I just cringe when I see labels like that applied before people have a chance to let stuff sink in.\u000a\u000aI'm both hopeful and apprehensive about Corelia. I know they had some drastic lineup changes that could affect the writing, and I'm honestly kind of worried about the double album thing. I think Ne Ob did it right by keeping Citadel at a reasonable length, because it's very rare for an album to go over 60-70 minutes without me getting fatigued by it. We'll see though!
p3325
aV&gt; it's very rare for an album to go over 60-70 minutes without me getting fatigued by it\u000a\u000aBoy, are you going to hate the next Potmos Hetoimos album. 
p3326
aVYou know, I've always kind of wanted to see someone attempt a legit triple album. Not a compilation, not a live album, not a soundtrack, like a band (or person in this case) just writing and recording a ridiculous amount of music. How in the hell do you pace something like that?\u000a\u000aThank you for mentioning him/them, by the way! I just listened through Recurrence and then a few tracks off of The Greater Gospel and I like the diversity I'm hearing. I'm definitely going to check out the rest of their stuff and The Paragon Trisagion when it's released!
p3327
aVYou could check out Kenn Nardi's Dancing With The Past. It's basically 20 years worth of material on 157 minutes. Absolutely massive, both in size but also in quality.
p3328
aVFirst thing I thought of was Periphery. They are extremely good, but Alpha/Omega is.... Just great? Its like a game made by Nintendo. Its supposed to be good, and it is, but nothing you haven't seen/expected before.\u000a\u000aI had no idea Contortionist was a band that got significant love, though. \u000a\u000aI hope Corelia's new album is worth all of this hype, because I will die if its a let down.
p3329
aVGotta say I don't understand all the hype with periphery. It's weird, I WANT to like them because I love the idea of a slickly produced meshuggah-sounding band but less heavy and with some clean vocals, but in actuality I can't stand Spencer's voice, and their albums sound extraordinarily overproduced to my ear at least. The drums at times sound more like EDM drums, to the point where it's like, why are they even trying to use acoustic drums and go through this whole process of compression instead of just using synthesized samples. And I like the guitar tones but even on monitors it's all muddied up by way-too-present bass kick. Don't get me wrong at times the writing excites me but in the end it's overshadowed by the emo vocals and EDM production.\u000a\u000aOn the flip side I can't say I agree about The Contortionist, I mean, I wasn't crazy about the vocalist on their first two records and the writing was a bit haphazard but they showed promise. I really do think with their new vocalist and Jamie King producing Language that they took a gargantuan leap forward and I'm excited to see what else they come up with. "Masterpiece" is definitely an overused statement just in general but IMHO they deserve some real credit. Also back to periphery, I know I was kinda shitting on them but it is really cool they finally put out a concept record, so just because I don't personally care for it doesn't mean they don't deserve props. I mean, lots of people definitely love their shit so clearly it has "struck a chord"....heh
p3330
aVEverything you mentioned is why I can't listen to Periphery too. 
p3331
aVI was absolutely ecstatic when I heard Mike Lessard would be joining them full time, and I agree that it's their best yet. It did take some time to grow on me, but I still think that a few songs meander a bit at points and could have been trimmed, even though the album's only ~45 minutes as is. \u000a\u000aWhen it hits, though, it hits. Thrive is possibly one of my favorite songs ever. Like you said about their previous albums, I think they're still a bit haphazard in their songwriting (Arise feels too quirky and off-kilter to me besides the B-section, and I tend to blank out near the end of Integration and the middle of Ebb &amp; Flow), but they're definitely realizing their potential more and more, and I think they'll top Language with the next album.\u000a\u000aAs for Periphery, I think you're spot on and those are all very valid criticisms. I just happen to love them for all of the reasons you described, haha! As much I like them, though, I think people do overrate them by treating them like they're above critique and objectively amazing. Thankfully, judging from your positive comment score the downvote brigades have calmed down.
p3332
aVThat's so funny! It's ironic because I feel like I sound/am trying to sound really "old" ("this stuff sounds different! And that's bad!!!) But as I said I love the concept of periphery but idk I guess the emo vocals just remind me too much of my awkward high school years when emo was so huge, or something. And the edm-esque drum production..... Whelp no psychoanalysis on that one so maybe I am just getting old!! Fuck
p3333
aVIt's not really a question you can answer really. I could sit here and say that Between the Buried and Me and Periphery are massively overrated because I don't like either of them and tons of people do, but that's not them being overrated it's just that I don't like them. The fact that tons of people do enjoy their music kinda shows they're not overrated, seeing as they're just stating their opinion.\u000a\u000aAs for underrated, give Gazpacho a try. Not prog metal really, more like a mix of Porcupine Tree and Radiohead. They're well worth a listen and I don't think I've ever seen them mentioned on reddit
p3334
aVI wish more people thought like you.
p3335
aVWhy so many downvotes, i thought it would be a good topic of discussion. :(
p3336
aVIt just promotes flaming and arguments.\u000a\u000aPerson 1:"BTBAM is overrated" \u000aPerson 2: "Fuck you BTBAM is perfect."\u000a\u000aIt just devolves into stuff like that usually. Not much discussion there. People usually leave what they don't like alone, until a thread like this comes and opens up that kind of environment.
p3337
aVOh ok, that's reasonable then.
p3338
aVI agree. Think this kind of thread helps bring some redditors back down to reality. Albeit, some become hostile and annoying.

aVJust being rational and realizing your favorite band may have flaws. and that it is okay.

aVOverrated: Anathema, Animals as Leaders (and related), Periphery, Protest the Hero, Between the Buried and Me, Caligula's Horse, The Contortionist, Destiny Potato (and anything Micic does), Haken, Intervals, Karnivool, Leprous, old Opeth, Trioscapes, The Safety Fire, Tesseract\u000a\u000aAll of the above (except Trioscapes and to some extent BTBAM) are bands that I really enjoy, many even being favorites of mine. But I think they are overrated, especially in terms progressing (vs. Progressive which is the genre) metal music.\u000a\u000aUnderrated or ignored by Prog community: Deathspell Omega, Blut Aus Nord, Abigor, Arcturus, Ulver, Krallice, Ved Buens Ende \u000a\u000aUnderrated: Unexpect, Estradasphere, Naked City, Spiral Architect, Soen, Shining, Save Us From the Archon, Behold...the Arctopus, Dysrhythmia, Biomechanical, New Cynic, New Opeth, Ephel Duath, Ever Forthright, Fantomas, Ihsahn, The Ongoing Concept
p3342
aV&gt;Underrated: ... New Cynic, New Opeth\u000a\u000aGood to know there's others.  Especially with the latest Cynic, the thought immediately after "yeah I'm digging this" was "a whole bunch of people are gonna be upset."\u000a\u000aAlso, Ulver needs more respect.  They stray pretty far from metal nowadays but its such intriguing music anyway.
p3343
aVa thousand times YES to Ever Forthright
p3344
aV&gt;Overrated: Anathema\u000a\u000aYou really think so?
p3345
aVBonus point to you sir, for knowing Fantomas
p3346
aVSince when is The Ongoing Concept prog? They play them on my local station... Just sounds like typical metalcore to me.
p3347
aVWell, they have a decently novel sound, as far as Metalcore goes, and they do the whole mashing of genre's thing way better than most (Metalcore+Ragtime+Western-style saloon music). Also, the last song on Saloon was fucking incredible for a closing song. Are they adventurous? A little, but they are up there with Periphery and Protest the Hero if you ask me and go beyond them by consistently drawing on one or two other sounds that really set them apart.

aVperiphery, AAL, Tesseract, Corelia - overrated
p3350
aVI don't think periphery is overrated (pre-clear) but I do think juggernaut is monumentally overrated
p3351
aVMost underrated: Headspace\u000a\u000aHow is this band not more well known in the prog metal circle? Damian Wilson's voice is pure sex, Adam Wakeman and Pete Rinaldi are probably the best keyboard/guitarist duo I've ever heard (keep in mind, that I'VE heard), and *I Am Anonymous* is easily in my top 10 or so favorite albums. Seriously, go listen to [Invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjFDvEMNGiY). Like, right now.\u000a\u000aMost overrated: Opeth\u000a\u000aThere's a reason I saved this until second. I've never been able to get into this band other than a select few songs, mainly because I feel like most of them are either a) the same death metal song with awesome guitars but overbearing growls, or b) the same softer song, that, while sometimes beautiful, get a bit boring after a while. Still waiting on the moment where someone shows me something that makes them click for me, but for now, I don't get them.
p3352
aVHave you listened to Opeth's newer stuff? Little to no growling if you're ever looking to try them again.
p3353
aVUnderrated: Threshold\u000a\u000aI don't think you'll find another band in metal even beyond prog that has put out such consistent quality music (songwriting, lyrics, etc) with as many line-up changes as they have while maintaining their core.\u000a\u000aThree great singers, too.

p3379
aVThis song is definitely different and less melodic, but every time I listen to it I get that feeling I'm a weird alien on acid, so this song is fucking amazing in my opinion.
p3380
aVThis comment made my head spin. Could you have worded it differently?
p3381
aVI said "least best" instead of "worst" because I actually think Leprous is a great and extremely talented band, so even what I perceive as one of their weaker songs is still pretty darn good. But I think the composition of this song is too...aggressive (in the chugging guitars and, particularly, in the "YOU ARE A WASTE OF AIR" vocals) compared to the complex instrumentation and vocal melodies/harmonies that I think make them great.
p3382
aVThey are indeed a cut above most prog bands these days. Can't wait for their new album
p3383
aVI dunno, the ability to periodically use aggression but not just rely on it is another thing that makes them great.  You get songs like this one and Contaminate Me (and the bonus track Bury from Coal) without getting burnt out on everything being really heavy.  Makes them more dynamic as a band.

Dream Theater's Metropolis Pt. 2 is about remembering past lives, so kind of like mental time travel.\u000a\u000aIron Maiden's Somewhere In Time was supposed to be a concept album about time travel at some point (or so legend says). Hardly prog but still a damn fine album.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, if you have the stomach for it, you could check out ELO's Time. At that point they were pretty much pop, though.

p3424
aVyes dude, this song is bonkers
p3425
aVHonestly, out of PTH's 4 albums, with the exception of one song (Reign of Unending Terror... don't know why. Just don't like it), I can't place a single song over any other single song. They are simply all within the best songs I've ever heard.
p3426
aVAs some one with a pit pug mix and friends with full pits, this song means a lot. They are not weapons or evil. They are the coolest dogs out there and I would get nothing but pits from now on knowing how sweet and loyal they are. 
p3427
aVI agree completely, especially as a pit owner. It's a serious tragedy that these breeds get singled out by society due to the minute amount of owners who neglect/train their dogs incorrectly that have had such on impact on the thoughts of others. Having only discovered PTH within the last two months (don't kill me), I am ecstatic that these guys are passionate about things such as this as well as the rest of societal justice they portray in their songs e.g.,  Tilting Against Windmills - another favorite of mine.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Grammar

aVAm I the only one who thinks the last really really good protest album was Fortress? Like, Fortress and Kezia, IMO they've been declining ever since. I miss the punk influence /:
p3431
aVI feel that, but for me it's more about thematic content. I miss the stories their songs used to tell. 
p3432
aVthat too, the social justice motifs the most. 
p3433
aVI think it's the lack of Arif. He was the primary songwriter on the first two albums (and lyricist, which have quite obviously only gotten worse as shown by this song - good message, but lacks the subtly that goes into making listenable lyrics), and it really shows. That being said, Volition was a step in the right direction after the disappointment that was Scurrilous. 
p3434
aVDef a step up, I agree.
p3435
aVI wanted to post this because this song is hilarious. Seriously, its satirical and ridiculous in the best way. Have you seen the video?\u000a\u000aI was really shocked to see people post on here that this is their least favorite song off Volition. They are entitled to their opinion and that's totally cool, but people were making comments like "A song about dogs, really?" Someone was actually offended with the line that compares dog legislation to German Crystal Night. Whooosh - this song is a joke! Have you seen Rody live?\u000a\u000aI like that Rody keeps it real and writes lyrics about relatively mundane things. I feel a lot of prog music lyrics gravitate to epic, or mathy, or space related lyrics almost on the edge of psuedo intellectual. Don't get me wrong, I love these lyrics too but Rody provides a breath of fresh air in the prog lyrics world as evidenced by the hilarity of this song. 
p3436
aVThis song is not a joke. No idea how you came to that conclusion when the lyrics very specifically send a message about a very real issue. It is in no way hilarious. Whooosh.
p3437
aVYeah it seems like he  totally missed the point of the song\u000a
p3438
aVYeah.. If anything Mist is the closest thing to being a "joke", and even then it's only because it isn't about a specific, serious issue. They just really fucking love Newfoundland. 
p3439
aVThere is almost nothing satirical about this song. It's about the widespread condemnation of an entire breed of dog that is based around how a small percentage of owners immorally raise their pit bulls.

aV#####&amp;#009;\u000a\u000a######&amp;#009;\u000a\u000a####&amp;#009;\u000aSection 2. [**Canada**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed-specific_legislation#Canada) of article  [**Breed-specific legislation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed-specific%20legislation): [](#sfw) \u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a&gt;The [Canadian federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada) does not regulate pit bull-type dogs, but one provincial government and some [municipal governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_government) in Canada have enacted breed-specific legislation banning or restricting pit bull-type dogs. The following table discusses a sampling of the restrictions in force.\u000a\u000a&gt;In *Cochrane v. Ontario (Attorney General)*, 2007 CanLII 9231 (ON S.C.), Ms. Catherine Cochrane sued the [Province of Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario) to prevent it from enforcing the Dog Owner's Liability Act (DOLA) ban on pit bull-type dogs, arguing that the law was unconstitutionally broad because the ban was grossly disproportionate to the risk pit bulls pose to public safety, and that the law was unconstitutionally vague because failed to provide an intelligible definition of pit bulls. She also argued that a provision allowing [the Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown) to introduce as evidence a veterinarian\u2019s certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull violates the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.\u000aThe presiding judge ruled that the DOLA was not overbroad because,\u000a\u000a&gt;&gt;\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;"The evidence with respect to the dangerousness of pit bulls, although conflicting and inconclusive, is sufficient, in my opinion, to constitute a 'reasoned apprehension of harm'. In the face of conflicting evidence as to the feasibility of less restrictive means to protect the public, it was open to the legislature to decide to restrict the ownership of all pit bulls." \u000a\u000a&gt;The presiding judge found the term "a pit bull terrier" was unconstitutionally vague since it could include an undefined number of dogs similar to the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.  The judge also ruled that the government's ability to introduce a veterinarian\u2019s certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull created a mandatory presumption that the dog was a pit bull, and that this placed an unconstitutional burden of proof upon the defendant. \u000a\u000a&gt;Ms. Cochrane and the Attorney General of Ontario [appealed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal) different aspects of the decision to the [Court of Appeal for Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario).  In *Cochrane v. Ontario* (2008 ONCA 718), the Court of Appeal reversed the lower court's ruling:\u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;* It agreed with the lower court judge in finding that the \u201coverbreadth\u201d claim failed because the legislature had acted on a \u201creasonable apprehension of harm.\u201d\u000a\u000a&gt;* It disagreed that the definition of pit bull in the Act was insufficiently precise and restored the original wording of "pit bull terrier" on the basis that, when read in the context of \u201ca more comprehensive definition,\u201d the phrasing \u201ca pit bull terrier\u201d was sufficiently precise.\u000a\u000a&gt;* It reversed the trial court and found that the government's ability to introduce a veterinarian's certificate certifying a dog was a pit bull would constitute proof only if the defendant failed to answer the claim: it was therefore a tactical burden, rather an evidentiary burden. \u000a\u000a&gt;On June 11, 2009 the [Supreme Court of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada) declined to hear further appeal of the case, thereby upholding the Ontario ban on pit bulls. \u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a^Interesting: [^Pit ^bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull) ^| [^American ^Staffordshire ^Terrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Staffordshire_Terrier) ^| [^Michelle ^O'Neill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_O%27Neill) ^| [^Staffordshire ^Bull ^Terrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_Bull_Terrier) \u000a\u000a^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+coydfno) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+coydfno)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

p3444
aV\u000ahttp://musicnotesblog.ca/2013/11/interview-rody-walker-of-protest-the-hero/\u000a\u000a&gt;RW: Well first of all, pit bulls are a mutt breed. And there are a ton of myths that exist that have been perpetuated by media. You know? It\u2019s just not feasible or right that they could ban and put to death any breed of dog in this country, and the fact that we have the largest territory in all of the world that does that \u2013 puts to death thousands of dogs every year \u2013 and this is put in place to stop dog attacks? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not doing anything at all. I\u2019m not just saying with this that we need to do away with the ban and wash our hands of it, because then nothing\u2019s going to happen. We have to look at Calgary\u2019s model. If you look at Ontario in 2005 when they put the ban in place, there was about 5000 dog attacks, or dog bites, sorry. In 2009 after all those years of BSL (Breed Specific Legislation) there was still over 5000 dog bites. Now when we look at Calgary, in 2005 they had about 2000 dog bites. In 2009 because of this new model that puts ownership more on the actual owner \u2013 there\u2019s higher penalties, it\u2019s harder to license a dog, it\u2019s harder to get a dog. There\u2019s education in the school systems. In 2009 they had just over 100 dog bites. This is a model that is in place and it\u2019s working. In Ontario, we have a model that\u2019s not only putting innocent dogs to death, but it\u2019s not working. It\u2019s costly and it\u2019s ineffective. It\u2019s costing tax payers more money than they even realize, and it\u2019s a myth! The girl who lived beneath me in the last house that I just moved out of has a pit bull. She has a purebred fuckin\u2019 American Staffordshire, and she\u2019s saying \u2018oh yeah well you know they have an air bubble in their brain, and when it pops they attack.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018you own this dog and you\u2019re spreading this lie. And it\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s all a lie! On the fuckin\u2019 American Temperament Testing Society they rate, I think it\u2019s 84.7 percent pass rate. This is just a dog like any other. Of course there are some vicious ones but there\u2019s vicious bichon frise. Every animal, including human beings has this tendency that there are vicious ones of us all. And I mean, it\u2019s no different with dogs and I think something has to be done about dog attacks with BSL, it\u2019s just the exact wrong thing. Also, it affects a lot more dogs than we even realize. Because it is a mutt breed \u2013 there is no just \u2018standard pit bull\u2019 \u2013 the definition of a pit bull or a bully-type breed in Ontario is medium sized, short hair, short snout, large brow. That\u2019s a boxer, you know? That\u2019s a ton of different dogs, none of them are necessarily pit bulls. That effects more people than we even realize. It certainly affects some people very close to me, and I think it\u2019s an incredible injustice.\u000a\u000a&gt;MN: Is that what inspired you to do all this research and become well-spoken on the subject?\u000a\u000a \u000a&gt;RW: I suppose so, and also I rescue animals, and I would like to start fostering pit bulls hopefully when the ban is lifted to attempt to lift the stigma. My girlfriend and I adopted a dog last year, and she\u2019s just the greatest. We want to remove the stigma not only from adopting animals but from pit bulls themselves. A lot of people think \u2018oh, when you adopt a dog you can\u2019t have the kind of dog that you want, and they come with problems and you have to sort them out\u2019 and it\u2019s like \u2018sure, that might happen\u2019 but you can pick any dog because there\u2019s hundreds of thousands of dogs who need homes. What really needs to fuckin\u2019 happen is breeding needs to become illegal. These fuckin\u2019 assholes that are like breeding these animals that there is an abundance of in the wild are terrible people. I don\u2019t care if they fuckin\u2019 go out of their way to be nice or be wonderful in a social setting \u2013 this is a fuckin\u2019 injustice. I think breeding is some of the worst shit you can do. I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve experienced it \u2013 I\u2019ve been to a breeder\u2019s house and it\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s greasy as a skillet and I don\u2019t care nice they are, they\u2019re bad people. *laughs*

p3469
aVI still think their self titled was their best, since it was a bit more of a raw demonstration of pure guitar work how-the-fuckery.  I do like this album 2nd best as it's a bit better blend of their first and 2nd albums, since after my many....many re-listens to Weightless, I've started to think they did a bit too much of the synthesized and offbeat clean stuff and that fell away from the groove of the album as a whole.  Joy of Motion really has a fantastic groove throughout, and doesn't have any low spots.

Dude doesn't burn out like a lot of singers seem to.)\u000a\u000aCynic (their newest album aside, and maybe Re-traced, they used a lot of vocoder vocals. Even still, Masvidal does have a very soothing style of singing and keeps a nice, soft tone)\u000a\u000aDiablo Swing Orchestra (styles of singing covered: opera, swing/jazz, and more all with two singers, I think)\u000a\u000aMike Patton (pretty much everything)\u000a\u000aDaniel Gildenlow (again, pretty much everything, but I would start with The Perfect Element Part 1)\u000a\u000aDisperse (kind of similar to Masvidal's style, but with more 'oomph' at times)\u000a\u000aEstradasphere (pretty much everything)\u000a\u000aThe Great Gamble (A Bass/Baritone singing Dream Theater/Symphony X style vocals over similarly styled music)\u000a\u000aSymphony X (Russel Allan is a beast of a vocalist, vocals ranging all across the normal Baritone range and from gravelly and demonic to clear and angelic)\u000a\u000aIhsahn (black metal styled harsh vocals and cleans that are somewhat reminiscent of Masvidal, in that they are quite soft compared to many other singers, but can be powerful when need be)\u000a\u000aKamelot (Siege Perilous-Poetry For the Poisoned since that is the era of Roy Khan who brought a kind of poor-man's Warrel Dane style, though he is no slouch)\u000a\u000aOrphaned Land (very Middle-Eastern tinged music from THE Israeli Prog Metal band and the vocals have the same tinge to them)

aVBro, if you love Fair to Midland, you have to give [Rishloo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtgOEKrd2EE) a try. Andrew Mailloux's range is on par with Darroh's, and even outshines him in certain places. This is coming from someone who idolizes Darroh as well :P\u000a\u000aAs for other "unique" vocalists go, hard to sift out, but out of thos that haven't been mentioned, you've got [Dream the Electric Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-juOIqUAQNA) (higher register that sounds a little like the previously mentioned Children of Nova), [Headspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwNw4XLYpKQ&amp;spfreload=10&amp;noredirect=1) (grandiose style, Damian Wilson is a house, also sings for the band Threshold), [Cog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmo-I9wBmjM&amp;spfreload=10) (punkish, Flynn Gower wasn't even supposed to sing for them, oddly enough), [Eden Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbDith4ymNY&amp;noredirect=1) (gravelly, I think of Death Cab for Cutie sometimes for some odd reason), and [Anubis Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFXTwxzJdn4&amp;spfreload=10&amp;noredirect=1) (another "grandiose" vocalist, with a German flair).
p3531
aVI've given Rishloo a few listens, and I really enjoy them. The vocals feel like a combination of Maynard from tool and Darroh. I just wish Mailloux did some of the throat singing that Darroh does. Dream the Electric Sheep are really interesting, both vocally and instrumentally. Headspace is amazing, his vocals blow me away. Eden Circus was good, but didn't wow me. I already love Anubis Gate, so I'm always glad to see someone mention them.

aVTry [Means End](http://meansend.bandcamp.com/).\u000a\u000aI don't know much about classifying vocalists but the vocalist's style doesn't have that poppy element you find in Periphery or Intervals.

p3556
(lp3557
VThis is from one of the many overlooked albums of 2014, The Whisperer, by the British band Spires. The sound is somewhere between Ne Obliviscaris and older Opeth and Imagine fans of either will enjoy this a great deal. \u000a\u000aI hope I don't spoil anything when I say it's a really damn good album.

VIt seems like he has to do this every year. People need to quit making shit up already.
p3562
aVThat. Sucks.
p3563
aVIt sure does. I do love his solo stuff and seeing him on the Raven tour was incredible. But I'm always going to be hopeful for a new PT release
p3564
aVTBH, I don't really like his solo stuff. But I'd rather PT goes on hiatus and comes back strong in a few years' time.
p3565
aVA lie becomes truth very easily when people want to believe it as such.  Porcupine Tree doesn't owe anyone anything but I hope they make another album.
p3566
aVIf you listen closely, you can hear the soft sounds of my dreams being crushed.\u000a\u000aBut really, I thought he was pretty upfront about not doing a PT album for a while.
p3567
aVDamn. Gonna miss porcupine tree. 
p3568
aVI miss them being a full time outfit too, but at least he says it's possible they may do something in the future. While it sucks Porcupine Tree is on the back burner indefinitely, that he says it's not done/broken up permanently is a positive at least. Plus we've got more of his solo music to look forward to, which is certainly not a bad thing.
p3569
aVTrue. Their solo stuff is pretty good too.
p3570
aVI find myself listening to his newer stuff more than his PT stuff lately. Though I could probably listen to him banging randomly on a toy xylophone and be happy.
p3571
aVHe's really been so abundantly clear about this so often that it irks the shit out of me every time news of his gets posted and half the comments are "OMG WHEN'S PT COMING BACK"\u000a\u000aWhen he wants to do something with PT, he'll say something.  He's a pretty blunt and forward guy.

(lp3582
VI'm giving you an upvote because I clicked the link and I really liked it. They're a band I've been meaning to check out for a while and I'm very impressed. However, by no stretch of the imagination would I consider this metal.
p3583
aVPart of the reason I love this sub is that we *can* post some stuff outside of metal as long as it's halfway relevant. All the other music subs take themselves way too seriously.
p3584
aV&gt; A place to discuss music and anything else related to progressive metal.\u000a\u000aFrom the sidebar. Most people would not consider Porcupine Tree or Steven Wilson "metal", but they're still posted and discussed here because there's a huge overlap between their fans and fans of "prog metal". If it appeals to the majority of the sub's user base while still being at least tangentially related, I think it definitely has a place here.
p3585
aVRight on the nose.
p3586
aV[deleted]
p3587
aVAgreed! Also your flair is super awesome. \u000a\u000a\u000aSo I had never really listened to these guys before now and I have to say I'm loving what I just heard. Couldn't help but think of BTBAM during that quirky swing kind of mid section that happens right after the sweeping chorus. Really original sound. Thanks for sharing, OP! 
p3588
aVYou might enjoy 'The Color Spectrum' - that album was my first Dear Hunter experience and it absolutely blew me away. It's a really diverse set of songs, grouped by "color", that span multiple genres (the songwriting is out of this world). Fair warning though, it's 2.5 hours so prepare for a long journey hahah.\u000a\u000a[YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exc2YeRjm_8)\u000a
p3589
aVTheir songs do vary quite a bit. They tend to be more rock than metal. One of their songs a bit closer to metal would be [In Cauda Venenum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je0iLECqtAA), but that's been posted here before. 
p3590
aVThey definitely have some music that gets fairly heavy. 
p3591
aV&gt;However, by no stretch of the imagination would I consider this metal.\u000a\u000aPeople need to lighten up about this, and it's not just this sub. The fact of the matter is that many genres overlap and present qualities that line up well with those we enjoy in ours. I find that I most appreciate these subs during posts like this, where someone introduces something outside our box into the mix, with an understanding of what it is about music in general we like. I guess some people hate fun but still...
p3592
aVBy no means do I hate fun, generally speaking I have no qualms with these kinds of posts, after all I did just find a band I have just become a little bit obsessed with because of one. But I guess I pointed it out, because, errrr, I dunno, it wasn't keeping with the theme of the sub? Could be a good idea to list non-metal suggestions under a separate flair though?
p3593
aV&gt;Could be a good idea to list non-metal suggestions under a separate flair though?\u000a\u000aI think this is a great idea. There should *definitely* be a flair for what amount to musical cross-posts. 
p3594
aVHave you been listening to them now? I love their Act II and III albums. Just barely bought The Color Spectrum and it's been a great album to listen through as well. 
p3595
aVMy absolute favorite TDH song. Have an upvote good sir.
p3596
aVThis is my anthem during autumn. It's like the perfect song to listen to while walking in the woods with all the warm colored leaves falling down around you.

aVMan, I love me some Casey. \u000a\u000aNot progmetal at all, but [this cover of Unison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCYithIw1g4) by Bjork is solid gold.\u000a\u000aThe man has an incredible vocal range. Always wished he would join up/ start a metal band but TDH is pretty awesome as it is.

p3618
aVIf you can make it, do it. As I said before, their last concert was the best of my life. I listened to their stuff beforehand for a while and liked it, but was not blown away by it. Then I saw them and they became my favorite band. It's amazing how different their songs feel live. The ups and downs of their songs are so much more real when the crowd around you goes wild.\u000a\u000aOn another note: Amazing acoustic version of "The Last Few"  \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lzdZxx1Cw4\u000a

VI got this album (Roads to the North) recommended by a friend the other day and was immediately impressed. It's a kind of bluegrass-infused post-black metal. [Capricious Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SIbKRZFmYU) is perhaps the proggiest song on the album but it's also part of a three-song cycle and I believe it sounds even better when listened to in that context.

p3686
aVIf you like Dillinger, you'll probably like the songs i like from Converge, since i tend to enjoy the fast and intense stuff. I've only heard Jane Doe &gt; present. All of Jane doe is really good, but it's not for everybody. You fail me is pretty good check out [Drop out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hcUxV7BmSc). I don't like much of no Heroes at all, but the [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hcUxV7BmSc) is pretty dope. Axe to fall is maybe the slowest album. I'm sure others will disagree. The first track, [Dark horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9wZDd_GgPs) is awesome though. Finally, their newest album, All we love we leave behind i really like. Especially the [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiALoVqzAVo) and [aimless arrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrcY9I-BbjM).

p3705
aVI've been really trying to get into bands like this. I haven't been able to get into the black metal type vibe yet. Bands like Intronaut, Anciients, and this are something I'd really like to get into.
p3706
aVHmm I'm not sure I'd classify this as black metal. Actually, I'm sure of it. But if you're looking to get into Intronaut either Valley of Smoke and Habitual Levitations are more accessible than their earlier works and I love both of those albums dearly. If you're into groovy, polyrhythmic music, Intronaut should be a sinch to dive into. If  that's not your bag, I'd look elsewhere. \u000a\u000aAnciients, to my knowledge, only has one album but I was never able to get into it. Though I admittedly never tried very hard, and I probably should as I've heard their sound is heavily Opeth influenced. \u000a\u000aAs for this band, and all progressive metal in general, I simply suggest giving songs and albums multiple listens before trying to assess how you feel about the music. Give it a chance to stick. It takes a while for patterns and melodies and arrangements to sink in with this kind of music, but that's why i love it. \u000a\u000aWho are some of your favorite metal groups? 
p3707
aVYeah, Black metal is probably the wrong term. But, the bands kind of share a certain sound that's really interesting that I haven't had the chance to dig into yet. \u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aMy favorite bands are:\u000a\u000aProtest the Hero\u000a\u000aSymphony X\u000a\u000aCorelia\u000a\u000aPeriphery\u000a\u000aThe Helix Nebula\u000a\u000aIntervals\u000a\u000aThose are the bands I listen to most often.

aVI think it has to do with chart placement more than anything, because that helps a band in multitudes of ways. The more successful the album, the more interest from promoters.. This more shows, bigger tours, wider audience, more $$$ for the band and more potential $$$ for the label.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion: BUY THE ALBUM GUYS
p3734
aVYeah pretty much that.  The better your album performs in the first week (and with general sales) the better tours, opportunities and guarantees you will be offered.  So preordering or buying our album in the first week benefits us over the course of the entire album cycle!
p3735
aVPre-ordered 2 weeks ago, can't fucking wait!! 
p3736
aVWill head out and get my copys on the 26th. Really excited, clear ep was one of the best releases of last year! 
p3737
aVSo anychance your Australian fans can have a way to stream the album? Most songs simply give us the "Sorry, video not available error"...  I know roadrunner hosted a few songs but i cant find a playlist of the whole albums uploaded by roadrunner. 
p3738
aVIf you're using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as your browser, download the "Hola" extension. It's free and lets you browse from a huge variety of different regions. I live in Canada and it gives me access to American and British Netflix... I'd imagine you would have a similar result with a stream.
p3739
aVThankyou! This extension will actually solve alot of region locks ive been increasingly running into. 
p3740
aVHonestly, the region locking has made this release really fucking unpleasant for AU/NZ.\u000a\u000aI can't listen to an Alpha stream anymore.\u000a\u000aThat was really the only unpleasant part though, because the music itself is so good. It'd just be nice if I could hear it with the rest of the world.

aVMan, Periphery is back. That's all I have to say.
p3751
aVYou're one of those people I always upvote just based off of flair.
p3752
aV:D!
p3753
aVWow. After listening to the only released ones on repeat constantly(The song Omega is incredible), this is AMAZING. Hats off to Periphery for making such sick music!
p3754
aVI already put in my preorder, but I always loved how Sumerian puts albums up for stream before release date. I about shit myself when I saw they put Life In Lucidity up before I even had it in my hands last year.
p3755
aVI love The Kindred, I got to see one of their first shows after their album released so it was awesome listening to them, but they didn't get to play enough before BTBAM, Intronaut, and Deafheaven
p3756
aVGreat group of guys. They got my girlfriend and me backstage access, and watching Blake play drums while standing 10 feet away was fucking surreal.
p3757
aVSimply amazing. Everyone did their job to perfection and the album flows so well. Psychosphere might be one of my favorite songs ever (that riff at the end, tho). 
p3758
aVIt MIGHT be the record holder for grooviest riff of all time.
p3759
aVThis song really shows Spencer's range well, he absolutely crushes this track.

aVHOLY FUCK MK ULTRA.
p3766
aVMK Ultra is so fucking good!
p3767
aVheavy heart was awesome
p3768
aVI like their new sound. I'm truly glad it wasn't 'Periphery 2' 2, because if it was I would have grown tired of it faster.\u000a\u000aWow, I said this about a few songs, but seriously: at parts, Heavy Heart's vocals sounds EXACTLY like something from Coheed and Cambria (namely In keeping secrets). I like it, but it will take getting used to in a few parts. \u000a\u000aThe only song that I don't adore yet is MK Ultra (It's SO P1 but it will take a while to grow on me). Favorites would be Heavy Heart, Rainbow Gravity, Psychosphere, and the 3 pre-released tracks.\u000a\u000a
p3769
aVI'm so conflicted if i should click this or not right now. Got the album and hoodie in the pre sale and wanted to wait, but i'm so weak.
p3770
aVWhy would you wait? You've literally already paid for it and they're telling you to go ahead and listen to it early.\u000a\u000aPlus you could die tomorrow.
p3771
aVNever seen a better argument in my life. 
p3772
aVI got the double t-shirt preorder pack. Clicked. Did not regret.
p3773
aVCurrently on my second listen through. This album honestly blew me away, and I'm even more excited to figure out the story. There's something about the darkness and depth to the songs that makes the concept even more engrossing to me. Yay for graphic novels
p3774
aVHmmm. As some one who is not a fan of Peripherys past releases, this has actually surprised me a little bit. I'm still not a fan of Spencers vocals (a statement hang worthy around here, I'm sure) as I find them quite over bearing and over the top, but the instrumental work in this has me more intrigued than anything they've released before. I can't say Iove every song here, but there are shining moments that may have me coming back... 
p3775
aVAs much as I love Spencer as a vocalist, I have to agree with you. He can be so over the top sometimes. Like His Work on P1 was sick because it was mostly his screams mixed with his great cleans and it was super interesting. On these past few releases though, I feel like Spencer has taken over the band a bit. Their songs no longer have that raw, guitar fueled sound of their first album, Spencer has shifted their sound to a much more poppy upbeat feel. Every song he sings, his vocals go so over the top that sometimes they just get distracting to me. It seems like Misha has simplified his guitar playing a lot to allow Spencer to be the focal point, And I feel like they lost a lot of technicality and sacrificed it for Spencer's catchy-ness.\u000a\u000aI still love this band, and will continue to buy everything they put out and enjoy it, I'm just sad that Spencer's vocals have become so predictable. When you go so over the top for everything, it all just becomes bland.
p3776
aV[deleted]
p3777
aVThis is spot on what my friend and I have both been thinking but couldn't formulate into words.. I hope Bulb does more solo work again.
p3778
aVMy two biggest complaints about periphery, and what has always kept me from really being a fan, are: 1) The tones are occasional so far down the digital rabbit hole that they sound extremely brittle and 2) Spencer's vocals just sound juvenile and out of place in the world of metal.\u000a\u000aBut I've always LOVED the instrumental portions of Periphery's music, from a compositional foundation anyway. I think Misha is capable of brilliance.\u000a\u000aTwo things I'm noticing about this record: 1) The tones are much more beefed out and professional sounding. This doesn't sound like your typical "my band is really influenced by Periphery and we recorded this djent song in my bedroom!" which ironically Periphery has always kind of sounded like. I guess they've been guilty of caricaturing their own style I guess. Over-reliance on digital processing to make up for a poor acoustic recording environment can do this kind of thing to a record. But on THIS recording I feel the weight of the guitars a LOT better. 2) Spencer's over-the-top melodrama is toned down a lot. Still not really a fan, but it's not nearly as over-bearing as it's been in the past and it sounds like his balls are finally starting to drop so there's that...\u000a\u000aIf they continue in this direction I might be a fan.
p3779
aVThat might have something to do with the fact that it wasn't recorded in a bedroom and they actually rented out a studio space this time around.
p3780
aVIt shows.
p3781
aVAnd they actually used cabinets :O
p3782
aVAll the tones are still made with their AxeFx units, but I agree that the sounds are very good. Nolly's mixing and production on this album is top notch. 
p3783
aVYeah there a definitely a handful of awesome parts that I love, but there are also a few songs that seem totally bland to me. I felt the same way about PII at first, but then it grew on me, so hopefully that will be the case with this one.\u000a\u000aI'm with you on Spencer's vocals. He's incredibly talented and writes some great vocal lines, but there's a nasally aspect of his voice that I can't stand. It's okay for the most part, but on some of the trickier vocal parts it really stands out. On the other hand, his growls have gotten sooooo good.\u000a\u000aDefinitely going to have to give this 10+ listens before I can form an complete opinion though.
p3784
aVwow, this is going to be the best album of 2015 and 2015 just started. So much awesome.
p3785
aVYou forget that BTBAM is releasing an album this year. 
p3786
aVAnd Intronaut.

p3801
aVSo what you're basically saying is you can see approximately 1 year into the future? Can you give me next week's lottery numbers please?
p3802
aVHonestly pretty underwhelmed by the whole thing. I'm definitely going to give it many, many more listens, but it isn't blowing me away right now.
p3803
aVthis is only alpha, we are still missing omega.
p3804
aVYeah... Periphery I &amp; II were instant favourites for me. Here I'm liking a few parts; a few songs but I'm not amazed yet. It'll be on repeat for a while indeed.\u000a\u000aEdit! Eh, 3rd / 4th listen it's really starting to grow on me. I'm really enjoying the atmospheric / ambient feel on the record in a bunch of the tracks. Heavy Heart, Rainbow Gravity + Hell Below, Omega, Stranger Things are my top tracks thus far. 
p3805
aV[deleted]
p3806
aVI am with you. I listened through it once(both a&amp;o) and started again and noticed towards the end of the second time through I wasn't really paying attention anymore. I'll keep trying though. It's not bad...just not really what does it for me. 
p3807
aVSame here. There are definitely a few gems, I'm really enjoying Priestess, Hell Blow, and Heavy Heart. I don't think Alpha really stands out by itself, whereas Omega is definitely interesting. I do think it's probably a bit of a grower.
p3808
aVWhere are you guys getting Omega?
p3809
aVGoogle, can't post links here.
p3810
aVFair enough, I can just wait for my pre-order haha
p3811
aVOh good, I'm not crazy. They sound great, but everyone raves about their music and I always need to force myself to turn on one of their albums to see if maybe this time it will finally click. I wondered if it was because I'm not a musician myself so maybe something just pass by my notice that are really amazing if you know what they are actually playing, but every time I turn on Periphery my mind wonders, it just doesn't engage me. 
p3812
aVyou haven't even listen to the whole album
p3813
aVReally? I actually have.
p3814
aVNot Omega. So no.
p3815
aVI downloaded the leak last night, so once again I have listened to both albums.
p3816
aVPsychosphere is the jimmy jam jawn smash. 
p3817
aVThese guys hit a home run that rebounded back and they hit it again.\u000a\u000aSeriously this is awesome
p3818
aVAm I the only one who thinks heavy heart is really really boring?
p3819
aVI thought heavy heart was one of the best tracks on the album.\u000a
p3820
aVIt's different. Not that there's anything wrong with it, that is. It's fantastic, but it's just one that's growing on me a bit slow. After listening to both albums though, Omega takes the cake as the better half. Much heavier and meaty, especially the last 3 songs. Congrats though guys!
p3821
aVWell, let's just say that I'm very happy about putting in a pre-order for this album.
p3822
aVI really really enjoyed Alpha, but Omega absolutely blew me away. It's so heavy and dark and i'm glad it lived up to the hype in my opinion.
p3823
aVI thought this was fucking fantastic.
p3824
aVI'm really digging the Coheed influence in the sound.
p3825
aVThis album really goes well with Diablo 3. Just throwing that out there.
p3826
aVWas getting into you guys with PII. But, I just spun both these. Holy hell. These albums are groovy as fuck. 
p3827
aVExcitement is an understatement.\u000a\u000a
p3828
aVI would delete this so you dont get banned
p3829
aVYeah, I just read the sidebar. Oopsies.
p3830
aVMy opinion definitely echoes that of those who are put off by Sotelos vocals. I've been listening to periphery since before P1 so I'm not just hating, I'm legitimately disappointed. From a professional musical career standpoint for the band, adding vocals made sense. You can appeal to a wider audience and be a "complete" group to be accessible to more mainstream labels/tours. But with that addition they sacrificed what got them here; rhythmically deep and creative songwriting that take time to ebb and develop throughout a single track (most notably on tracks like Racecar). They have glimmers of this in P2 and Jugg, but nothing like in P1 and before. The vocals detract from anything interesting that's happening instrumentally and breaks the immersion of the listener. 
p3831
aVLoving it so far, Nolly you are my hero I can't wait to see you guys again. 
p3832
aVAre they gonna release Omega too? 
p3833
aVyeah they are
p3834

aV[deleted]
p3836
aVIs it just me or does the bass really overpower everything else in the mix?
p3837
aVWhere did it go?
p3838
aVAh, The instrumentation is cool as is the atmosphere and melody but does anyone else here think the singers voice is winey and annoying?\u000a\u000aIt just reminds me of too many emo/screamo/core/whatever bands singers from the 2000's and ruins it for me.\u000a\u000aI wonder how his growl is. I feel like a lot of singers over do it and "over sing" because they feel like they are the spotlight/center of attention.\u000a\u000aSorry Misha. You're a cool dude and I've been listening to your music since you had a "bulb" MySpace.
p3839
aVI have always disliked the Vocals in this band, the cleans at least. To me, they are very whiney and just obnoxious. Really takes me out of the music anytime they come in. Really like the instruments, but I can't stand the dude when he sings.
p3840
aVYeah this. Instrumentals would be awesome.
p3841
aVWith ya there, it bothers me at times because there's really interesting instrumentation happening but his vocals are distracting
p3842
aVLove that album by the way^
p3843
aVI'l listen to the whole thing later, but I'm finding it kind of hard to get past the vocals which, to me, seem very cheesy and remind me much of bands like fall out boy or something. I like the complexity and varied nature of it, especially the jazz fusion-ey mix after the first part but the heart and soul of the band just seems a but...lacking.\u000a\u000aEdit: couldn't do it.
p3844
aVBring at least 15 changes of pants. You will jizz them.
p3845
aVFirst listen, Alpha not that much memorable, Omega jsut started but then again, PI was the same thing, then listened to "New Groove" and heard the band with new ears.\u000a\u000aSo far, Sylosis' is a much stronger album, let me finish this and wait to see if BTBAM will destroy my mind again.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Hell Below is something, huh?\u000a\u000aEDIT2: Meh. I had so much hype... back to Sylosis.\u000a\u000aEDIT3: All the songs are good. Best album of January

aVMan I miss the old [Cynic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_09IAg12q8)

aVNot me, I like Focus but to me it's not nearly as good as the masterpiece that is Traced in Air. I like the new one too, not as much, but I appreciate that it's not a repeat of TiA. It has more of neo-progressive rock vibe to it.
p3862
aVI just really liked the Chapman stick.
p3863
aVChapman stick is totally boss.
p3864
aVCynic seems to be heading in the direction that Aeon Spoke and Gordian Knot have been, and melding into a fusion of the both. You can even hear some of Sean Reinart's Cortlandt, and Cynic's Portal Tapes in Kindly Bent to Free Us. Overall it is an exceptionally solid release, but generally Cynic has been straying from their original sound in their debut album since the beginning. Which really shows how progressive and original they are with their music, but often times leaves old school fans in the dust. I still remember when TiA was released and it received a lot of flack from old school fans since it deviated so much from the debut album, bu the Portal Tapes were evidence that the original sound was already being moved away from.

p3886
(lp3887
VLike you said, I find it just okay.  But one listen isn't really enough.  It seems pretty similar to the void compositionally, but stylistically less heavy. It just doesn't stand out like Destined Solitaire, the Sane Day, and Sleeping in Traffic(s) managed to on first listen.  Instrumentally it's pretty awesome, but it just feels like it's missing some important, indescribable element that Beardfish is known for. I've felt this way about the previous two albums as well.
p3888
aVNail on the head, right there
p3889
aVI think Ode to the Rock'n'Roller  is one of the best songs that they've written. However, I'm a fan of Gungfly  which is more straightforward  than Beardfish is. It does lack the typical playfulness but within the context of their discography  it makes sense, but I'm a sucker for Beardfish.

At 4:36 when all the instruments calmly roll into that repeated melody, it never fails to give me chills. \u000a\u000a I also love how, inverse to typical pop music, the verse is very simple and catchy, whereas the chorus is fairly dissonant and eery.

aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_the_Skye\u000a\u000a&gt;According to an interview on the DVD The Making of Crack the Skye, this album represents the element of aether\u000a\u000a&gt;the element of air is the only classical element which has yet to be represented by a Mastodon album\u000a\u000ahttp://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=49897\u000a\u000a&gt;Daniel: All of your albums thus far, are connected by an elemental theme. Are you also planning on including the Chinese elements of metal and wood in the future in addition to air? (\u201cRemission\u201d is fire; \u201cLeviathon\u201d is water; \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d is Earth; \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d is the fifth element/aether/quintessence).\u000a\u000a&gt;Bill: Yes. We have been thinking about that, the Chinese elements. Because there are a lot of elements out there, not just four or five like some people think.\u000a\u000a&gt;Daniel: So do you think that after touring, the next plausible concept would be air element in order to complete the elemental suite?\u000a\u000a&gt;Bill: Well, I don\u2019t know. This album is more of an aether based record. But air, I don\u2019t know. It would be something like wind or air I believe, but I don\u2019t really know because we have not crossed that bridge yet.\u000a\u000aPlease... Stop. I'm begging you all.

aVI just discovered these guys. They're one of the best bands around right now. Top echelon composition. 
p3960
aVFuck, My personal favorite album by them. I remember, the first time I heard them, it was with this album. Somebody recommended them on here to somebody else, and I decided to go listen to it, and the path came on, and I was like it's okay, kind of reminds me of a more upbeat too\u0142 song, and then atlas song came on, and I actually heard the instrumentation, I think I cried by the end of the album that first time, it was so beautiful. It IS so beautiful. And it's been a year now, I've (legally) purchased every album by them, and I'm anticipating the release of their next album, because if they keep up to their previous pattern, it should be around August to November of next year. 
p3961
aVthis is by far my favorite song on the album.  Everyone i know either loves or hates this band because they "sound like dream theater", which honestly is pretty on point.  I can sympathize with those who don't connect with the style, even though I'm a huge fan of both this album and all things DT.  That said, this song seems to be undeniably appealing.  Its melodic, heavy, super clever, and theres that one part.  you know the one thats like\u000a\u000aat 3:02 \u000a\u000adududu dududu DNDNDN\u000a\u000adududu da dnnde da DU\u000a\u000adududu DNDNDN DA DE DA QOICHS\u000a\u000adududu dududu DNDNDN\u000a\u000adududu da dnnde da DU\u000a\u000adududu DNDNDN DA DE DA whoosh \u000a\u000aDNDNDA dududu dududu DN DAdndndn\u000a\u000ade DU DU DU de dndndn DU KN KN KN\u000a\u000aDNDNDA dududu dududu DN DAdndndn\u000a\u000ade DU DU DU de dndndn DU \u000a\u000aDE DA DN DUUU\u000a\u000aand then the whole ending is amazing also.
p3962
aVDream Theater? Fuck no, these guys actually have voices that don't sound obnoxious. The instrumentation and writing in terms of harmonic and rhythmic concepts is way more interesting. And you actually hear homages to other prog progenitors like King Crimson instead of just being entirely self referential. I don't think these guys sound like dream theater at all. 
p3963
aVim sure they have other influences, but they dont sound like DT at all?  cmon... I could literally point out riffs that they "stole" or were massively influenced by.\u000a\u000aThis entire album's structure even seems loosely based around the structure Scenes from a memory.  quiet opening sets the themes before the first real song.  Song starts, does some proggy shit, but then goes into a bluesy riff to break it up and be like "aight we're ready to go" .\u000a\u000ahome/paradoilia are at basically the same place in the album, and are both the "phrygian dominant" sounding song on the album.  finally free/somebody both start quiet after the song that might have been the ultimate climax of the album.\u000a\u000ai can keep going and be more specific, but you're in straight denial if you think these dudes arent MASSIVELY influenced by DT.\u000a\u000alisten to that song off their new EP, i think its called "the dark eternal night" or something, if you need more evidence.
p3964
aVVocals in this one are so powerful. I love how this, by comparison, is among their shorter songs, but it still has so much intensity packed into it.
p3965
aVThis is such an amazing band, and I fucking loved that album. It satisfied a musical craving I didn't even know I had.
p3966
aVDoes anyone else know of bands similar to Haken and Dream Theater I really like both of these bands and want to find more music like them. I just have a hard time sifting through music trying to find stuff I like.
p3967
aVYou would enjoy Circus Maximus and their album Nine.
p3968
aVLove CM, but I would suggest starting with their first album The First Chapter, as it is more in keeping with the music of Haken/DT. Then listen to the rest in order, as they are all fantastic.

aVI'm at the same time a big AAL fan and becoming increasingly weary of djent. They're really the only band that gets me excited in the genre (along with Tesseract, who is a half step below). When I saw them live last year and they played this song (before the album was released) I remember thinking that in 10-15 years this section will stick out like a sore thumb and people will mock 2014. But overall a great record. I bet Tosin eventually completely moves away from djent.
p4010
aVI was attracted to their music because they seem to write a musical "song" that is appealing instead of just showing off skills. I find it more accessible than other djent or prog. He was great live when I saw them too
p4011
aV&gt;  I remember thinking that in 10-15 years this section will stick out like a sore thumb and people will mock 2014. \u000a\u000aThey're not the first, nor last to throw a `000000` riff in a song.  It's only 8 seconds of the song, too.  Nothing compared to corridor of chameleons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C8oK88_3AU\u000a\u000aOr emmure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF8psEdwVVo\u000a\u000aMaybe we'll look back on these kinds of riffs and laugh/cry.  But AAL is far from the worst offender.
p4012
aVI think you missed the entire point of my post, to be honest. I flat out said they're my favorite of the genre and this is basically the last remnants of djent in what they do.\u000a\u000aThey're not the worst offender, they're my favorite of the genre, and that part sticks out compared to the rest of their album. I'm not sure how to make that clearer, to be frank.

aVAm i alone in being completely underwhelmed by the songs they've put out since getting back together?  I've always been a huge FNM fan, and have also enjoyed a majority of Mike Patton's various projects over the years, but i guess my expectations were too high given the length of their hiatus.  But at the same time i've really loved Failure's new tunes after an equally lengthy hiatus, so maybe FNM is just moving in a new direction which doesn't appeal to me as much...

aVAfter falling madly in love with both discs of Precambrian, I avoided their newer stuff for the longest time because I didn't think it could measure up, especially knowing the major lineup changes.  Boy was that foolish.  Last 3 albums are amaaaazing and I like that they're sticking with this vocalist, he brings a lot to the table.  I see a lot of people trashing Anthropo/Helio for some reason but to me they're pretty even with Pelagial which seems to get a lot more love.  
p4047
aVI love both albums but for me the biggest problem is the amount of pure filler on both, especially with heliocentric. I found myself having to make separate playlists that removed a good chunk of the songs just to get through repeat listens.

Lots of riffs, amazing solos, fantastic groove throughout.

If you use your usual methods to write every album you\u2019ll find yourself stuck in a quagmire of old habits.\u201d\u000a\u000a&gt; He adds of the lyrics: \u201cThe Congregation covers the dangers and consequences of blindly following the flow \u2013 thus the title will speak for itself.\u201d

p4132
(lp4133
VHey! I am currently listening to what I think is the final master of the new EP, so won't be too long now :-) Sorting out options for physical stuff (wanting to do a special edition box-set for the EP trilogy and a shirt or two) at the moment as well, and as soon as that's all figured out I'll make a proper announcement, start getting stuff made and taking pre-orders!\u000a\u000aAs mentioned, Simon from The Helix Nebula is on bass, my dad also played some double bass on one of the tracks which was cool. Chris Letchford did a sick guest solo on the first track, and I had a young and insanely talented Polish buddy of mine do a solo on the last track (I'm sure most of you know who I'm talking about). Most exciting in the lineup for me is the drummer, in my opinion the best prog drummer around right now :-)\u000a\u000aAnd yep - trying to sort out some local shows with the Helix Nebula at the moment, UK Techfest is happening in July and some other stuff beyond that is on the cards too. Really excited and I love you all for taking an interest and the encouragement!
p4134
aVThanks for the response! If "some other stuff beyond that" means venturing to the US at some point, know that you'll have at the very least one in attendance in NY.

aVPaging /u/plini_. Any updates we can have? 
p4139
aVI follow him on Facebook, all I've gathered is that he is recording another EP, and got the guy from Helix Nebula to play bass. I also think he's getting a band together to start playing shows/festivals.

aVYou should anyway.

aVI can listen to this song all day every day.  This album's butting heads with Synchestra as my favorite Devin album.
p4147
aVI've often considered it my favorite Devin song.  I know it's not his best (that would be *Suicide*), but *Funeral* never fails to put a smile on my face from the very first note.
p4148
aVThis entire album is gorgeous.
p4149
aVI've only heard Ziltoid the Omniscient album. And it is great.

aVgeez man, listen to all of this album (Ocean Machine) it's his first solo album after leaving Steve Vai and he sure started off strong.\u000a
p4151
aVZiltoid is great, but probably one of my least favorite of Dev's solo albums. Which should tell you how damn good all of the rest are! I highly recommend going through his whole discog.

p4180
(lp4181
VYou're in luck! I took a few lessons from Matt years ago and I also asked about ghost notes. Here's the exercise he gave me, it's basically a variation of a Thomas Lang exercise but with ghost notes incorporated.\u000aSo R=snare K=kick r= ghost note snare\u000a\u000aR K r K R K r..... count up to 8 or whatever then switch to your left hand. once you good at it you want to start doing variations like\u000a\u000aR K r K L K l K R K r K L K l K....expert mode incorporate ghost kicks as well.
p4182
aVSo I alternate a normal snare note and a ghost note between each kick?
p4183
aVPretty much yeah, there's lots of ways you can variate it. Be sure to use a metronome.
p4184
aVOkay! And the L in the second pattern...what do those represent?  Thanks a lot by the way!  I'm so jealous you got lessons with the one and only :(
p4185
aVThe L stands for left hand. Yeah I got him on Skype before the whole band happy thing, he's a cool guy.
p4186
aVIt looks like he's using his fingers to bounce the stick more and using ghost notes mostly in between the bass drum hits which might help with the endurance. 
p4187
aVMatchstick grip at 4:00 combined with the Moeller technique. It's an exaggerated whipping technique that allows gravity to do most of the work. E.g. : When playing the accented note(s) he is creating momentum and allowing the rebound to drag and rebound multiple times with his other fingers.
p4188
aVJust hit the snare lightly? He is using a lot of fingers instead of wrist. There's no real secret to it

VI used to run one of these [about a year ago or two ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/search?q=aotw&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) but the interest just wasn't there. It didn't create the discussion I was hoping for and not many people sent in suggestions for albums.\u000a\u000aI'd be open to the idea of doing it again but only if it generated enough discussion/was backed more by the sub with album suggestions and whatnot.
p4199
aVThat'd be great if you want to do that again, and we can help promote it a little better.  I don't think we had the flair and everything set up at the time and that could certainly help out.  Can't guarantee it'll be more successful, but it might be worth a go.
p4200
aVIf you can sticky them for the week, I'll give it another shot.
p4201
aVWe can only have one sticky at a time I think, so an AMA or something on a given week might supersede it, but at the very least we can give it an "official" tag and a link in the top bar.  Otherwise, yeah we can sticky it.
p4202
aVSounds good. I'll pick up where I left off on Sunday.

p4222
(lp4223
sVThe Heisenprog Uncertainty Principle?
p4224
(lp4225
VI think the reason that we see so many arguments about what prog is/isn't it that it's never been properly defined. When the genre started back in the 70's it wasn't called prog, it was just a bunch of bands writing music that might have shared some similar traits and were retroactively labelled "prog". \u000a\u000aThen for 20 - 30 years prog essentially had no widespread media presence that could disseminate a solid definition of the genre, so isolated communities formed, each with their own ideas about what ideas were progressive or not. The internet did wonders for connecting people with bands in the style, but there are still some pretty isolated communities with their strict definitions on the genre. The Progarchives community has a vastly different standards for prog than RateYourMusic, which has different ideas than here, etc. \u000a\u000aThen there's just the confusing label the genre has anyway. Is it music that's consistently progressing from the most recent trend? Or is it based on the characteristics that the OG bands like King Crimson, Yes, Jethro Tull, etc had? Why take the "progressive" part literally but not the "rock" part? Would a field recording of boulders being smashed together in 11/8 for 30 minutes be the epitome of prog rock?\u000a\u000aThe arguments about metal just confuse me, particularly the "metalcore is not metal" debates. I'm not denying a punk influence there, but when I listen to Between the Buried and Me I think more of Dream Theater or other metal groups than The Clash. Plus there's the whole "purity of the genre" thing people blather on about, as if thrash wasn't the first time punk and metal crossed over.\u000a\u000aThat's my really wordy, anecdotal two cents.
p4226
aVThat's really cool lol. A periodic table for metal bands . I like the idea! Each group would mean a different genre of metal . But damn, this would require a lot of fucking planning and time . But I think we can do it.

aVWhat are you doing here then? Get sexing. 
p4253
aVI am very much familiar with Porcupine Tree and its history, as well as most of their side projects. Just give me the stylistic guidelines and I'll do it. However, I'm not exactly a good writer.\u000a\u000aI am currently writing a small-ish piece on the history of prog metal so I might as well do that, too.
p4254
aVWould you happen to have any existing examples that demonstrate your writing capabilities? Stylistically, it's just basic historical/factual bio, detailing the band's evolution as well as their impact and importance to prog metal. 
p4255
aVI don't have time to do the research but if Abarisol wants to cooperate I can write it up (I'm a writing consultant at my college).
p4256
aVThat's no problem, feel free to send him a message. You can be credited too. 
p4257
aVUh, in regards to music? No, not really. Pretty much the only thing I can show off is some [Dark Souls 2 guide on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=309721531) I wrote a couple of months ago. It's one of the most popular and highest-rated there is despite being incredibly specific, if I may say so.\u000a\u000aAlthough I imagine to somebody who never played the game it probably sounds like gibberish and not much else.
p4258
aVI see no glaring problems with your writing, based on that piece. The mods can edit your final draft anyway, if need be. \u000a\u000aWe do already have two other people who have shown interest in writing the bio. Because very few bios end up panning out regardless of people volunteering to write them, we will just feature the first person to finish theirs first (if anyone). So if you're a fast writer you'll get dibs.

aVI just noticed your username, props. I really have to get stoned to btbam, I've listened to catch 33 in its entirety and that was almost like a spiritual experience, but btbam will feel more like she's journey I think. \u000a\u000aParallax, the great misdirect and colors are on my list. \u000aHave you listened to language by the contortionist? 
p4279
aVLove your name, as well! Protest are top 5 for me. \u000a\u000aMan, you HAVE to get stoned to BTBAM. It's so time consuming (which is perfect for days off or boredom), but wonderfully so. Journey is a great word for it. \u000aAs for The Contortionist, Language is definitely a great stoner album. Honestly, any of their albums are great stoned. (I smoke/listen to albums a lot.) Not sure why it (Language) is getting mixed reviews. I absolutely love it.
p4280
aVWill definitely do it, thanks dude. I love them enough to have a tattoo of Colors and a small night owl. Looking to turn that into one big BTBAM/space themed sleeve. \u000a\u000aYou know, I've always disregarded The Contortionist as a 'core' band with too much going on out of sheer ignorance. I even decided to skip seeing them when they supported Protest in Dec 2014. But I listened to Language last week after seeing it on this sub a lot, and I'm honestly blown away by it. I hear Cynic, BTBAM, Tesseract, Tetrafusion in this album, but it's very mature and holds it's own. \u000a\u000aEDIT: Also meant to correct myself about Extremophile Elite, it's more of an Indian riff? very similar sitar sounds
p4281
aV*Oriental* is a better word for that riff.
p4282
aVEhhh, I dunno. I think I do hear sitar-like sounds in there. 
p4283
aVNice, man! I have Colors on my ribs. Always thought the owl was cool, just not for me.\u000a\u000aI think some more time with their previous two albums, and you'll come to love TC as a whole, haha.

aVThat needs "more love"? Everyone recognized it as the standout riff of Extremophile because it brings back the part from Spectral Reflection.
p4286
aVThis is news to me, which part exactly in Spectral Reflection?
p4287
aVAt that part he says "walking into a certain state of" in that 5/4 pattern. Same as 8:56 in spectral reflection
p4288
aVThe pattern and vocals are the same but the riff is not. 
p4289

p4292
aVall good, the transitions are kinda similar i confuse them too sometimes

aVI really wish Blake's was from the studio. He plays it differently live and it's like watching a bad lip syncing.
p4298
aVBest song on Parallax 2 IMO. This is really the big climax of the story IMO. 
p4299
aVSomewhat, for me it's obviously Silent Flight Parliament. But I find Telos the most 'antagonistic' and ominous/malevolent song on the album which really gives you an idea as to what the Night Owls are. 
p4300
aVWhen this album first came out, I remember reading an interview in which Paul said that Telos is the meat and potatoes of the album.
p4301
aVInteresting, in what way do you think he meant? In terms of story?\u000a\u000aI think of Bloom and Astral Body being the more 'fun' songs with a bit less lyrical relevance to the storyline, fillers such as Black Box/Goodbye to everything to help build up to 'meaty' songs such as Extremophile Elite, Lay your Ghosts to Rest, Melting City, Telos. And finally Silent Flight Parliament as the one big epic on the album to close everything off. Its nice that it finishes with Reprise as the album comes full circle. 
p4302
aVApparently Bloom finishes the story from Swim to the Moon when the protagonist goes out to sea to die and gets pulled under.  They realize his special purpose and let him go.\u000a\u000aEdit: Not Sun of Nothing, Swim to the Moon
p4303
aVNot sure if you were talking about me, but Telos is the part of the story where Prospect 2(I think it's 2, could be wrong) decides to destroy the human race and ignore Prospect 1. Telos literally means "the end". And it has parts from the point of view of Prospect 2's wife who he left behind without any explanation, and she leaves him a note in case he comes back and then kills herself. \u000a\u000aI feel like the entire story as a whole, starts to conclude from this song and everything after. Of course there are out of context parts like Bloom, but still. 
p4304
aVMy Greek is a little rusty but doesn't it mean end? But yeah I think you're right!
p4305
aVYeah you are right. The song is about the decision to destroy the human race, and Telos means the end.(of the human race)
p4306
aVmy google fu says that it's simply as you said, Telos means 'end'
p4307
aVLay Your Ghosts To Rest for me. The part where its made to sound like its through a crappy speaker gets me every time.
p4308
aVlove that part

aVTheir energy was otherworldly. Sun Eater is an awesome album, you should definitely give it a spin... it's a pretty radical departure from their old sound. But in the best way possible. 
p4313
aVThat's what I hear and why Im interested. I was never a fan of their prior deathcore/techdeath sound but reviews kind of said that they really grew into a more full-bodied sound, almost progressive in a sense. Which sounds really cool. Don't know what to expect but its on my spotify!

p4317
aVThis is my favorite track off Parallax II. Honestly though, this is probably my least favorite record from BTBAM. Alaska through TGM are gold though. 
p4318
aVWeird, I find Colors, TGM and this album to all be about equal and everything else to be a step below. Alaska just suffers from subpar production and a lot of riff&gt;riff&gt;riff&gt;riff etc...

(lp4332
VNever heard shredding on a jazz album before this one
p4333
aVYou should check out some more fusion, it's great stuff.
p4334
aVi'm thoroughly impressed. i don't usually care for the predecessor bands but these guys are great
p4335
aV"The Inner Mounting Flame" was the first "old" album I ever heard that made me think *there is nothing modern better than this*.
p4336
aVThis album is awesome and the intensity is cranked way up to a 10.  I keep hearing that John McLaughlin reinvented rock / jazz / fusion / prog blah blah genre guitar playing from people who were around when this album dropped.  Wish I was there to hear just how radical this was by comparison.
p4337
aVIt was in '73, so it was similar in time to Crimson around the Lark's Tounges in Aspic era, so they were contemporaries in the sound.
p4338
aVAlso check out Mclaughlin's solo stuff. You can hear the HUGE influence he had on someone like Paul Masvidal, in this for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLzrvWV8OZo.
p4339
aVThanks for this...it's doing something special for me.  Never heard this before but somehow it feels as if it's been with me my entire life.  Such warm melodies, great interplay between guitar and flute--simply beautiful music.  I could listen to similar material forever and allow it to be the soundtrack of my life.
p4340
aVFeels good to hear that, brings me back to when I first heard it.\u000a\u000a It is indeed beautiful. I love this particular piece because the melodies are very memorable and magical, yet it is quite complex harmonically as well, it is such a rare balance. The entire album is brillant. 
p4341
aVMahavishnu Orchestra is awesome!\u000a\u000aI got into Jazz fusion/prog freshman year of high school and tunes by these guys, Return to Forever, Soft Machine, Yes, King Crimson, Rush, ELP, etc really opened my ears to music and I've never looked back. \u000a\u000a[Then I listened to Meshuggah's Catch 33 summer of freshman year...](http://i.imgur.com/44PLDuX.jpg)\u000a

VI'm so glad Dan calmed down and didn't drench Witherscape in a bunch of synths. There are a few points on Moontower (and a ton on Crimson II) where it's hard to tell there are actually guitars that the synths are supposed to be complimenting.\u000a\u000aStill love those albums, though, especially the spacey intro to this song.

VI think this song is still my favorite so far off the front half of Inmazes. After a fairly standard opening riff, there's just a bunch of cool melodies and surprising sections that follow. 2 minutes or so is such a nice vocal melody with really cool texture behind it.\u000a\u000aFree download from [bandcamp here](https://volaband.bandcamp.com/).

aVGreat band! 
p4352
aVGreat band. It's as if Dredg, Mew, and Meshuggah had babies together.
p4353
aVOmg, was introduced to this by It Djents, but after a few days of listening to it on my own, I fucking LOVE this album. So awesome, and this is definitely one of the best songs. 
p4354
aVoh my...\u000a\u000aEdit:  Went and downloaded the album, listened to it all (plus some) and wow.  Best new band I've heard in a long time.  One of my favorites from the album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Akzp5Oqww\u000a\u000aThe singer kinda reminds me of the dredg guy in that song above.  And the synths are awesome.

p4373
aVOne of the best Opeth songs.
p4374
aVYep, it's in my top 20 Opeth songs
p4375
aVHaha I love that that's a legitimate thing. 
p4376
aVThere are so many amazing songs that it's hard even to make a top 20 though. 
p4377
aVDefinitely one of my all time favorites. I still listen to it at least once every few days, usually every day though. 
p4378
aVI got into Opeth back when downloading music one song at a time (with a dial-up modem) was a thing. The tracks I grabbed from MAYH were "April Ethereal" and "Demon of the Fall". I remember once I finally heard the full CD and "When" kicked in, I was just like *Oh my gosh, the whole album is this good.*
p4379
aVOpeth was my first metal band too.\u000a\u000aWhen I was younger, think 14 or 15, like most kids I listened to the rock/pop playing on the radio. In the after-school center, we had this room with a pool table and a stereo where the older kids could bring their CDs and play them. At the time, one of the more popular poprock bands had released a CD that had some hard rock songs on it, most didn't like it, but I did. And I played it everytime I could. One of the youth workers there came up to me one time and suggested I listened to some metal and handed me a copy of *Ghost Reveries*. I came home and listened to it and never looked back.
p4380
aVI got to metal via radio rock, buying Filter's "Title of Record" ("Welcome to the Fold" is *really* heavy for a 1999 MTV viewer), then getting Deftones "White Pony" (ditto "Elite", easily the heaviest song I'd heard at that age), then my first proper metal album was Living Sacrifice's "The Hammering Process" which I listened to nonstop until I got into more Solid State Records stuff. Extol became my favorite band of that group (for good reason), and that led me to other progressive death metal like Opeth. 
p4381
aVI discovered those two first as well, and I just listened to them without hearing the rest of the album.  Luckily, one time I didn't change the song after April Ethereal ended, and I was introduced to this beautiful masterpiece. 
p4382
aVFollowed by Ghost of Prediction. 
p4383
aVThat's the prequel. 
p4384
aVdamnit.
p4385
aVThat riff at 4:25 is impossible not to headbang to.
p4386
aVMAYH definitely my top Opeth album
p4387
aVAh, my first Opeth album, favourite to this date.
p4388
aVI agree. While their later albums like Watershed and Deliverance are still great, I doubt any band, including Opeth, will ever create something as amazing as My Arms Your Hearse again. I still think Blackwater Park and Still Life are pretty close behind this album though. 
p4389
aVI think My Arms Your Hearse is one of the better sounding albums I've heard, mastering-wise. The way the guitar tracks blend together, drums, incredible vocals. The compositions are great, but coupled with the amazing sound... you might just be right. Something better might never happen. I might be biased though, sentiment and stuff.\u000a\u000aThe other albums are close, true, Still Life being almost there (Godhead's Lament!). Anyway, I'm pretty sure Opeth can't succeed in making a bad album :) I absolutely like the way their music evolves, which might be the reason that although my music tastes changed over the years, Opeth was always around.\u000a\u000aOne of the best bands in history for sure.\u000a
p4390
aVI think the only thing that I don't love about this album is its mastering. Sorry, but I think Steven Wilson's sound is much better suited for Opeth. It's much more dynamic.
p4391
aVWhat works for me in MAYH is they took the harmonies they always had to the next level and made them sound exceptional using "only" mastering. I mean, I can easily distinguish individual guitar tracks in their later albums (which is good!) but there's something unique about MAYH guitars that makes them sound *great* together, even though they "blend" so much. Still dynamic, still have power, they're just different compared to newer albums, or any band at their time.\u000a\u000aWhether it was deliberate or not is another story -- I don't know, and don't really care. I just love the way the album sounds. Again, I might be biased due to my sentiment.\u000a\u000aEither way, MAYH is an album that really shows that Opeth didn't settle for dull metal of the 90's. They're always ahead :)\u000a
p4392
aVI had a really good system in my car, before it was stolen. 2x10 alpine subs in an infinity band pass box and 800 watt dual channel Rockford fosgate amp powering it. I cranked up my car only to hear the intro to this song. Bowu Ba nu nah... Then the screaming and double bass kicked in, and I almost shit my pants. I had apparently let the riff play once and turned my car off leaving me only one play through of the acoustic part. I'll never forget that absolute fear from music. Still makes me smile to this day.

p4415
aVThey sure have come a long way !
p4416
aVMatt Rose is a far, far worse vocalist than both Neema and Greg. Gnosis would have been better off with these two recording. Neema's yappy style may not be your thing, but he fucking brings it in a way that not many vocalists do (both live and on recordings). Admit Defeat, Doxa, 97% Static, The Uncollective and Memoirs with these guys are all far better than the 'official' versions we got. \u000a\u000aI liked Neema in Fellsilent and Monuments. He may not be your thing but he's a talented and unique vocalist. ~~I'd link his solo stuff but I'm at work on mobile right now.~~ \u000a\u000aEdit - [He's got a great sense of rhythm](https://soundcloud.com/neema-askari/helix) and makes a wide variety of music
p4417
aVDude is it just me or do the vocals on Gnosis sound like they were run through a distortion plugin?
p4418
aVMatt Rose was terrible and never should have been in the band to begin with
p4419
aVI feel like I'm the only guy on this sub that actually likes and appreciates Neema's style of vox considering nobody does anything but trash him when these videos are posted. Makes me sad :(
p4420
aVI'm right here with you man! I don't know of very many other bands that actually have a groove to their vocal lines too, and it impresses me every time I hear it. 
p4421
aVDefinitely! When he gets going, the fast 'rap'-ish screams sound awesome over rhythmic music such as Monuments and Fellsilent. Gnosis left a bad taste in my mouth since we waited over 2 years for that album and they went from this to fucking Matt Rose... 
p4422
aVIs there any chance you know of anywhere that I can get a copy of the recorded versions of pre-gnosis Monuments? I messaged John Browne on Facebook about it, but he just said "Nah man."
p4423
aVI have the EP they released which is just Admit Defeat, The Uncollective and Memoirs. Otherwise, no, I'm not aware of there being anything out there other than live performances such as this one :/
p4424
aVYou mean before Matt Rose? I thought he was the vocalist prior to Chris.
p4425
aV[deleted]
p4426
aVthese singers were in the band
p4427
aVThose are guest vocalists not the actual vocalist before Chris Baretto, listen to their first album "Gnosis" the original vocals on Empty Vessels Make the Most Noise are nothing like this\u000a\u000aEdit: For the lazy - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NGV1GVPmTwo
p4428
aVI'm sorry but that's not true. The vocals were re written for the release of gnosis, and this is the original style of the song. These 2 vocalists were official members, and recorded this style of vocals on Monuments first demo. (Source http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monuments_%28metal_band%29)

aVEasily my favorite track on the album. The aggression around the "Breathe in the pain..." part is so awesome.
p4461
aVI'm so partial to the "*Cockroach King*" that I can't fully agree with you, but it's definitely a close second. That said, "*The Mountain*" is such an amazing album, that is really quite hard to choose.
p4462
aVCockroach King is awesome\u000a
p4463
aVI would rate it fourth after Cockroach King, Falling Back To Earth and Atlas Stone... that doesn't really make Pareidolia any lesser, of course! Haken is just so incredibly consistently good.
p4464
aVHaken is slowly replacing Dream Theater as my favorite band. I remember first discovering Aquarius and loving it, then when Visions came out I was even more excited. The Mountain just completely blew me away, and Crystallized off of their new EP pretty much sealed the deal for me.
p4465
aVThe first time that i listened Haken (just before they released The Mountain) I thought that that was what Dream Theater was supposed to sound now.\u000a\u000a
p4466
aVI've said it before: Haken sound what Dream Theater *should have been*. It's good that they're here to deliver me my fix of new over-the-top prog metal \u2014 without being (too) campy.
p4467
aVlol I love when people stake claims on what bands "should have" sounded like. It's like you're actually in the band or something!!
p4468
aVHaken has the sound Mike Portnoy wanted DT to become. 
p4469
aVExcept they all had to have a more jazzy approach, which then hardly ever did (perhaps a bit in the post-Berklee times). Ruddess could add the classical vibe to it, but I don't think that Petrucci would ever move in the jazz phrasing path. Dream Theater are more metal, Haken are more cross-over between metal, old school prog and jazz/classical. I think this is why they are widely considered as the next evolutionary step of prog (a.k.a. *the next Dream Theater*).
p4470
aVEvery song by Haken is an emotional journey. This song is no different. 
p4471
aVThis whole album is amazing. I saw them live in Leamington Spa last year. I was a bit worried before, as I thought that if the singer had a bad night the band would sound dreadful.\u000a\u000aThey were fricking awesome! After they settled into their groove a few songs in they were just too good. 
p4472
aVThe guitar part at [5:25](http://youtu.be/3HciKwoVAvo?t=5m25s) gives me the chills

asVLEE MCKINNEY (Born Of Osiris) - Skylasher
p4481
(lp4482
Vway to overproduced, album cover looks like it's a dubstep mixtape, the song writing kills though
p4483
aVI think this fucking rules. Almost every comment on Sumerian's page and YouTube are just guitar heads complaining about it being quantized or sped up- Yeah, no shit, it's done for effect. The weird guitar attack sounds rad, the super squashed bass sounds dope, I just think it's a really fun song.  \u000a  \u000aThat said, it's not really prog, but whatever.
p4484
asVI feel like I've heard this riff before...Any clues?
p4485
(lp4486
VSounds pretty much like the main riff of Animals as Leaders - New Eden:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5IqvZnR1fE&amp;t=0m8s\u000a\u000aThey even have the same sequence on the bell-like sound in the background.
p4487
aVThere it is! Thanks. Just realised that this sounds a little too similar to AAL's song, it's almost plagiarism.
p4488
aVUh oh

asVThe Hirsch Effekt - Ligaphob [7:01]
p4490
(lp4491
VI love these guys.
p4492
aVDamn, that was emotional. What was the meaning behind the video? \u000a\u000aI interpreted it as being about the power struggle in love and how problems like that can lead you right back to where you were before.\u000a
p4493
aVReally cool song. Don't have a clue what the lyrics translate too, but really cool.

asVThe Taste of Chaos Ensemble Performs Mastodon's Leviathan - Blood and Thunder. This is awesome!

(lp4496
Vholy shit. their seabeast cover.
p4497
aVI don't like it. I hate when these kind of covers, like *string quartet covers* or whatever just copy the sound of the lead lyrics with an instrument. It just sounds like those old MIDI songs we put on our cellphones as ringtones. Weird.\u000a\u000aEDIT: wow, I guess I'm sorry for having an opinion!
p4498
aVHow would you prefer the music to be arranged instead?

asVWide Eyes - Escape Velocity
p4500
(lp4501
VI dig it.
p4502
aVI will say that I like each successive Wide Eyes release more. Volume had a *ton* of tracks, but not too many were distinctly memorable and there were some mixing things (mainly ducking) that wore on me when listening to a lot of the album at once.\u000a\u000aSamsara I immediately enjoyed a lot, some great songs on there, actually a bunch of the middle tracks specifically stuck with me for a while.\u000a\u000aThe 2 songs from this upcoming album have both been fantastic, and a lot of fun, looking forward to hearing the rest.

aVYes.

VI haven't listened to these guys in so long. Still like 'em a lot though. Too bad they're more or less broken up though. ):
p4508
aVAwesome album, but the mix/production on it was sub-par IMO. Zach is a sick guitarist, and their old band [In Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiozLQhVumA) was pretty good too.
p4509
aVYeah, man. Zack is great, Elliot Coleman is, well, Elliot fuckin' Coleman. And then the Orbinator on drums. \u000a\u000aToo bad they couldn't stick with a vocalist. *coughElliotfuckingColemancough*.

aVGreat song but am I the only one that thinks the mix on the bass is a little weird? Like it's muffled?
p4519
aVIt sounds to me like they've hit their stride and worked out their own sound. Awesome vocal performance too.
p4520
asVJakob - Blind Them With Science (from Sines)
p4521
(lp4522
VDayum, I've known of this band but never really listened to them. This song though is amazing. 
p4523
aVThey've been inactive for quite a while due to injury, but they came out with the new album recently and it's great :)  I saw them open for ISIS on their final (I think) tour.  Not bad for a kiwi band.
p4524
aVI really love the simplicity of this song. 
p4525
aVSuch a huge layered sound for a 3 piece too.  Love it :)
p4526
asVSavatage - Prelude To Madness / Hall Of The Mountain King
p4527
(lp4528
VGreat band that are criminally no longer with us for no real discernible reasons...! I was always in the Zak Stevens camp. I love Jon Oliva but personally I don't think he's even close to a good vocalist - a great personality and driving forced behind the band, and an average keyboard player - but a great song writer.\u000a\u000aI fell in love with them when I saw them supporting Judas Priest in 2001, they had a new singer called Damon something...Jiniya or something like that...anyway that dude commanded the stage like no other...totally captivating. That was the Poets and Madmen tour for them I think...\u000a\u000aAnyway I got into Zak era Savatage and basically went nuts for them for years...loved that guy's voice and everything he did on Handful of Rain etc...but this truly is one band that have split their audience down the middle by line up and directional changes...I felt real hostility on their old message board when talking about Zak era stuff...!
p4529
aVI go for Jon Oliva as the lead singer of the group\u000a\u000aHe and his late brother made a fine team together but to each his own , I suppose.
p4530
aVYeah I can't argue Cris was an amazing guitar player...I can see why people are in the Jon camp and also why they see some of the Zak stuff as massively fucking pretentious...but I dunno, parts of Handful of Rain can bring me to tears, some of the lyrics affect me quite deeply, they really resonate...I dunno it is a case of each to his own as you say - personally the thing that sticks with me is how this band can be so take it or leave it to so many different kinds of people, even the hardcore fans...it's not like Ripper era Priest or Van Halen and Roth splitting, or whatever...it's so much more divisive than that! Either way though, no matter which era you prefer, they have released some absolutely stonking metal and prog metal tunes - and they have always put on a fantastic show which I was lucky enough to see twice - a real gem in the metal world and a worthy addition to anyone's collection of metal! I'd take Jon back as singer just to see them live again and releasing albums...the real tragedy is that they are no longer producing music under the name of Savatage.
p4531
aVIf only Criss Oliva was still with us....\u000a\u000aIf Criss had not died , he could have became a TSO member!\u000a\u000aRIP Criss (1963 - 1993)\u000a\u000a 
p4532
aVCriss Oliva\u000aRandy Rhodes\u000aDimebag Darrell....\u000a\u000aAll upstairs turning heaven into a moshpit...! 
p4533
aVI fucking love this song! 
p4534
aVThis album is pretty much perfect. Wow, Criss Oliva could play! A shame he passed away so young, I could definitely go for some more of his guitar wizardry.
p4535
aVI will never forget the first time I heard Hall of the Mountain King.\u000a\u000aI was a sophomore in high school, stoned out of my mind, watching metal mania with my good friend. This was a typical weekend for us and we knew most of the songs being played on this show...or so we thought...\u000a\u000aThis magical song came on and we both thought it was the greatest thing we've witnessed in a very long time. The music video and continuous metal screams the singer gives near the end blew us both away. I miss these kind of nights...\u000a\u000aI ended up buying the album and went through a pretty big Savatage stage for a while.  
p4536
aVMADNESS REIGNS\u000a\u000aIN THE HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING\u000a\u000aOH YEAH\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aMan, I wish I had remembered that for the lyrics thread the other day. Perfect delivery.
p4537
asVWhat are your favorite "epic" progressive rock/metal tracks.
p4538
(lp4539
VObligatory "White Walls".  But really though, there's a reason Colors/btbam in general is always mentioned on "best of" posts. And White Walls is Btbam at some of their very best.
p4540
aVSwim to the Moon - Between the Buried and Me
p4541
aV[Ne Obliviscaris - Painters of the Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTiX-xAgBi8) is one of my favourite ones from recent releases, clocking in at about 23 minutes.
p4542
aVObviously octavarium by dream theater
p4543
aVOne of my favorites by Hevy Devy, [The Mighty Masturbator.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eDngElZBxQ) Definitely prefer this live version to the studio version.
p4544
aVdo you have a prefered live version? could you give a link?
p4545
aVThe performance that I linked in my post was the only one that I could find that was the whole thing. I did find [this one, which features Greg from TDEP,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xB2_RHmbsQ) but it's only a small part of the song. Until a few minutes ago, I thought that Devin has only performed The Mighty Masturbator live only once (By a Thread in 2011.)
p4546
aVApparently I can't read and didn't see that you linked it. Sorry 
p4547
aVAnesthetize by Porcupine Tree

p4549
aVI really like [Deadman - Karnivool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbLEYQo98t0)
p4550
aVI like your thinking!
p4551
aVThe live version is amazing, too! 
p4552
aVDamn it, I don't care if it's 2 minutes under time, [Deliverance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0T-TPXS1M0) belongs here.
p4553
aV"The Last Baron" by Mastodon is a couple minutes under,  but it's still an epic. 
p4554
aV[Swim to the Moon](http://youtu.be/bhkpCjmXHTU) is probably my favorite, honorable mention to [Hemispheres](http://youtu.be/7uXCfDRddC0) and [Xanadu](http://youtu.be/5w3s2T0VBug) by Rush.\u000a\u000aedit: forgot to mention [In Death: Is Life/Death](http://youtu.be/Kx0klv82BDA) by Meshuggah 
p4555
aVSo many by Dream Theater and Symphony X.\u000a"Close to the Edge" - Yes\u000aHalf of the catalogue of Transatlantic.\u000a"When the Water Breaks" - Liquid Tension Experiment.\u000a"Orchestrion" - Pat Metheny (although more jazz than prog).\u000a
p4556
aVI remember being floored a few years ago the first time I heard Close to the Edge. It's amazing how ahead of their time Yes was.
p4557
aVOo When the Water Breaks, great one. I haven't listened to that song in awhile, might need to rectify that.
p4558
aVRagnarok- Periphery. Just such a big sound and Spencer's vocals soar above the heavy riffs just so epic. Before you say its not 15+ minutes the track was originally part of a much longer song that was then cut into 3 parts. 
p4559
aVAlso by Periphery, Racecar. That song has so many catchy riffs and sweet ass solos delivered over the course of 15 minutes.
p4560
aVIf you put Alpha and Omega (the songs) together, that makes for a pretty epic experience. I always listen to them back to back.
p4561
aVRagnarok is part of three tracks: Murumasa, Ragnarok, and Masamune. So you can just listen to those three back to back.
p4562
aVDream Theater - Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. I love the grand scale of it, the pace, the thematic material and figuring out what mental illness each part is about, the overture to establish the motifs and themes and then finding them throughout the composition, the different styles, and the two-minute final chord.\u000a\u000aMy favorite part is Solitary Shell. Sometimes a band can really shine when they tone it down and write simpler music, as is the case here.
p4563
aVDT: A Change Of Seasons.  This set the precedent. I always wished they would re-record this with Jordan,,,and now MM.,
p4564
aVI don't blindly hate on Mangini, but I don't see how re-recording it would do any good. It's a fantastic song and it's perfect for what they stood stilistically speaking. They sound much different now and I don't think they would give it justice (even though I think Rudess is a better keyboardist than Sherinian, in that song Sherinian really shined with his unique style)
p4565
aVAgree with all you said. I've heard it live and it sounds so much better without that snare. That.Snare. A piccolo? probably. It was a stylistic choice Portnoy made that was bold but I thought it detracted from his sound
p4566
aVSkies- Protest the Hero
p4567
aVProg Rock doesn't get much more epic than [Anathema - The Lost Song Part 1, 2 &amp; 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPutLvKjRTc) 
p4568
aVEdge of Sanity - Crimson and Crimson II\u000a\u000aBoth are 40+ minutes and if you haven't heard them yet you really should!
p4569
aV[Raider II - Steven Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I1db8yZdwk)\u000a\u000aAnesthetize by Porcupine Tree is fantastic as well.
p4570
aV/u/omegacluster wins the thread, I can barely find anything to add after that. Those and more are included in [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC52D77CB506F5F34) I made to catalog epic prog songs, though I made it a while ago so some vids have been deleted. \u000a\u000aHere's what I can find that hasn't already been mentioned:\u000a\u000a* Jethro Tull "Thick As A Brick" (43:54)\u000a* Jethro Tull "A Passion Play" (45:06)\u000a* Jethro Tull "Baker Street Muse" (16:37)\u000a* Roine Stolt "Humanizzimo" (20:54)\u000a* The Flower Kings "Garden of Dreams" (59:26)\u000a* The Flower Kings "Stardust We Are" (25:03)\u000a* The Flower Kings "I Am The Sun (Part One)" (15:03)\u000a* The Flower Kings "The Truth Will Set You Free" (31:01)\u000a* The Flower Kings "Devil's Playground" (25:26)\u000a* The Flower Kings "Love Supreme" (19:43)\u000a* The Flower Kings "Drivers Seat" (18:20)\u000a* The Flower Kings "Monsters &amp; Men" (21:19)\u000a* The Flower Kings "Love Is The Only Answer" (24:28)\u000a* The Flower Kings "Numbers" (25:26)\u000a* Marillion "Ocean Cloud" (17:59)\u000a* Marillion "This Strange Engine" (15:33, though listed over 30 minutes)\u000a* IQ "The Last Human Gateway" (19:57)\u000a* IQ "The Narrow Margin" (20:00)\u000a* IQ "Harvest of Souls" (24:29)\u000a* IQ "Without Walls" (19:15)\u000a* Big Big Train "For Winter" (16:47)\u000a* Big Big Train "The Underfall Yard" (22:45)\u000a* Big Big Train "East Coast Racer" (15:43)\u000a* The Tea Club "Firebears" (17:52)\u000a* Persefone "Sanctuary: Light and Grief" (23:43)\u000a* Persefone "Underworld: The Fallen and the Butterfly" (23:30)\u000a* Persefone "Seed: Core and Persephone" (22:47)\u000a* Van Der Graaf Generator "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" (23:21)\u000a* Van Der Graaf Generator "Meurglys III (The Songwriter's Guild)" (20:55)\u000a* The Alan Parsons Project "The Fall of the House of Usher" (16:11)\u000a* The Alan Parsons Project "The Turn of a Friendly Card" (16:28)\u000a* Green Carnation "Light of Day, Day of Darkness" (1:00:07)\u000a* Kalisia "Cybion" (1:11:11)\u000a\u000aand lastly, on a wildly different note,\u000a\u000a* Potmos Hetoimos "Dance With Divinity" (2:13:16)\u000a
p4571
aVShoot, I didn't realize he had already listed "Firebears", but I'm leaving it in my list too, because The Tea Club. 
p4572
aV&gt;Now, I'm sure I'm going to see "Octavarium," "The Odyssey," and "The Great Escape" \u000a\u000aYep, and I'm going to submit all three as three of the very best. Along with Anesthetize (Porcupine Tree), Six Degrees (Dream Theater) and Divine Wings of Tragedy (Symphony X) and you've got a top 6!\u000a\u000a
p4573
aVIt doesn't make the length criteria, but the most epic song to me in terms of sound is this: \u000a\u000a[Devin Townsend: Supercrush! (live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZLgXOz1om4)
p4574
aVAnything by [The Ocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ocean_%28band%29) I consider each of their [albums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZMTDcqKnQ) as singular pieces of work. To fully appreciate them you have to listen the whole way through. 
p4575
aVSurprised I had to scroll all the way down here to find The Ocean, definitely. 
p4576
aVAgreed, I didn't find them and had to share.
p4577
aVIt's not that long, but "Kingdom" by Devin Townsend Project. It's not that long, but I think it's pretty epic.
p4578
aVA short song but totally worth the title of EPIC. I prefer the more rough original cut, maybe a more 'clustered' sound but bigger and more raw in my opinion.
p4579
aVFew things will ever beat Light of Day, Day of Darkness. 
p4580
aVThere's a reason I have labelled it my favorite song of all, and every relisten validates my choice.
p4581
aVI know Blackwater Park is a bit under the time but damn it is epic as shit. also right now im in love with Silent Flight Parliament by Between the Buried and Me
p4582
aVI feel I should mention "The Garden" (22:33) and also "Journey's Friend" (16:30)  by Unitopia
p4583
aVAnts of the sky by between the buried and me, it's around 13 minutes though. 
p4584
aVWell im late to the party but i have to add my favourite song from any genre, not just prog. [Seventh Wonder - The Great Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMjO7y-98Ak)

aV"Ants of the Sky" by Between the Buried and Me comes to mind

aVWell, since you seem to have almost every other song/conglomeration of songs within the time limit I posted (and because I think you'd like it), you should check out that Frost* tune I have in the post description.

asVTesseracT - Eden
p4611
(lp4612
VAs good as Eden 2.0 is, I really like how this track develops over time.  This and Sunrise are my two favorite non-CF tracks off of One, I think.
p4613
aVI'm fairly partial to April myself. The lyrics are so sinister and the song just feels really well done.
p4614
aVI've just recently fallen in love with this song. The bass guitaring in it is incredible.
p4615
aVI love this song, particularly the one form the Perspective EP. I like Dan's voice better, but I like the way Elliot rearranged a few things here and there with the vocal melody. Especially the end of the song.  
p4616
aVYeah seriously, this version just builds up so much better and the payoff at the end is such an amazing close to the album. 6:32 is freaking interdimensional!
p4617
aVSunrise challenged me the first time I heard it.  I thought the opening riff was laughably simple, just the same note in that pattern.  But as the song progresses towards the end and builds back to that same riff with all those other elements on top of it it hits you like a ton of bricks.  Such amazing songwriting, I could see myself writing that opening riff easily enough but it takes a genius like Acle to turn it into what it becomes.
p4618
aVIt feels more like the original Eden is the 2.0 version and this one is the original
p4619
aVFavorite song off the album, love this one!\u000a\u000aI had to tune up my bass' strings to play this one and snapped one with all the pops from that beautiful main line. 100% worth it, 10/10 would rock out to this song again.
p4620
aVMy absolute favorite TesseracT song
p4621
asVGojira - The Gift of Guilt
p4622
(lp4623
VBorn in Winter is my favorite off this album. Completely different from anything else I've heard from them, and I guess the most "prog metal-ly" song on the album.  \u000a\u000a[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suG-c_i2fBQ) for those who haven't heard it. Wait for the metalz, it happens, don't worry. 
p4624
aVThe entire album is pretty rad, Born in Winter is no exception!
p4625
aVI completely agree with you. Born in Winter is by far my post played song from this album. His voice, the atmosphere, the mood changes, they all form a really beautiful song.
p4626
aVSame here. I prefer FMTS and TWOAF over L'Enfant Sauvage, but this song alone is one of my favorite Gojira songs overall.
p4627
aVFMTS is one of the best albums of the new millennium IMO.  
p4628
aVI hope they play it live soon.
p4629
aVdefinitely my favorite song off the last album. the guitar during the verses is awesome
p4630
aVThat got me hooked to the song as well. Not to take away from the tapping, but the verse riff is badass. 
p4631
aVThe verses are so heavy and the change around 1:45 is really fun to play on drums. I can only consistently/cleanly play the blasts in this song at 95% tempo though:( \u000a\u000a\u000aReally been digging Gojira lately, just need a few more listens on their earlier LPs\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT:\u000aWoops I was listening to All the Tears when I wrote this comment. lol...\u000aI was referring to The Gift of Guilt with the heavy verses though.
p4632
aVAw yeah, Gojira that I haven't heard
p4633
aVGo listen to the whole "L'Enfant Sauvage" album, it's really worth it.
p4634
aVI feel like an idiot now because I really like the first song on the album (Explosia) but I haven't gotten around to listening to the rest for some reason.
p4635
aVL'enfant Sauvage is incredibly good. I'd definitely recommend a listen(or more), if you haven't heard it before.
p4636
aVI did the same thing. I had this album for a year before I made it past the first song on this album and realized how good it was.

VI wish there was a progressive metal concept album about the Jurassic Park novel...

aVPink Lemonade by Closure in Moscow has a bunch of shit about dinosaurs in it.
p4647
aVMastodon have a lot of lyrics concerning dinosaurs and prehistoric life in general.  The song Ol'e Nessie, for example.
p4648
aVI'm not exactly sure what you're asking for, but if it's tapping in major keys that you like I'd check out Intervals. They do a lot of major key riffs/solos and it's a nice change of pace after listening to practically every metal song in harmonic minor.
p4649
aVI've listened to intervals, but I am looking more for tapping sections that pack a punch and have a drive.\u000a\u000a

p4654
aVThanks man!! I absolutely am addicted to synths in the mix being prominent and supportive. I get that a lot from DT of course. Sometimes, I just get underwhelmed with guitar, bass and drums solely; they need a little backup to create atmosphere.

asVIQ - The Road of Bones
p4657
(lp4658
VNot always been a fan of IQ, but I find this album epic and heavy. I love it.
p4659
aVOne of the best albums of 2014
p4660
aVHow it didn't get on more people's top 10 lists is a mystery to me. This, "Without Walls," "Constellations," "Until the End," and "Knucklehead" were some of the best songs I heard last year.
p4661
aVAgree. Amazed it didn't see more exposure in this sub.\u000a\u000aI'm also surprised no one got into Pervy Perkins as well. Criminal no one has mentioned that outstanding debut album.
p4662
aVAre you talking about this?\u000a\u000ahttp://pervyperkin.bandcamp.com/\u000a\u000aThat just doesn't work for me at all. 
p4663
aVYep. Each to their own mate :-) 
p4664
aVGo on, try me with another. 
p4665
aVHeavy Metal Ninjas. New Zealand's answer to Animals As Leaders. 
p4666
aVYeah I like this, I think I've heard them before. I'm also getting them confused with an Aus band that stop in the middle of their video and have this demented conversation, humorous. Similar name? Thanks!
p4667
aVThis is the only album I have heard of from IQ but I want to get into them more. The only issue is I buy CDs and it's so expensive to buy IQ albums and have shipped to the US. \u000a\u000aAt least the little bit I've looked on Amazon
p4668
aVI liked Subterrania a lot.  It's not as heavy, maybe just more of a prog album.  First IQ I ever got was their first album, Tales From The Lush Attic, which is purely prog, but if you like early Genesis, I think you'd love it.  
p4669
aVI'd recommend the album right before this one, Frequency.

VThis might just be the only Romanian metal band I know. But the country seems to have a pretty decent metal scene overall, which makes that odd.

aVTo be honest, I don't know anything about romanian music... except this band.

asVExivious - An Elusive Need (Favorite band)
p4684
(lp4685
VI maintain that this is the best Exivious song.  The outro is awesome.
p4686
aVOh man that outro cannot be denied its proper glory. In my opinion, its a tie for first place between this and Time and It's Changes.\u000a\u000aAlso, aside from the outro, when tymon and Michel go from the bar chord to the individual string picking is magical. 
p4687
aVFirst I heard this.. Dude... Eff yeah

p4693
(lp4694
VGod I love them so much! I must have seen them live nearing 10 times now and im still just as anxious to see them again as I was the very first time I ventured out. Such a talented bunch. 
p4695
aVI fanboy way too hard for them.
p4696
aVFOR THE SIMPLE IDEA OF CHEESEBURGERS.   Easily one of the funnest songs I've learned on bass.  I'm losing my shit wondering what their next album is going to sound like.  I'm guessing they're really far along in the recording process by this point and hopefully they'll release SOMETHING soon.
p4697
aVSuper stoked for it as well! Hopefully they'll release a new song some time in the spring cause the album is planned for a summer release!
p4698

VI love Frost*. Any of the long car rides I'm in I always make sure to have four albums. Crimson by Edge of Sanity, Experiments in Mass Appeal by Frost*, The Sham Mirrors by Arcturus and Andromeda Unchained by Anubis Gate. Makes any drive pleasant.
p4704
aVOne of the very best epics.\u000a\u000a"You and I, we will live and die, we are not the only survivors..."

asV[META] Improve your /r/progmetal browsing experience
p4707
(lp4708
VIs there a way I can filter out all of the whiny posts about all of my favorite bands being posted more frequently than others because they have large, dedicated fanbases and new material coming out this year?
p4709
aVThis is cool and I encourage others to use it as well. I'm not speaking on behalf of the other mods but so long as people follow the existing rules, whatever is posted is generally fine.  \u000a  \u000aThis happens in any music sub where a popular band is releasing something. I honestly think Corelia deserves to be posted as much as possible within the confines of the rules. They are not banking money like other popular prog bands. 20,000+ people don't browse the sub every day.  \u000a  \u000aAlso, the 3 people that do hit the report button helps *immensely*. It allows me to get to things quick, especially on mobile.  \u000a  \u000aI encourage all posts following a legal stream/release to be consolidated in a release discussion. But I really don't think there is anything to be done about hype, other than to continue to enforce the existing rules.
p4710
aVThere was a point about 6 months ago when everyone was posting Dream Theater, so there'd be about 3 DT songs a day. What if there was a rule that said to not post more than one thing per band a day. So for example, if someone posts an update about Corelia, they can't post a song by Corelia on the same day. Also no more than 1 song by a band per day would be neat. Obviously there could be some exceptions, like if someone was to have posted a song by PtH, and on that same day PtH announced a release date for their next album, you could post the article.\u000a\u000aThis isn't really a majour concern, and I don't think it's that necessary unless this sub gets much bigger. That being said, there's currently 6 Periphery posts on the front page including the discussion page, whereas /r/peripheryband is practically dead in comparison. If we encouraged everyone take more of the dicussion over there, we might be able to silence everyone who's complaining about the over-abundance of Periphery on here. 
p4711
aVEveryone is enjoying the periphery album, which JUST came out. They're one of the biggest names on the scene right now, sorry if we're "bloating" your feed with discussion about the new album. Besides that, if you can't simply scroll past the two or three Corelia/btbam posts per week then idk man.
p4712
aVIf you don't like my post you can simply filter it out using the keyword "[META] Improve your /r/progmetal browsing experience" on the RES filter page. \u000a\u000aGee, isn't that handy.
p4713
aVI've used RES, and it's a great tool. This could have been an informative post without you sounding like a total jackass. The mods aren't going to change the rules of the sub just because you throw a hissy fit when popular bands are mentioned more than others.
p4714
aV&gt; This could have been an informative post without you sounding like a total jackass.\u000a\u000aYou might not agree with him, but c'mon there's no need for namecalling.
p4715
aVNot everyone is enjoying the periphery album. I wouldn't say they're one of the biggest names on the scene either.
p4716
aVThe very fact that they're getting this much attention here would suggest otherwise....\u000aIt's cool if you don't like them, just don't act like everyone should adhere to your standards because you don't. People are excited about periphery right now, at least give it a few days to blow over.
p4717
aVI don't mind if they are posted here a lot. We already have a few filters, that I really like and use. It's just that we are not such a minority who couldn't care less about them, that you could say "everyone" is enjoying them. Most of the time I just upvote stuff I like and ignore the rest and I guess I am not the online one who does that.
p4718

aVI, for one, really could not care less about Periphery
p4720
aVNice! Glad for you man, thanks for letting us know.
p4721
aVI'm just saying that I agree with OP. I come to this sub to find new bands or get *occasional* updates on the more well known bands. If I wanted to see more about Periphery, I could go to their own subreddit, youtube, facebook, website, or any other vast wealth of strictly Periphery related sources. It gets pretty old when you see multiple posts about the same band on the front page, and nothing about anybody else
p4722
aV[deleted]
p4723
aVOne of the biggest names in the scene *just* released a new album. As for Corelia, one of the biggest "cult" names in the scene *just* announced that they were coming off of hiatus. I'm not sure how this level of discussion could be seen as either unreasonable or unexpected. This kind of thing only happens every couple years for any given band, and when a band of your choice has some similar type of newsworthyness, the same kind of thing will apply. People discuss what's relevant, period.\u000a\u000aYou still have the right to like and dislike what you see, but going around making statements like \u000a\u000a&gt;It'd be great if the mods could somehow amend their rules to tighten down on these (arguably) bloatful posts which have of late turned a subreddit about progressive metal as a genre into an advertisement board for a handful of bands.\u000a\u000amakes it seem like you feel someone has wronged you, which is ridiculous.
p4724
aVActually this is a good idea, I should filter out (and auto-downvote, if there is such a thing) any posts with the word "underrated" in the title.

p4741
aVI really like this! What albums from them do you recommend to start with?
p4742
aVIt depends on what kind of music you're into. I would recommend starting with the Acts. Act I, Act II, and Act III. You get a nice range of sounds. They're all part of the same concept piece and the music is phenomenal.

aVGoddamn, this is some good shit. 
p4752
aVYo, tentative live guitarist for the band here. The album is getting dropped April 21st, and a playthrough of Spark of the Archon is being made this weekend. Keep your eyes and ears open, big shit is about to happen for Native Construct.

p4754
aVWhen did they sign to Metal Blade Records? This is great news.
p4755
aVThey have actually been talking to Metal Blade since before my last semester here at Berklee. The story goes that BTBAM got a hold of Quiet World, presumably through Jamie King who recorded/engineered it along with "Colors." They officially announced their signing yesterday.  
p4756
aVabout time! been waiting for years for this album.
p4757
aVThat's some seriously fun music! The part starting around 2:45 reminds me of that one part in BTBAM's Specular Reflection. Just more drawn out and loungy haha.

aVVery strange. Very interesting.\u000a\u000aParts actually remind me of Mean's End?

aVIt's a DKA7 Pro. It comes with the kill switch and the maple neck, but I put bare knuckle juggernauts in it. Normally it comes with Dimarzio D Activators which are already amazing pickups

aVThis whole album is put together amazingly. The atmosphere never gets off track. Had no idea who these guys were until the PTH tour, but I've been a fan since.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking to get into the band, Dreambender seems to be the big hit. Everbound, Decades, and Heritage coming in after. 
p4793
aVYeah check out their only album as Today I Caught the Plague. It's called Lore. Same guys, just a name change since they wanted to go in a new direction. That album is also very good progressive metal.

p4806
(lp4807
VGreat post OP, this is cool!  I've been waiting for someone to decode this album, as I'm terrible with interpretations.  You even went the extra mile and backed up your ideas with actual real life events.  Some of which I might actually research at my own leisure.  Rainbow Gravity and 22 faces for sure.  \u000a\u000aSpeaking of Rainbow Gravity, with Jake's obsession with space and such, I'm willing to bet he was the one who named the song that.  Just a thought.  
p4808
aV[deleted]
p4809
aVThanks ! I bounced a lot of the ideas off my friend who turned me onto periphery /u/coffeescentedurine and he suggested I actually write it out ! Glad I did. 
p4810
aVI hope /u/iambulb sees this post! This was a wonderful interpretation, and really helps to appreciate the album beyond just the instruments and vocals. Great job! 
p4811
aVI've actually been looking at it as if the main character had some demon/entity infused with their own mind.\u000a\u000aThis would explain why sometimes the lyrics talk about "us" rather than "me". "22 faces" and "Psychosphere" also suggest to me this theme of multiple personalities (now even more so, with OPs references). \u000a\u000aThis would make "Four Lights" about the main character resisting the influence of this other entity, by acknowledging only the existing four lights (as per the Star Trek episode). And the line  \u201cStop fucking pulling, would you release the grip and let go?!" in "Psychosphere" would be this entity fighting for dominance.\u000a\u000aI've also been assuming that either the main character is actually a woman, or there is one in the story, maybe even one secondary character that also shares a consciousness with the main one.\u000a\u000aIn Alpha, Spencer sings "The bastard in *our* brain will chew until it bleeds", which suggests a struggle shared by two or more identities against this evil influence that also inhabits the main characters mind.\u000a\u000a I can't quite place it right now, but somewhere in the lyrics there is actually a mention to "her".\u000a\u000aIn "A Black Minute" the line "Embrace the feeling of our human skin\u000aintertwining now in ecstasy" seems to allude to the conception of a child during - and for the purposes of - this ritual, or the fusing of two lives through the ritual. Suggesting then, the presence of a man and a woman.\u000a\u000aReprise also suggests the presence of a male and a female to me, with the lines "A sacrifice in this duality" and "Our blessings given as the children moan".\u000a\u000aAlso, the OPs interpretation of "Rainbow Gravity" seems to be supported by the video for "Alpha", wherein a character plays a game called Rainbow Gravity to somewhat reverse some tragic events in his life, by bending time and space. So the song "Rainbow Gravity" seems to be about the main character considering the ability to turn their whole life around.\u000a\u000aAlthough I am sure there are broader themes in every song (i.e. change for humanity, as opposed to change for the main character).\u000a\u000aOne of such events seems to be him running over someone after deciding to drive drunk. I have come to strongly relate this to "Heavy Heart", where Spencer sings "As the water beads upon the window, turn the sad song up on the radio". But this might be a stretch on my end.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Had to change a word because proof reading three times was not enough to get it all right. Also, no **tl;dr** because this is actually the shorts I could make it.
p4812
aVYes, I definitely think it's a duality thing, where the main character is half possessed but still has free will.
p4813
aVThis is how I see it as well. The line in A Black Minute, "A birthing right in this duality, moon and sun" suggests this, as well as the corresponding line in Reprise, "A sacrifice in this duality." And the more literal line in Graveless "I feel Beelzebub inside me, he's been here all along."\u000a\u000aThere are also a couple songs/parts of songs I see as mainly being told from the perspective of the "demon." The verse in Psychosphere is a good example "Stop fucking pulling, will you release the grip and let go? I've got a life to life and a lot to end." Another example, though more subjective, is the chorus of The Bad Thing: "Isn't this desire that you're looking for, or is insanity just knocking on your door? Give me just a piece and surely you will find everything is better on the other side." I see this as the demon beckoning the protagonist to relinquish control and give in to his dark temptations. Just my interpretation.
p4814
aVThat was my interpretation as well. I also think at the end of the story during stranger things, that when the main character is going through rebirth or being freed from possession I thought about these lines:\u000a\u000a"Sounds of ambient voices lead me from nowhere, the skeletal mask brings a demon of the day" \u000a\u000aI felt like maybe the was the story cycling and the newborn baby being sacrificed/possessed by a demon and maybe the demon was him or something with a twist like that.
p4815
aVWhoa, I actually had this same thought! That would go along with the theme of "embracing the soul within" and what not. Cool theory.
p4816
aVI agree with the repeating, getting reborn part.  If you watch the alpha video and with the whole rainbow gravity theory, it makes since.  I also believe that the character gets possessed by a demon at some point, which takes him to hell.
p4817
aVFantastic summary.  I'm glad other people are into thinking critically about this stuff! 
p4818
aVThis is a great post!  I'm of the older generation, so Periphery isn't a band I have ever paid much attention to in this genre.  After reading this I have listened and paid attention a little more.  \u000a\u000aIt seems like this may be this generations Operation Mindcrime.  We'll see if it stands the test of time, but I love that our music is still moving forward!
p4819
aVThat is nearly exactly what I got out of it but you went into way more detail than I did. I also got some sort of theme in The Bad Thing of the main character/demon seeing through dimensions or transcending boundaries almost as if he is able to see earth and hell at the same time.\u000a\u000aI kind of got that from:\u000a\u000a"Sometimes there's a crack in the world that I can peer through, to see it for what it really is"\u000a\u000aand \u000a\u000a"There's an ugly face staring back, demons are everywhere."\u000a
p4820
aVLate to the party here, but what do you make of Scarlet and it's pretty solid connection to the album?
p4821
aVThis is really well thought out!
p4822
aVGreat job! Really loving the focus on the intertextuality. 
p4823
aVMore focused than [mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/Peripheryband/comments/2uftx4/my_interpretation_of_the_first_part_of_juggernaut) and certainly has more details (I didn't think of searching for a real life meaning of 22 Faces).\u000a\u000aI'd say this is the closest we'll get before the band's actual statement. Though there are several things which are not essential to the story that I think you got wrong (like A Black Minute) but the MK Ultra outro interpretation is awesome!
p4824

aVYou know, the bad thing about this post is how many people seemed to not get it
p4832
aVPeople are usually able to get stranger things than this. Oh well.
p4833
aVYou know I'd love to be! But sorry to break it to you like this: we just moved back out to our hometown in California!! I'll definitely miss the Chicago concert scene, but it's 73° out right now...\u000a\u000aI am trying to plan a quick trip out to catch Haken in April though! I knew it was coming, and I knew it was going to be Northeast only (like Pain of Salvation in 2013 and Leprous in 2014), so I've definitely been preparing myself for the heartbreak of missing it...BUT I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN!
p4834
aVAwesome man I definitely can't miss them either! I talked to /u/iamvillainmo and he is actually coming out for that too. 
p4835
aVI'm really sad that I didn't go. Got an update on how the show went?
p4836
aVTYS kicked ass but only played like 4 songs :(\u000a\u000aThe other two bands were pretty bad IMO although nothing more had a decent stage performance. \u000a\u000aPeriphery was so fucking tight though, the crowd was going crazy. Mark and Misha both I believe let a couple people finger their guitars ;). Nolly got his fan out at the end and cooled off the audience. Oh and spencer grabbed this kids gopro and ran around the stage with it. 
p4837
aVDamn, I wish I could have made it!
p4838
asVSubstructure - "Canis Minor". Fantastic band with only an EP from 2011. Some "Exoplanet" vibes here.
p4839
(lp4840
VToo bad this band broke up. They were so good, like a mix between The Contortionist and Veil of Maya
p4841
aVthe vocals are a little bit too generic deathcore style for me, but the music in this EP is 2d0p3. I havent listened to this in forever thank you for the reminder OP!
p4842
aVThey also have an unreleased 2013 compilation of pre-production songs. Search for them in torrent sites (the songs were released through Facebook by some guys from the band, but then other dude from the band refused and some weird confusion ensued)

VThis is the best king Crimson cover ever. 
p4853
aV[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgLLKdttTcM) is a close second but I'm not sure I would call it a cover when two of the three guys on stage are King Crimson veterans.\u000a\u000aThey did this song live in Dallas on the last tour and it was amazing.
p4854
aVWas thinking of posting this yesterday, the original I mean. Still I love both!
p4855
aVThe first two Larks' Toungues were brilliant.  Should really be required listening in prog metal, as it's been such an influence on so many bands.  Crimson is like the first prog metal act.

asVMastodon- The Last Baron. "I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze..."
p4857
(lp4858
VThis song gives me chills for 13 minutes straight. I always forget that's even possible until I listen to this song again. Especially that recapitulation at 9:23. UGH. I can't even handle the amount of epic. 
p4859
aVI obviously agree 100%.
p4860
aVYeah, this was the perfect one for long jogs. Maybe the most extravagant Mastodon song ever. Always dug the operatic vocal keyboards and the down and dirty metal section in...maybe 10/16? "Cyanide he craves" section...
p4861
aVFunny you should mention that as this accompanied me on part of my 3 mile jog today. Running never felt so trippy haha. And yeah, definitely either 10/16 or 10/8 there, grouped as 3+3+2+2.
p4862
aVHaha I had no idea what riff you guys were talking about till the 3+3+2+2. What is a recapitulation? 
p4863
aVIn its most simple terms it means a musical theme that is revisited. \u000a\u000a\u000aGoing a little more in depth for the sake of of providing a TIL, a recapitulation is the third movement of a piece written in sonata form. Sonata form was first developed during the Classical/Romantic music time periods through composers like Mozart/Beethoven/Schubert etc but still persists today through many mediums of music. \u000a\u000aSonata form consists of 3 main movements, or in the case of The Last Baron, sections. The 1st movement (0:00-3:15) being the exposition, much like a story, where the main theme and key (tonal center) of the piece is presented. The exposition also normally includes brief musical hints of what's to come in the 2nd movement/section of the piece (3:15-9:25) which is called the development. This is where key changes may occur and the main theme diverges into and expands upon different musical ideas. The 3rd movement is the recapitulation (9:25-11:15) where the song returns to the first melody/theme and back to the initial tonal center. Sonata form can also include what are known as codas, which can be thought of as a sort of outro, which The Last Baron does from around the 11:15 minute mark to the end.\u000a\u000a\u000aRecapitulation. :) 
p4864
aVThanks for such a detailed response. Not sure I would have understood had I have looked it up online. 
p4865
aVExactly!  Set up my playlist for a half marathon the year this came out so that this song would carry me to the finish.  Such a great jam.
p4866
aVWay off-topic, but are people generally pretty cool with you wearing headphones in marathons? I like long-distance running, but haven't entered any serious races, and am wondering if other races/officials would discourage it. 
p4867
aVDepends on the race.  Some disallow them.  
p4868
aV[hall of fame](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/wiki/mastodon). your post will probably be deleted, as per the rules of the sub, sorry.

aVThe fact that's it's the number 1 in there makes it even funnier.
p4870
aVOh snap. I'm sorry, I didn't even realize! I was just jamming to the song this morning and wanted to geek out about it. I'm happy this song is number one in the Hall of Fame. Well deserved!
p4871
aVNo problem, and I'm glad you chose to post this during the sub's downtime, rather than posting it when it's the busiest in order get more karma, I'm pretty sure the regulars here are fully aware that there are too many songs on here that get 100+ karma, while the rest of the posts that day struggle to get 20.
p4872
aVYeah, no that's definitely not my intention. I don't even understand the whole comment/link karma grabbing nonsense. I used to frequent one or two metal forums during my high school years, talked to people daily for the sake of chatting and talking music alone, fell out of touch in college because, busy, and now am here to get back into a community and to share, talk and discover some cool sounds. I'd never intentionally try and bury other links for virtual internet points haha
p4873
aVWell you won't find any better metal discussion on reddit than in here. I don't think that people that just post Protest The Hero/Periphery/Dream Theater all the time are deliberately trying to hide posts, it's just that they don't care if other posts get buried. Unfortunately this makes it difficult to post bands that don't get talked about much on here, people only want to upvote the bands they've already heard.
p4874
aVNope, I won't. :) I've discovered that over the past few months. And it's not just because I have a penchant for progressive music either. The discussions here are always really civil, lighthearted but intelligent when need be. Just what I've been itching for. \u000a\u000a\u000aAs a contributer to the sub I regularly try and check out any bands I've never heard of and upvote if I dig it. It's kind of why I'm here haha. Like this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2qqns0/new_single_from_canadian_progmetal_group_nok/?sort=confidence I've been listening to this bands debut album nonstop since this post. Didn't get anywhere near enough love. 
p4875
aVDon't worry, people care way too much about getting up and downvoted
p4876
aVWhoa, Hearts Alive is #10 on the list?? I would've thought it would be way higher.
p4877
aVDefinitely gonna get deleted but I haven't heard this song in a long time. The word epic gets thrown around a lot nowadays but this is a fucking epic tune. Thanks man
p4878
aVRight! There's no other adjective I can think of to better describe this. It fits perfectly. And now that I am aware of the Hall of Fame it looks like Blackest Eyes by Porcupine Tree did not get deleted so I'm hoping this is allowed to survive for discourse sake, but it's fine if it's not as I'm sure all my kindred spirits on here already know and love this tune. 
p4879
aVAbsolutely! Only one that compares for me is Hearts Alive which I'd have to say is my say is my favorite song because it represents everything I love about the band
p4880
aVHearts Alive is the sludgiest of sludge. Like the from scratch hot chocolate I tried to make the other night that I simmered way too long and ended up struggling to sip on a drink with pudding-esque consistency. 
p4881
aVStill though, this one wins out for me, if only because of the transitions and diversity of sound. I still, to this day, struggle to figure out the time signatures between the 6 minute mark and 6:20. Love that little dose of crazy! 
p4882
aVKiller end to a killer album. 
p4883
aVGreat song. I haven't listened to Mastodon in ages so the fact that it hasn't been deleted yet makes me really happy.
p4884
aVI remember seeing Mastodon on the tour they did after this album in 2010. They played the entire album straight through and they had this trippy movie on a screen at the back of the stage that went with the story/lyrics. Hearing this song live was like an out of body experience.
p4885
aVIf you want to relive that night, get their Live At the Aragon album. It's a recording of their Chicago performance of that tour, and it comes with a DVD of the concert. 
p4886
aVI actually have that album. They did a really good job of recording that show.
p4887
aVTotally. They even had a keyboard player to do all those parts. They were at the top of their game too, seen them twice more since then and it just wasn't the same.

aVI was at that show too. NeO were absolutely amazing and Beyond Creation were excellent as well.
p4897
aVSo glad to see that Tim has gotten much better at both playing the violin and singing live. I watched some lives from them a while ago and his performance at both were... a bit disappointing.\u000a\u000aI know they're not or used to not be a full time band and each member had full time jobs and all so I understand him not being able to train much, but it was a bit saddening to me.

VDanny Walker killed it. Also dat bass tone.
p4901
aVWonderful album, love the fact that they took a turn in direction as opposed to sticking with the same death metal sound as Demonocracy and Gloom.
p4902
aVCompletely agree! Hope they stick with it, this album is awesome.
p4903
aVWell, I didn't expect I'd listen to Job for a Cowboy today.\u000a\u000aAnd I certainly didn't expect I'd actually *enjoy* it.
p4904
aVHaha, I know how you feel. I remember JFAC when they were just another deathcore band, now they're making awesome metal. Can't complain there!
p4905
aVSame! I'm happy to see they're experimenting. Is that a fretless bass? Very Steve DiGiorgio.
p4906
aVIt sounds like it's a fretted bass, but he's totally playing it as if it were a fretless one.  I kind of like the tone he's getting out of it; the transition between notes is just the slightest bit jarring rather than smooth on the fretless.  His playing is competent so the sound stays intact as he straight dances around the fretboard.  Most intriguing metal bass of 2014 that's for sure.
p4907
aVI'll have to give the full album a listen later tonight before I give it the most intriguing metal bass of last year award. But if you haven't heard it, check out Beyond Creation's "Earthborn Evolution" record from last year.
p4908
aVI just listened to that whole album tonight and I'm probably going to listen to it a million more times. It's so good!
p4909
aVI hadn't heard it but I have now.  Earthborn Evolution was inspirational to listen to as a bass player.  It can have the superlative, lol.  But the bass in the new JFAC record was certainly the most surprising of the year.  Never would have expected it to sound that way--stepped up in terms of complexity and melody, even given some lead lines.
p4910
aVI'll definitely give you surprising- the bass is a big reason why I was so shocked to hear this JFAC track in the first place. I'm very impressed with their direction.\u000a\u000aGlad I could introduce you to BC, too!
p4911
aVThis was exactly me the first time I checked this album out.  It's pretty damn good, to my surprise.  Wonder if they still totally blow live.
p4912
aVI don't know what era you saw them live, but in my personal experience seeing them, they absolutely went in. That was during their touring cycle for Ruination. The only time I've gone more buck wild at a concert was when I saw Meshuggah. 
p4913
aVTheir new album is so fantastic. Their best work yet. I was a huge fan of Democracy, but this was just on a whole different level.

p4918
aVI like this. Thank you for your input!
p4919
aVCaligula's Horse has been mentioned. Other fairly popular groups on this sub include Karnivool (personal second favorite of mine), Between the Buried and me, Protest the Hero, Cloudkicker, Disperse, and Ne Obliviscaris. Certainly not EVERYTHING prog metal has to offer, but that's a good smattering of styles to start with.\u000a\u000aHonestly, I'd start by choosing a singing style you tend to like and look through. Give stuff a general listen, and if you like it, dig through their discography a little more. That's how I tend to find good artists on this sub.
p4920
aVThanks. I will check out a couple of those as soon as I can. I know about BTBAM and have seen them live on the Summer Slaughter tour with Cannibal Corpse. I don't remember their performance too much because I was drunk, lol, but I'll have to listen to them again.
p4921
aVLeprous, Intervals, Animals as Leaders, Myrath, Karnivool, Porcupine Tree, Cloudkicker, Disperse and Haken are a couple of my favorites and all worth listening to! As for Periphery I didn't like them upon first listen either. But after giving P2 numerous listens they're probably one of my favorite bands. Give it some time and you'll probably feel the same way 
p4922
aVThanks. I know of Animals as Leaders (they're from my regional area). Definitely know about Porcupine Tree. Steven Wilson is a great musician. Other than that, will definitely check out what you mentioned. Thank you!
p4923
aVYou can also check out progarchive.com , it is pretty easy to find what you want there since they have sub-genres of prog.
p4924
aVCheck out The Safety Fire. Here's the video for their song [Yellowism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0bv6zvUSPc). They play this beautiful style with lots of contrast. The music is both heavy and beautiful. Menacing and Enchanting. Like a Jagwar :D\u000a\u000amore great bands: Protest The Hero, Between The Buried And Me, The Contortionist, SikTh, Destrage, Dionaea, The Dillinger Escape Plan, The Ocean...\u000a\u000aI also *REALLY* love Periphery. I'm actually wearing a shirt right now :D Their newest double album Juggernaut is an emotional masterpiece in my opinion, although a bit transparent after many listens. Their other releases are great too.
p4925
aVCorelia is great.
p4926
aVI'm going to second Karnivool, their first album is my favourite, but the second is still awesome after you give it a bit of time. But yeah, check them out, you won't regret it!
p4927
aVRiverside, Intronaut, Cynic, Exivious, Haken, Headspace, Pain of Salvation, Devin Townsend, Ayreon, Anathema, Distorted Harmony, Oceansize, Gojira.  A pretty wide range of stuff right there, and none of it really in the direction of Periphery's style of music since you're not digging that.
p4928
aVYou may dig this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfF_TsvJzrA
p4929
aVCheck out skyharbor if you like tesseract, especially their new album, guiding lights. It has a lot of atmospheric passages like tesseract does. They also both have the same singer, but he isn't the same guy that sang on altered state. 
p4930
aVThank you all so much. I really appreciate everyone's suggestions and thoughts. I will definitely have something to do for a few hours this weekend and I look forward to it.
p4931
aVTry Uneven Structure.  They're groovy and atmospheric like TesseracT but a bit heavier.  The vocal style is polarizing, but I like it.  the cleans aren't so high pitched.  Almost alt-sounding.  Their album Februus is pretty killer.

p4936
aVNot to mention it's King fuckin' Crimson! They ought to be required reading for this place.
p4937
aVHaha that was my immediate reaction. I just listened to In The Court of the Crimson King again on Sunday night in an attempt to show my bf the origins of prog metal and ease him into some of the heavier stuff I'm into and it just blew my mind all over again. Like it does every single time I spin that record. \u000a\u000aI also facepalmed hard when his first reaction was, "oh yeah! Kanye West totally sampled this!" \u000a\u000aKing Crimson's music is timeless!
p4938
aVSpeaking of Kanye, I first heard KC when they were sampled in Power, that led me to look into their back catalogue, and now here I am a regular in /r/progmetal.
p4939
aVThat's completely awesome! :D Out of curiosity is that how you got into prog metal in general? What did you mainly listen to before discovering the sub genre? 
p4940
aVI'll try and remember. I've been into metal since 2007/2008ish, and I think by the time Power came out I had already heard Leviathan by Mastodon, or some other prog metal band. I found out that my favourite part of Power was sampled from KC, so I looked them up, found out they were progressive (which at the time I mostly knew as the stuff my guitar teacher always told me about, but at that point I had never listened to much). I then looked up their songs on youtube, thought it was great, so I decided to look up more of these progressive bands. Since I was already into metal, I decided to listen to the names I'd heard of, like Opeth, BTBAM, Barren Earth etc. Eventually I stopped listening to regular metal bands and just started listening to Prog mostly. Probably not as interesting as you would have hoped, I might have made it sound like I was a hip hop fan that converted to Prog Metal haha. I did buy My Dark Beautiful Twisted Fantasy when it came out, but that was an unusual purchase for me at the time.
p4941
aVHaha no I love hearing about how people end up down the progressive metal rabbit hole. Always interesting! I was mostly asking because, as I said, I've been trying to get my bf into the sub genre, even just into harder rock and grunge like APC, AIC etc over the past few months and was interested to see how predisposed to liking the genre you were.\u000a\u000aApparently pretty predisposed haha. \u000a\u000aAlso, sounds like you had yourself a pretty cool guitar teacher! 
p4942
aVWhat's Adrian up to these days?
p4943
aVUnfortunately not taking part in this. Instead the very mediocre Jakko Jakszyk is on vocals for this tour.
p4944
aVKC without Belew is a cover band.\u000a\u000a/Aw snap! Bring on the downvotes...
p4945
aVNot going to downvote, but what about their great cataloge in 1969-1975?
p4946
aVThe John Wetton-fronted KC is outstanding. The first album is pretty darn good, and was probably pretty bewildering when it came out. Personally, I always feel like the public opinion on it (especially on Reddit) is a bit overblown, at least in comparison to '72 onwards. The Belew-fronted stuff is my hands-down favorite band (maybe Zeppelin comes close for me). All the '72 and onwards groups are electrifying. For me, the '70-72 period is weak and never gets played at my house. Jakko is a fine musician, but to replace Belew with him is sacrilege to me, and I skipped the tour, which I have never done since '95. 21st Century Schizoid Band was boring as hell and now KC  has become that. Never thought Fripp would get nostalgic.\u000a\u000aOf course, that's just my opinion, man. \u000a\u000a
p4947
aVI guess it's mostly just because every era of Crim is different.  I guess everyone has parts they don't like.  I personally don't think that the 80s was that good beyond Discipline, but you probably like Three Of A Perfect Pair and Beat.  I love Larks Tounges, Starless, and Red.  Everyone has a different idea of the best Crimson.\u000a\u000aAnyways, even bad Crimson is better than most bands in their good era's.

(lp4997
VThese guys are so god damn next level for thier age... The drummer JUST turned 18!! :\u005c \u000a\u000aBut really... This may have been the most beautiful thing I've heard in a really long time. Very fuckin stoked for these guys, and I'm proud as hell to be living in a time where so much of what I never even KNEW I wanted in music could be so accessible to me. I hope others feel the same, because it feels amazing. 
p4998
aVWhen I first heard CHON, it was one of those things where I got down on my own abilities a little and had those creeping "you should just give up now" thoughts in the back of my mind. Just gotta remember to keep pushing. Finding them has turned out to be one of the best things for me. \u000a\u000aAwesome dudes, too. Chilled and mingled after their set when they opened for AAL.
p4999
aVSorry to hijack the first comment but you guys might really like the songs off of /r/mathrock, seeing how Chon is straight up mathrock...
p5000
aVThis song is very warm and angular and twinkley. I love it so much. Just great composition and musicianship here. \u000a\u000aI hope others here frequent the math rock subreddit as well as there are so many genre crossovers. I think next to prog metal, math rock is my next most listened to genre. Good recommendation! 
p5001
aVThis song maybe, but i wouldn't say all their stuff is. Elliptical Illuminations is straight up prog metal. A lot of their stuff though yeah is either math rock or on the fence between the two.
p5002
aVThe ending was gorgeous. So psychedelic.
p5003
aVThese guys need to play at festivals. They would mesmerize the people on acid and shrooms.
p5004
aVI can't even imagine the amount of pure, unadulterated joy that CHON would inspire in someone using acid. It's already hard for me to wrap my head around how good their music makes me feel- To be on that level would be nuts.

aVHuge fan, interestingly I think this is the first time I've heard them play with more than just an amp haha.
p5030
aVJust a heads up guys, Sumerian is censoring any comments of any negative connotation. Chon themselves took the ability for me to comment on their posts, which according to them was because I said "see you suck fucks at the show"? I went to see them live but was skeptical when Woohoo first released because it was identical sounding to NS. Because of this they said I was threatening them.  I've bought every release they've put out so far, and they are some straight up divas now. \u000a\u000aRegardless, that doesn't justify Sumerian deleting the comment that got 20 upvotes regarding Chon as a One Trick, formulatic pony. A few other posts have been deleted, I wish I had print-screened cause I joked with my lady friend as I posted my two cents that it would likely get deleted too. Sure enough. \u000a\u000aPeople's voices are being censored and it's kinda sad to be honest. 
p5031
aVI remember replying to your comment on youtube and I don't see it there, but my comment that is a bit critical is still there, and some other negative comments are there.\u000a\u000aI agree their songs all sound so similar and it's because all of them are based on a maj7 chord structure. 
p5032
aVIm gonna have to stick my two cents and be brutally honest, this is boring as hell. Couldnt keep my interest at all. Theyre definitely talented musicians but i just dont know what it is about them, theyve always been missing a certain factor for me, it all sounds the same too.
p5033
aVI agree. I used to really like CHONs demos and much older material, but their last two releases bore me to death. Its bland and a little formulaic sounding. Theyre basing their whole writing style completely around maj7 arpeggios and little flurries of tapping lines interspersed throughout. I want them to go back to things like Mountains of Creation
p5034
aVYeah, Mountains of Creation has always stood out as one of my favorites. The thing I've started to notice about all of my favorite artists is that, once they become full-time, professional musicians, after their first releases, their work loses a bit of the passion and particularity of when they were doing it 100% for fun.\u000a\u000aThat being said, it's all still great, well made stuff, and I'm completely interested in what these guys will do in the future.
p5035
aVI dont think they've lost the passion, they've just matured a lot and their musical tastes changed. When they wrote their demo stuff they were still in their early teens. They've mentioned in interviews that before Woohoo they really started to enjoy Tigran Hamasyan and became rather heavily influenced by him in their new music. 
p5036
aVI think you misunderstand me. I don't doubt that they love making the music just as much as before, rather that they don't have the time to devote themselves as wholly to the writing process, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. Touring, recording, pr, and all of the other aspects that come along with their increased recognition and professional status seem to make it harder for any artist to follow through with their process as completely and freely as they did at first. It's just a slight loss of freedom, and rise in expectation. But, like I said, it doesn't mean I think any less of their current material. It's not a decline in quality, rather an increase in pressure on their personal artistry/intricacies.\u000a\u000aI notice this in a range of musicians from Thelonious Monk, to Omar Rodriguez Lopez, to Kanye West. \u000a\u000a
p5037
aVI agre, personally I get the impression that their song-writing itself just isn't all there yet. If you look at \u000aNewborn Sun, it felt kind of all over the place. The songs felt more like "hey we are gonna jam for 3 minutes and call it a song" rather than actually having some sort of framework.
p5038
aVI've gotta agree...I usually love match rock / whatever post kind of stuff you want to relate them too...but theres something about Chon that never fully stuck for me. I like it well enough - but I never get the urge to seek them out or put any of their music on unless I stumble across it. \u000a\u000aThe newer the songs get the less interesting they are getting as well. Maybe in time it'll click for me =\u005c
p5039
aVMeh all their stuff starts to sound the same after a while.
p5040
aVI personally like "reliable" bands.
p5041
aV[deleted]
p5042
aVI've listened through Newborn Sun maybe 10 times, what I like is that their style didn't change too much. This is their style and it is original. I think this new album is gonna be good. 
p5043
aVYo, what's up with that snare?  It's total weaksauce.
p5044
aVYeah, it could have a bit more snap, but I feel like their drum sounds have always been pretty underwhelming. Can we talk about the feel change Nathan kills at 3:10?
p5045
aVsuch a cool change of feel right there, put quite the smile on my face
p5046
aVTheir overall tone is kind of flat sounding, for what they're doing. I got used to it and now it's just a part of it for me. It feels like it belongs.

p5055
aVsweet
p5056
aVAbout fucking time. What even was Migrant.
p5057
aVCasey has stated more than once that he didn't want to become a "concept band." Migrant was a way to add lighter songs so he doesn't have to kill his voice singing on tour like he would have to if he only sang songs from Act II/Act III (also he wanted a way to express himself that wasn't tied to a concept). I loved Migrant but fuck I am excited to see the Acts finally getting finished up.
p5058
aVSo he made a sub-par album for the sake of the longevity of his band? I don't buy it. 
p5059
aVWell, I hardly think Casey believes it's subpar.
p5060
aVCompared to his earlier works, I'd be shocked to learn he doesn't. 
p5061
aVConsidering he's frequently spoken about how much he loves that record and he's glad he did it, I don't think so.
p5062
aVSource? 
p5063
aVYou already seem to have convinced yourself that you and EVERYONE else in the world, Casey included, dislikes Migrant. It's a great album. If you want interviews where Casey talks about him liking Migrant, then do a simple google search. 
p5064
aVI understand that The Dear Hunter is a prog band and that there's a lot of overlap in fanbases between them and the bands normally posted here. I also understand that we're cool with allowing non-prog metal songs to be posted every now and then because of that overlap between fanbases and interests. That said, can we not make this a hub for non-prog metal news?
p5065
aVthis is pretty minimal.  The Dear Hunter Act series is their most progressive work and they announce the next album.  It is very related, and it's just one band.  It's hardly turning into a "hub." 
p5066
aVThat's great, but they're not a metal band. Post it at /r/progrockmusic.
p5067
aVthere are a lot of bands posted here that aren't metal, which is a hard genre to define anyway. get over it.
p5068
aVI don't like to define genres. I know Rush is obviously rock and Between the Buried and Me is obviously metal, but there is a whole spectrum in between that can go either way. 
p5069
aVDude, I'm totally cool with that! I would just rather hear their music than their tour announcements, new albums, etc. Post a song every week or two, I don't care. But if I want to find news about my favorite prog rock bands, I don't expect to or want to find it here.

p5104
aVI really want to like this band, because the instrumentals really are interesting. A performance at the White River Amphitheater near Seattle, WA absolutely ruined them for me.\u000a\u000aThey had the worst live sound that I've ever heard, to this day (even compared to notoriously shitty performers like Bring Me the Horizon, or Asking Alexandria, yes I listen to metalcore too). The singer would repeatedly go on these egotistical tirades about how shitty our crowd was. Pretentious is the best word I can describe him, without involving expletives.\u000a\u000aEventually, someone got the nerve to throw a bottle of piss at the singer. It missed, but hit the guitarists stack, shorting it out. They had to walk off stage after, the crowd finally got tired of his shit.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't anyone else in the band, it was just the singer. Is he always like that? He comes off really cocky in interviews.\u000a
p5105
aVThomas Pridgen would agree with you. 
p5106
aVWell, he *was* the drummer when I saw them (2006). But wasn't he just as crazy? Didn't he get kicked out for pissing on their tour bus or something?
p5107
aVBoth he and their guitarist were known for being pretty full of themselves. The band's history of going through band members like a fat kid goes through cake speaks pretty clearly about that.\u000a\u000aAs for their live sound, I've seen vids of their performances that were really good, and some that were absolute junk. As good as they were in studio, they did seem...inconsistent live.
p5108
aVWell I mean, when you look at their later releases and there's a big blurb basically shitting on the remainder of the band that isn't Cedric and Omar, you can understand exactly why they went through as many musicians as they did.\u000a\u000a&gt;The partnership between Omar Rodríguez-López &amp; Cedric Bixler-Zavala is The Mars Volta. These compositions are then performed by The Mars Volta Group.\u000a\u000aAs far as I was aware, Omar would basically write and arrange all the music and then tell the other musicians in the studio what to play.  I'd grow pretty tired of that if I were Jon Theodore or Thomas Pridgen.
p5109
aVThis whole album! Drunkship of lanterns always gets me going though.
p5110
aVThis song and album are my favorite. But almost anything Cedric and Omar do together is magic.  RIP IKEY  
p5111
aVLove that it's using triple meter.\u000aIt's practically a waltz.\u000aSuch an imaginative band.
p5112
aVSongs in 3 aren't exactly uncommon...
p5113
aVHe just wanted us all to know that he knows what 3:4 is
p5114
aVIs that some kind of arcane knowledge to you?
p5115
aVSuch an imaginative band
p5116
aVDid you know that in this song the guitarist actually used an electric guitar? Maybe a little out there for some people but I think these guys are blazing a bold new trail in music that others may follow!
p5117
aVI heard they sang the songs with words 
p5118
aVI don't know any other in rock/metal song from the top of my head...\u000aMaybe some parts here and there, but the whole song? It's kind of a unique characteristic.\u000aIt's what is drawing me to the song mainly...
p5119
aV3/4 is the most common meter after 4/4 for songs (or even most western music) to be in. True, in progmetal you might not have as many songs that remain in 3/4 for the entire time, but that's because prog music is often characterized by changing meters. Hell, this Mars Volta song doesn't even remain in 3/4 the whole song, the section around 2:15 changes meter. \u000a\u000aHowever, within the general rock and metal spectrum, on any given album you'll have a couple songs in 3, stereotypically the more ballad-esque songs, but not uniformly.\u000a\u000aExample: Let's take a fairly standard rock album, let's say by Yellowcard just so that I don't have to really do any research, a band that was fairly popular for a while that is certainly one of my guilty pleasures, mainly because Longineau Parsons is a pretty tasty drummer, and the addition of violin shows that they at least *tried* to make their music slightly unique, even though much of their music was run-of-the-mill. Not that I'm making excuses for my enjoyment ;)\u000a\u000aAnyway, on my favorite Yellowcard Album, Lights and Sounds, there's 2 songs in in 3/4: [City of Devils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxCxccmACrQ) and [How I Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQCJRbFT79Y). And they're not a particularly imaginative band.\u000a\u000aIn metal, I pulled up literally the most recently added album to my music library, Shattered Skies' 2015 debut full-length "The World We Used to Know". While they're more on the progressive side of things, and have more asymmetrical or changing meters, they still have the song [Elegance and Grace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjc8EQiRpbo) which is in 3/4.\u000a\u000aGroupings of three are quite common in music, whether it's in the overall meter (duple vs. triple) or in the classification of subdivision (simple vs. compound, compound having triplet subdivisions loved by any band going for a shuffle-y or groovy feel. In other words, most of Monuments' catalog).\u000a\u000aHowever, in your defense, the constant 3 against 4 polyrhythm between the drums vs. the guitar and bass lines **is** very cool, since the guitars obfuscate the fact that there is the underlying triplet meter. It doesn't sound immediately like it's in three, only when you starting hearing the cross rhythm of the high hat and whatnot do you catch that 'waltz-ish' pulse.
p5120
aVOf course 3/4 is the most common meter after 4/4. But that wasn't my point.\u000a\u000aIn rock and metal in comparison to 4/4 (which is called common time for a reason) the 3/4 time signature is beaten in number by such a large margin, that it is a unique feature.\u000aEspecially when used so prominantly in a song, that you could dance a waltz to it (nearly) throughout.\u000a\u000aI'm not really a fan of rock- or metal-ballads so maybe one can find more instances of it there.\u000a\u000aEven breaking the rythmical monotony through triplets or the switch to another time signature is a very rare occasion in rock/metal (outside of prog).\u000a\u000aOne of my personal high points in music is the merging of two rythms which seem to be working against each other at first.\u000aExample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5HxhQMi5RI (the beginning)

p5183
(lp5184
V[White Arms of Athena's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPpTfqlERzE) first album, Astrodama, might be a version of Colors from an alternate dimension. It's eerie how similar they sound to BTBAM at times, but they're still excellent.\u000a\u000aThe newest self-titled album, though...I'm still trying to process just what the fuck happened. My worst disappointment of 2014.\u000a\u000a**Edit:** Also, I have to mention the band that got me into the more metalcore side of things, Last Chance to Reason. [Level 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rxnTPfyoTY) is easily one of my favorite albums. Think Between the Buried and Me if they decided to do a cyberpunk concept album about epic battles with computer viruses.
p5185
aVI thought the new album was hit and miss, not necessarily anything like their first - not bad just way different. \u000a\u000aI do remember the first time I heard Astrodrama though I thought immediately of BTBAM.
p5186
aVYeah, I liked the singles they released and was interested in the more sludge/post-metal vibe I was getting from it. I still like 4 of the actual songs (would have been five if the drone intro to The Transition was shorted by 4 four minutes), and I appreciate that they really took some big risks and experimented, but that album just lost me too much. I've still been going back to it, so maybe it'll grow on me.
p5187
aVI'll say it every time. Black Crown Initiate. Look up their EP, Song for the Crippled Bull. Then go to the full length.  The EP I'd a masterpiece.
p5188
aVI was not too impressed with the full length
p5189
aVThe full length was excellent, they just decided to get a lot heavier than their initial EP. When you consider the EP was essentially just one long song, there was a lot of different directions they could have taken the new album.
p5190
aVHonestly, I thought the full length was okay. [But the EP is beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhY8-iJnZ-M).
p5191
aVI've always thought the band [The Odious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peW4wjfc894) reminded me of the musical style of BTBAM. They are more raw, but have tons of versatility and on top of that they are all great musicians.

asVMy Band - "Möbius Lung"
p5230
(lp5231
VIf you're interested in recording better quality songs, I'd recommend getting into music production. There's all sorts of software such as amp modeling software that allow you to create quality sounding music on a low or nonexistent budget.
p5232
aVAre you talking about a college course? 
p5233
aVNo, there's loads of information online. Assuming you have decent hardware, everything can be done from your computer.
p5234
aVYeah, I have Audacity and the H2n came with a program called Wavelab. I use both of them to kinda mess around with the equalizer and compressors and that kind of thing. I don't really have advanced experience with that stuff, but I can at least say that the recordings sound a lot better after I use Wavelab to find a good EQ. 
p5235
aVLook into DAWs, man. The same people that make Wavelab make a great DAW called Cubase. Audacity and Wavelab are really basic programs for messing around with audio files, but DAWs are amazing from music production. There's definitely a lot to learn, but it's totally worth it if you're passionate about making/recording music.
p5236
aVThanks, man! I will definitely keep that in mind. Is there a specific link you could share with me that will get me started in this journey to become better at recording music? 
p5237
aV[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i00E-O0cafA) guy is very informative. He has a series for metal production. I'm what's called a "bedroom producer", so besides some midi keyboards an audio interface (Line 6 UX2), I rely heavily on software. Software can get pricey, but there are always ways of acquiring it in different ways.
p5238
aVFor guitar stuff I'd recommend you get a virtual amp system.  Native Instruments Guitar Rig is one. It emulates all the equipment so you can get a fairly decent sound recording guitar into the computer.  You might even consider an electronic drumkit for the drums to make production easier, but that's up to you.
p5239
aVWell, that's where it's getting into a lot of money and we just don't have that right now. Thanks, though, for your input. Right now, our goal is to get some new cymbals and a bassist so we can start playing shows and then I guess we'll see where it goes from there. Once we start making some extra money, we'll start building a home studio, but that's way down the road. 
p5240
aVGood luck
p5241
aVThanks, man.
p5242
aVTo be honest, virtual amps aren't what I'd call worth it.  Hard to use live unless it's AxeFX II ($2k), and the sound isn't better than a cab.  In many metal scenes, especially prog metal/djent, people have a love affair with amp sims, but they're not always going to be better or worse.  They can be expensive and you can get a Peavey 5150 for less than $700 bucks and you can use them in recordings and live.\u000a\u000aIn the end, with production, just do what feels and sounds right to you.  Maybe an amp sim is perfect for you.
p5243
aVIn terms of a DAW, you can get Reaper.  It's "free" in that the demo is unlimited in time and content and there are no real restrictions.  An actual license is relatively cheap, too.\u000a\u000aI've used Guitar Rig for amp emulation for a while and it gets the job done for a hobbyist like me.  A license for that is relatively pricey, but I think there's a fairly limited free version to try it out.  I also occasionally use Amplitube; it's a similar program that's the same cost.  I find each program is better at different things generally, so I mix it up.\u000a\u000aHere's an example of what I've been able to do with all these with fairly limited knowledge: https://soundcloud.com/ryanimation02/torpedo-tuxedo\u000a(plus crappy digital drums from the program Reason)
p5244
aVNice! It sounds pretty damn good. It definitely sounds a lot crisper than what I've recorded with the H2n. Thanks for the info, man. This is all a good start to my future of recording much higher quality music! 
p5245
aVWorth noting you'll also probably need a recording interface for your computer, which is another hurdle money-wise.  I'm probably not the best guy to ask for a recommendation there.
p5246
aVWell, it'll take a while before I can start doing stuff like this. I just need to start making some extra money from playing shows and selling merch or something along those lines, but if I can eventually be in a position where I can make my own music and not have to pay someone else to do it, it'll all be worth it. 
p5247
aVFirst off, like Bujjick stated, get reaper.  I use a 400$ daw and I tried reaper after and it literally does the same thing,  the sound quality is based in your interface.  Get a USB interface like a saffire 6 usb.  It's not the most expensive but it will record high quality tracks.  It is my recommendation to only use quick recording modules like the one you have as a reference tool for jam sessions and writing.  Next,go to http://lepouplugins.blogspot.com and download a lecab 2 and look up on YouTube how to use it.  You need impulses for the cab simulation, so you can either find free ones online,  or try out redwirez for higher quality impulses at 10$ each, I use the engl and bogner from them.   Try out any of the free amp sims from lepouplugins.blogspot.com and put them in your fx chain.   This should give you a decently high quality sound after done tweaking.  To get it set up right just go online and there are loads of tutorials.  Sorry for the long post but you can make music on a budget these days and I'm surprised when people still don't know how. So get to work :-) 
p5248
aVWell, thanks for the advice. I really appreciate all the suggestions you guys have been giving. I'm pretty surprised myself that I'm still not familiar with all this stuff... I mean I have been very passionate about all of this since I started writing music about 6 years ago, but I've just been lacking that small financial push that I really need. Other than the H2n that I managed to get with my income tax check. I've been thinking about starting up a kickstarter and hopefully getting some donations to help us get this started... I just don't like asking for money, you know? I'd prefer to earn it myself, but it's so hard right now. If I could just get enough to have someone help me record a few demos the right way so that people actually have something of good quality to pay for, I'd do that. Anyways... I'm glad there are people in this subreddit who are willing to give me some advice to get started. I'd love to know what you guys think of the song! Good quality or not,  we are especially proud of this one. :) 
p5249
aVI think we gave you advice because it's good enough to hope you get some better recordings and a full line up.  It's not necessarily my cup of tea but it is good in my opinion.  Just needs tightening up.
p5250
aVWell I agree it needs tightening up and like I said,  everything is in rough draft mode right now.  Once we get a bassist and possibly another guitarist,  we'll be able to bounce more ideas off of each other and change some things here and there. The way it sounds in my head is a lot better because I can imagine what the finished product is going to sound like. We're doing the best we can right now considering it's just guitar and drums.

Guthrie's whole approach suddenly made more sense after hearing that.\u000a\u000aI almost never listen to instrumental music any more, but damn if I don't still love Erotic Cakes.
p5268
aVAhh yes, I recall that video. I believe he said he grew up always hearing arpeggios on the sax which produced a much more liquid sound compared to arps on guitar via using a pick. So instead of using a pick he decides to master sweep arpeggio technique with multi-string tapping. So good.  
p5269
aVThis whole album is a masterpiece

aVWhy do you hate it?  I absolutely love this band.  I have yet to pick up a single song from any band and end up listening to their entire discography until I heard All I Know.  This band did that for me and continues to do so. Well Karnivool and Opeth.

p5324
aVWow. I've been listening to quite a few of those bands for some time now, and had no idea they were from 'Straya. 
p5325
aVI just recently started to listen to Caligula's Horse, "The Tide, the Thief and the River's End" might be one of the best albums I've ever listened to. It's been on repeat all week.
p5326
aVSame here. One of my favorites.
p5327
aVGood list but it's a shame they didn't list [Osaka Punch](http://osakapunch.bandcamp.com/).
p5328
aVYeah that is disappointing. I would say it's because they relocated to the UK but Schoenberg are moving to Canada and they're still on the list so...
p5329
aVRecently got into King Parrot and Disentomb. Not prog in the slightest but awesome bands.
p5330
aVHey which of these bands are prog metal? I love Karnivool and I just found Caligula's Horse. They are awesome by the way. I'm sure the other bands are good but I'm trying to expand my musical tastes. I listen a lot to Radiohead, Snarky Puppy, The Reign of Kindo, and Punch Brothers but I'm trying to listen to more prog metal. All the bands I've listen I think are progressive in some way or sort. I just like progress haha. Thanks! 
p5331
aVYou'll like Arcane. Progmetal featuring the vocalist from Caligula's Horse, who have just released a [new double album](http://arcaneaustralia.bandcamp.com/album/known-learned-double-album) this week and its one of the best things I've ever heard. It features the bassist from the band who made the list, [Ne Obliviscaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z9PKxt_9k4), but whilst they are progmetal they are a lot heavier so I'm not sure if you'll like them or not. \u000a\u000a[The Helix Nebula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54LTxhbYbyA) are pretty good as well, technical instrumental stuff. [Closure in Moscow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWzSxg-CjpM) are certainly proggy, but certainly not progmetal, more like progrock. Very fun, funky, Mars Volta-y kinda stuff.
p5332
aVHey thanks! The Ne Obli...(I'm on my phone so I can't see the name of the group) weren't really my thing.  I'll definitely have to listen to more of Arcanes stuff!  The third band (can't remember their name) was pretty cool as well. Kind of reminded me of Animals as Leaders, sort of.  And Closure in Moscow...thank you. They are SICK!!  The vocals slightly remind me of Karnivool's singer Ian.  I'm listening to their most recent album right now. The ending to Pink Lemonade threw me off though haha. It's very groovy.  I like their album a lot so far. 
p5333
aVIts a shame because Ne Obliviscaris are extremely talented musicians. I don't know if you managed to sit through the full 16 minutes of that song but the softer sections are really nice and the guitar and violin solos are insane. \u000a\u000aI'm glad you like Arcane, the most recent release is definitely a step up from their first album, which is good but does fall short in a couple of places. But there is a fucking huge amount of material on the new album so you'll be alright there, most of the 16 tracks are about 8 minutes long, one of them is even 23 minutes long.\u000a\u000aThe third band are The Helix Nebula, I had them pegged as somewhere in the middle of AAL, BTBAM and Scale the Summit stylistically, so yeah I get what you mean. Pretty talented guys.\u000a\u000aNow, with Closure in Moscow you've gotta be a little careful. Their most recent album was their first in like 5 years and it was a pretty distinct change in direction. If you go too far back to their first EP then they're the most infuriatingly cliche emo/post-hardcore band, first full length album is closer to the sound of Pink Lemonade but the post-hardcore influence is still there. I personally don't mind it too much but I'm not sure where your taste lies with post-hardcore, although it is a pretty loose label at the best of times. The new album however is their best work to date most definitely.
p5334
aVYeah I didn't really sit through the song by Ne O...(sorry their name is too difficult for me to remember.) Im just not a huge fan of screaming, though I'm ok with Monuments for some reason.  I'll go back and listen to that song and try to make it through the 16 minutes.  If you can suggest another song of theirs that you prefer, I'll definitely check it out. I listen to metal on occasion.  It's not myy genre of choice.  I really love Karnivool and AAL. They are really the only metal bands I listen to. I like Monuments ok but their songs start to sound the same after awhile, for me at least.  (Not sure if Karnivool is considered metal)\u000a\u000aWith regards to Closure in Moscow, I didn't enjoy their earlier albums.  Haha, you were right.  Pink Lemonade(album) was super refreshing though.  \u000a\u000aIf you have any band suggestions let me know! 
p5335
aVYeah that Ne Obliviscaris song is pretty in your face from the get-go. [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMRKBz89uRQ) might be more to your liking, its my favourite from their last album. A bit more subdued and atmospheric at the start, and the screams are layered with clean vocals over the top so it might be more to your taste. Again, killer guitar and violin solos towards the end.\u000a\u000aYou might like Coheed and Cambria, my favourite band of all time. Their style changes pretty dramatically between albums, and even between individual songs on albums for that matter so finding a song that represents them is difficult. Seeing as we're on the subject of progressive metal, I'll try and show you some of their heavier stuff. I'll give you a few different examples of ones you might like judging by your tastes, but I'll keep it heavy for the time being. Try to listen all the way through each of them if you can:\u000a\u000a[The Willing Well I: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pn3GXm5GKI)\u000a\u000a[In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp_Now6WDRc)\u000a\u000a[No World for Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuqbOCXRY9k)\u000a\u000a[Gravity's Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4zw9qMLKUg)\u000a\u000a[Key Entity Extraction IV: Evagria the Faithful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siUaA8qxbS4) - Not heavy\u000a\u000aLet me know if you want any more songs, or if you're not fond. I can offer other suggestions.
p5336
aVHa it's funny you mention Coheed and Cambria. I love their last two albums. I haven't listened to their earlier stuff though( I have heard Welcome Home). I love pretelethal and The hard sell and number city.  I'll check that Ne O.. Song out!
p5337
aVIf you were to delve into their back catalogue, I'd suggest to steer clear of Year of the Black Rainbow for the time being. Despite having Chris Pennie, the ex-Dillinger Escape Plan drummer, the album itself is a bit lackluster for Coheed. The first 3 albums are generally considered their best work, though they're all pretty good, its only YOTBR that people really have a gripe with.
p5338
aVGood list, but was looking for Divine Ascension. They're a power-prog metal band from Australia and their latest album is pretty kickass.

p5342
asVKamelot - Elizabeth I-III. I don't see Kamelot posted here often, but they definitely have their prog moments, and here's 12 of them.
p5343
(lp5344
VI've said it a million times...The Black Halo is the most perfect album ever made.
p5345
aVRoy Kahn's voice makes me wish I was at least a little bicurious.
p5346
aVAre you bicurious about Conception? If not, you really ought to be!
p5347
aVHa, Kamelot was my introduction to metal, I'll always have a soft spot for these guys. Never thought I would see them here though! The Black Halo and Epica are kinda cool too, given they're 2 different concept albums which retell the same story
p5348
aVI thought the Black Halo was a continuation of the story in Epica (the story of Faust)?
p5349
aVThis is correct, Epica is the first half of the Faust story, and The Black Halo is the conclusion.
p5350
aVIt is, my post is worded very badly! 
p5351
aV*The Black Halo* and *Epica* tell the same story? I did not know that. You learn something new every day.
p5352
aVNot quite. Black Halo is the second half of the story begun by Epica. Together they are a retelling of the story of Faust.
p5353
aVThis is correct, I worded that part of my post quite badly 
p5354
aVAh, I see thank you. I still didn't know this much, just had no idea that the albums were linked in any way.
p5355
aVMemento mori.
p5356
aVI don't know why but I've never seen Kamelot as particularly progressive. Probably due to never really considering it as well as well as the fact that my first exposure to them was definitely more of the power-oriented tracks. First impressions and all that.\u000a\u000aThis shouldn't tell against the fantastic music they create, just that I haven't personally heard it yet (which probably suggests that they are particularly progressive and I'm just daft).
p5357
aVThey aren't particularly progressive, but they have their moments. My favorite is [Memento Mori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnYW1xeixAE).
p5358
aVI definitely hear it now. The progressive moments just eluded me before, probably because A) I'm daft and B) The music was just so good it swept me up for a high I didn't come down from until long after the song was over.\u000a\u000aI'd like to say it was more B than A.
p5359
aVI'd definitely say they are a power metal band over a progressive band too. But often times when I'm listening to them, they'll do something that really surprises me, which to me is one of the cornerstones of progressive music.\u000a\u000aDefinitely mostly power though. 
p5360
aVI think it's just safest to say that bands are much more complex than our seemingly well-defined genres would suggest. Don't pigeonhole them just because it says X/Y genre, especially if they are the calibre of Kamelot.
p5361
aVI don't see Karma or The Fourth Legacy talked about too much but they are up there as my favorite Kamelot albums.  I mean, [this is awesome!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvqxEAtBbFs)
p5362
aVAlright, Kamelot! I'm so stoked to see them in May, with DragonForce as well.

asVI remixed the song Ragnarok by Periphery with stem files I found, what do you guys think of the production?
p5364
(lp5365
VYour mastering is absolutely killing any dynamic range your mix could've had. Periphery mixes aren't the most dynamic but you're is a bit too much

aVsounds too muddy, the guitars are killing your mix i feel. where did you find the stem files?
p5367
aVThis sounds too Meshuggah

asVI'm a freelance drummer who recently successfully crowdfunded my debut solo EP. The first single is free!
p5369

Vlooking good, can't wait for the EP! btw, do you guys have plans to play live locally? 
p5371
aVIts actually my solo project, so in order for that to happen I'd have to get an official band together. For now, my main plan is to use this material for drum clinics
p5372
aVVery cool, congrats on the successful crowd funding. Really like the orchestral intro, been wanting to get the tools to start incorporating that into my sound as well.
p5373
aVI believe I just used Kontact Elements for the intro. Cheap but effective!
p5374
aVThat's what I plan on getting after a midi controller, hate using piano roll. Sounds great!
p5375
aVGreat intro! The rest didn't impress me to much. Maybe because I'm not a fan of that modern guitar sound. Turns me off and I think it's overused in todays progmetal. But what I think is great is that you're a composing drummer. That's how you put the "progress" in Progressive Metal. It's about learning and trying and experimenting. And I always appreciat "Solo"-projects. When there is one person having a master-plan and going through with it. Cheers. 
p5376
aVFair enough. Not being a guitarist myself, its not about the guitar tone for me, but the composition, which is what I spent most of my time on. I left the production to the pros.
p5377
aVWell, got to admit, it's hard for me to judge your compisition with that guitar tone^^\u000aBut for sure I can say, you know what you're doing.

aVDang really? I had the complete opposite reaction! I think they did a good job arranging all the instruments together, especially the violin.
p5398
aVThe violin sounds GREAT! The guitar sounded a lot lower in the mix that that or the drums though. Instrumentation is great, don't think I think they suck! Just maybe different production. \u000a\u000a\u000aI loved the violin haha

p5411
(lp5412
VI guess I'll go first. For me it's far and away [Epiphany by Intervals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipv_l7KoSI).\u000a\u000aOne of the best songs that I have ever heard, and tells an amazing, emotional story without vocals. 
p5413
aVYes yes yes. Me and my bud heard them play that song live before it was ever released, and we were blown away. Picked up the EP after the show and then we learned how to play the song start to finish. Beautiful guitarwork on that track.
p5414
aVI think Inertia is even more emotional than Epiphany (which would be my second pick).

VThis is another great song by Destrage, and it's also an excellent video\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNb2syT6DzM
p5428
aVOne of my favorite songs off of TKiFO.  The beginning is just in your face aggressive metal, and the ending makes me want to bust out my not so sweet dance moves.  Actually, the end *may* be my favorite riff off the album.
p5429
aVNice chorus, but I hate that snare somewhat unreasonably &lt;.&lt; it was st. anger quality bad. And after research, it turns out that it's pretty much like that in every song ._.
p5430
aVNah it doesn't sound nearly as "baseball bat hitting trashcan" sounding, and the way the song is mixed you can't hear the snare nearly as much as St. Anger. That being said, it's not great. 
p5431
aVReally? I think the drums sound great. They aren't over produced and ACTUALLY SOUND LIKE LIVE DRUMS which is something missing from a ton of modern metal. 
p5432
aVPossibly! Maybe 'm just jaded by modern production techniques and so on :)
p5433
aVI understand, what with super clean production becoming more and more popular (largely, imo, because of bands like Periphery and TesseracT). I'm also a huge Destrage fanboy and am possibly biased in that sense :) but yeah, I dig the more raw sound TKiFO offers after listening to so many drum machines haha

sVDeafheaven - The Pecan Tree (2013)
p5443
(lp5444
VI feel like a horrible person for saying this, but I loathe Deafheaven. I've tried to listen to them and I just don't get it. I love post-rock, I adore screaming vocals, but something about that record just irks me. :(
p5445
aVYou don't have to like them, but the reason that I do is just because of all the powerful emotion that Sunbather gives me. Songs like Dream House, the title track, and the latter half of The Pecan Tree. Their music just gives this overwhelming emotion that I haven't been able to experience in other songs before. Their songs give me goosebumps on every listen.\u000a\u000aThen again, I completely understand why anyone wouldn't like them.
p5446
aVI think Sunbather is an incredible album but sometimes I wish I could have an instrumental version of it to show my friends just because the vocals have such a high bar of entry.
p5447
aVSeeing them live really cemented it for me.\u000a\u000aTo each their own, though. 
p5448
aVI can see that happening, maybe it's just something that doesn't really carry through recording. Never going to happen in this dump I have to call home, though.
p5449
aVI saw them live and the whole time I just stood there wondering "Do these guys actually know how to play their instruments or are  they just all attempting to play as fast as possible?" It sounded like a group of people all trying to play a different song on top of each other. I don't see the appeal.\u000a
p5450
aV[deleted]
p5451
aVWhat's the matter? Can't handle a pink album cover?
p5452
aVI'll be the middle(wo)man here. Ever since it's release I've thought this album is really, fantastically ok. It's the epitome of alright. It's not memorable, but it's not bad. It's some black metal and it's some post rock, both of which, to me at least, sound like what I've come to expect from those respective genres, and I can take it or leave the final product that is Sunbather. \u000a\u000aWhat it is is severely overhyped, and *that's* what irks me. I don't get it. 
p5453
aVYeah, I really never understood the critical adoration - and I'm a fan of the album. It kind of seemed like most people writing about it just really wanted to use MBV words like *swirling*, etc, and just be viewed as diverse. \u000a\u000aI think Cult of Luna's *Eternal Kingdom* and *Vertikal* are both superior albums and neither got the kind of love that *Sunbather* did.
p5454
aVOh Cult of Luna are massive. When it comes to mixing in post elements into metal CoL definitely take the cake for me. Their melodies and pacing and layering speak to me more, but I also just enjoy a doomier more brooding and sludgy sound in general so that could be part of the why haha. 
p5455
aVI'm really only learning how far CoL's influence spreads well after the fact. \u000a\u000aI live in Nashville, TN, and from the moment I picked up *Somewhere Along The Highway* until today, I can probably count the number of people who know who they are on both hands - and I introduced them to half that number. I've consistently been one of only two to order their output from my local music store. Which is a bummer.
p5456
aVWhen they play this song live it is absolutely insane. So many emotions in the last half of the song, easily some of my favorite lyrics and just moments in music.
p5457
aVThis band really does split the metal community as a whole. A lot of people, like myself, enjoy the record for what it is, while others might loathe it for a variety of reasons. \u000a\u000aWhat I don't understand is why so many people are quick to call it garbage. Yes Pitchfork did get a whole bunch of hipsters on the hype train for this album, but the fact that an album like this is so universally hated for that reason is ludicrous. 
p5458
aVI almost want to blame George Clarke for that. He works his ass off on stage, sure, but he's the only black metal / post equivalent to David Lee Roth Rockstar emotes I've ever seen.
p5459
aVHis stage presence was hilarious. It was like watching a depressed Michael Jackson front a black metal band. And I don't know if he writes the lyrics but they can be pretty bad at times

aVThe guitar sound is pretty thin, which could be improved with EQ, but I'd try to use a different amp or DI to your computer with an amp/cab simulator. I'd also try using a drum VST rather than an electric kit's built-in sound, although those can be expensive.

aVI think it's fine to post side projects of metal musicians, if only in the interest of helping people find good music.\u000a\u000aThere are several progressive metal bands that have members doing side projects that aren't necessarily metal.

VTo be really honest. It peaked before the genre had really taken off. 
p5494
aVhttp://www.lefthandedtoons.com/toons/drew_bassbear.gif
p5495
aVI feel like the 011000110000011000 stuff is getting old, but I think it has given a great gift to the scene in that more interesting time signatures and rhythms are more widely accepted. I'm sure the djent won't die out for a long time, as we see more "mainstream" bands like Nothing More carrying that influence into a more general light, but the types of bands we most commonly discuss here are going to move onward from it. Just my opinion.
p5496
aVI agree. The elements of it are quite fun. But like Bulb/Periphery did help inspire a generation of bedroom guitarists to learn poly rhythms and syncopation through his own work and his love for Meshuggah. Subgenres of subgenres can only last so long, you're definitely right, but I kind of hope history whittles it down to the gems. i.e no Northlane or anything.\u000a\u000aEdit: grammamamer
p5497
aVLower tuned guitars. 
p5498
aVWouldn't it be awesome if Djent got as big as Dubstep did? Seeing Djent breakdowns in the middle of Britney songs.  I mean, I would hate everything it stood for, but it would still be hilarious.\u000a\u000aThe popularity of genres is not what is interesting about music.  Where music is most interesting is at the fringes of genres, that's where the interesting stuff happens.  Djent is a genre born at the fringe between Progressive metal and Industrial metal.  It'll happen again some place else.  Progressive rhythms on mid-rangey guitars isn't going to disappear - it's where you can take that stuff that matters.
p5499
aVMeshuggah was doing this before anyone, and they exposed people to 'djent' long before Periphery.  \u000a\u000aIt was at it best before all these derivative 'djent' bands formed. 
p5500
aVNot saying they invented Djent, but they were the reason the sound got mass-produced, and record labels found bands that played with Djent-sound as well.
p5501
aVNo one was doing djent before '98 so they did invent it.
p5502
aVI meant Periphery.
p5503
aVoh lol
p5504
aVI wouldn't be surprised if more electronic elements get implemented and we come full circle back to nu-metal. \u000a\u000aAs far as the future is concerned, it's all a matter of what Meshuggah does. Everything djent related begins and ends with the band that ultimately started it. Everyone else is playing catch-up to that sound. \u000a\u000aPeriphery has the "pop" sound down to a tee, but aren't necessarily pioneers of the genre, Bulb aside.
p5505
aVThat's kinda funny, I've been thinking lately how a lot of djent is not unlike nu-metal in presentation. Ultimately it's just another gimmick-based metal sub-genre that seems to follow the novelty-mainstream success-backlash-disownment formula as we have seen before with nu-metal and metalcore (and its many derivatives). You could even argue that's what happened to glam rock and grunge in the 80s and 90s respectively, but the music culture has changed a lot since then.\u000aYou have to progress or be swallowed whole once the collapse comes.
p5506
aVI see that one can think that, that is what I meant. I'm not saying they are the pioners of the genre but they are the reason lots of record labels started to mass-produce these bands. IMO Periphery is the most popular band with the "Djent" mark on them. They've grown bigger than Meshuggah but they have a unstable fanbase, as fans of Meshuggah will be there 'til the end.
p5507
aVI don't know where you get this information from. Meshuggah are a much bigger band. I've watched them headline a festival and seen them with Periphery as support. 
p5508
aVWell, mostly its off hits on official music videos and plays on for example itunes, spotify etc.
p5509
aVMeshuggah have about 15 years extra worth of album sales. 
p5510
aVYes, but they are not known for the Djent. And I'm not saying they are worse than Periphery, I like Meshuggah more. But when it comes to the popular Djent-type scene right now, they are less popular. 
p5511
aVI'd completely disagree. They are the beginning and end to the genre. 
p5512
aVSo you think that their sound is what defines the Djent-hype?
p5513
aVWell, between them and siKth. Yeah.
p5514
aVBut... Neither Meshuggah or SiKth are catchy. How can they lead the pop-djent when they make good music well thought out music instead of catchy tunes?
p5515
aVWhat are you on about? 
p5516
aVI think your on the down side of the genre. It feels a bit like Deathcore in 2009. It was good for a good while but then you grew tired of the sound because it got stale. Then in 2010/11 a fuck ton of new bands released music that took off into the stratosphere and started djent as a genre. The only difference between then and now is that the core bands of djent never really embraced the label to begin with. I don't think Misha ever intended to call Periphery a "djent" band. Same with Tesseract and the Contortionist. That's why they latched onto progressive metal as a genre. They've left it for greener pastures and everybody else is stuck making 0000 000 00 0 000000000 on a 8 string drop f geetar. I'm not saying it all sucks. There's a clear divide between the best, the good, and the shit with djent more than most genres. 
p5517
aVOnce everything gets too poppy then people will rebel against that sound and we will have grunge djent.
p5518
aVand then Post-Grunge-Djent! Nickelback but with 8-strings **cringe**

aVDjent has no future
p5520
aVVildhjarta's "thall" sound is the next step in djent I think. Personally not a fan of djent 95% of the time, only Vildhjarta and Meshuggah really use it well (Periphery have a couple of tracks that use it properly such as The Walk).
p5521
aVYou think so? I like Vildhjarta but I can't see that the general metal scene will appreciate this sound. For me it's more of a heavy niche-sound for those who wants to go deeper. 
p5522
aVThere are certainly great artists making music that incorporates a lot djent elements and a few that will continue to do so.\u000a\u000aBut the demographic is growing up.\u000a
p5523
aVdjent is to metal as dubstep is to electronica. It started off cool when other countries were doing it for years before it reached the U.S. and then the U.S. fucked it up by making it more accessible, then dumbing it down, then over producing it, now there is a new djent metal band every fucking day- just like dubstep producers. \u000a\u000anot prog metal

p5540
aVlitigation? is there a lawsuit going on?
p5541
aVThere is. Although they've kept most of the details out of the public eye. Essentially what is happening is this:\u000a\u000aAfter the contract fiasco with Zoo regarding the number of albums and merchandise rights (circa 1998-2000; we can thank these lawsuits for the delayed Lateralus and the release of Salival as a means to settle what they were obligated to do), Tool took out an insurance policy to try to prevent and protect themselves in the future. With the suit that the 10,000 Days designer and manager brought against the band - demanding to be paid as an equal with the other four - the *Insurance company* they hired to shield them from something like this **is also suing them**.\u000a\u000aI'll have to find the source, but Adam Jones admitted that this has not only delayed this "future album" we've heard about for years, but that it also may prevent them from ever being able to record and release as Tool at all.\u000a\u000aIt's an incredibly convoluted clusterfuck, and really sad that the main roadblock to them returning are greedy, capitalist opportunists.\u000a\u000aEdit: Someone linked Adam speaking about it briefly above.

p5557
aVAnd the high and long note shortly after that... Spencer really nailed the vocals on Juggernaut in my opinion.
p5558
aVSpencer wrecked the vocals, it's insane. It legit makes me angry when people say he's terrible or he got worse since P1 cause he's done nothing but improve tremendously, lol. You don't have to like his vocals, but to say he's bad is just straight wrong. 
p5559
aVHere's my opinion, I think Spencer has an amazing voice, one of the best I've ever heard. It's his *singing* that can really piss me off sometimes, perhaps irrationally, but this is all subjective.\u000a\u000aHis cleans on Omega (the song) and Stranger Things are great because he doesn't add that annoying flair to the singing like he does on much of Alpha (the album).\u000a\u000aHis harsh vocals are right up there with my favorites, and I really respect how he can whip out like six or seven different screams, growls, what have you.
p5560
aVYeah, I can see where you're coming from with not liking his "flairiness", or what have you. It's a bit much for this genre of music at times, but it usually doesn't bother me that much. In either case though and you seem to agree, his cleans aren't inherently *bad* by any means.
p5561
aVI've never been a Spencer fan tbh but he's winning me over with this stuff. By far his best work.
p5562
aV[deleted]
p5563
aVI thought he's improved drastically so far. Although, I think his style is pretty poppy I absolutely think he's a terrific vocalist. The hate he gets is nature warranted for that reason, but I do not think it takes away from his vocals. It's his nature and I think he's awesome. 
p5564
aVExactly this, yeah. The guy has some serious talent and creativity with his voice, from plain menacing shouts, and cleans that seem to turn harsh for a single word throughout the lyric.\u000aThe only thing I don't like is the occasional nasally quality his voice takes in some songs, most noticeably in Heavy Heart.
p5565
aVI find it just downright ignorant to say he's a bad vocalist. People on MetalSucks say this all the time and I just think "how in the actual fuck can you objectively say something like that?" 
p5566
aVHad a guy on Facebook tell me he thought MK Ultra was a bad song because he had a couple of really shallow reasons to not like Spencer's vocals/vocals are bad. I was like. Dude. Come on. 
p5567
aVYeah that sums up MetalSucks.net commenters. What it boils down to is basically just "that's like, your opinion man." You can not like the guy's style of vocals, you can even not like the band. But to say that there's a member in Periphery who isn't talented is just plain ignorance. Those people make my blood boil.

aVWhile it's status as metal may be up for debate, it is certainly not progressive.

aVAgreed, while it's my favourite Ghost song, it's far from prog.
p5681
aVVividly detail what makes it not progressive please. 
p5682
aVsince their whole 'thing' is to sound like a band from the 70s isn't the opposite of progression?
p5683
aVProgressive rock flourished in the 70's. How the hell do you not know that?
p5684
aVThis isn't a progressive rock subreddit, how the hell do you not know that?
p5685
aV"A place to discuss music and anything else related to progressive metal."\u000a\u000aProgressive rock relates to progressive metal, bro.\u000a\u000aI've posted artists like Anathema and Steven Wilson and there's barely anyone who has an issue with it.
p5686
aVFirst bud, slow your roll.  People even in this elitist of a community, they like the song. 29 uprons is rather high for this subreddit.  A few things will mark the signs of prog music.\u000a\u000aTonally: Odd, novel, expermental, or unique sounds for a given instrument. \u000a\u000aVirtuosity: In prog rock and especially progmetal Olympian skill level and racing for new limits is key.  It's not necessary, but a machine like execution is required.   There's Braindrill at one end of the spectrum and Cloudkicker at the other.\u000a\u000aMelody and Rhythm:  In this you should hear a wider palate of note selection and arrangement.   Longer and more complex phrasing.  \u000a\u000aSong structuring:  From the likes of Opeth and Ne Obliviscaris there isn't a formulaic pop structure.  Each song has it's own life and mood linked to the song structure.  There's also the stylings of BTBM who do a zillon riffs off usually one progresson.  Basically each song will not follow some kind of rigid verse chorus verse chorus format.        \u000a\u000a\u000aWhile Ghost is a awesome band they're not progressive at all.  They sound like Blue Oyster Cult which is a painfully dated sound.  It's a nice novelty that they have merged that sound with Satanism, but that has nothing to do with musical merit.   They have very simple song structures, melodic voicing and rhythmic style.   The songs are not uniquely arranged.  They employ a very sparse note selection.     Rhythmic phrasing is minimal and has a pop sensibility riding hard on 1234, even on their few song with different time signatures they still ride the down beat on quarter notes. Which bands like Meshuggah and Periphery do as well. They just treat it much differently.    Is ghost tool in this area? No. Even a goofy band like protest the hero is light years ahead of ghost in the rhythm department. \u000a\u000aWith all of that said IMO that's what makes Ghost enjoyable.   If you're eating nothing but stake and lobster some times a greasy hamburger is nice.  
p5687
aVI disagree that complexity and musical virtuosity is essential for music to be progressive. It's certainly common, but I think unusual song structures and musical creativity is much more of a prog staple. Granted, my definition of prog is much wider than for a lot of people (for example I think most Queen albums are pretty progressive).
p5688
aVI'm in the same boat as /u/helgihermadur here. I believe the creativity behind this particular song makes it progressive. It starts out dark and wonderfully creepy and crescendos into this bizarre surf rock tune. And it's a bit lengthy, which sets it apart from most other pop-y songs that don't exceed four minutes. I know length's not everything in progressive music, but I don't think that's a detractor here.\u000a\u000aRegardless, I'm sure this will get downvoted into oblivion like everything else I've posted on this particular thread because it fits outside of what a lot of you believe what is and isn't progressive. I don't mean to come off as pretentious with this next statement, but I like to believe I know what progressive music sounds like, seeing as I grew up on artists like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Jethro Tull and other great prog artists of the 70's.
p5689
aVPeople like you are ruining this subreddit.\u000a\u000aI love Ghost, but they aren't even prog. \u000a\u000a* 4/4\u000a* Non-virtuosic musicianship\u000a* Nothing experimental\u000a* No complexity/technicality.\u000a\u000aGet the fuck to /r/progrock or just /r/rock.

aVOne of my most impressive achievements as a human being was finally being able to hand drum this entire album without error.  Graduating college?  Getting a career job?  Getting promoted at such a young age?  All pale in comparison to this musical achievement.  \u000a\u000aBut yeah, the breakdown you mention was one of the last ones I conquered.  It was like the final boss of the album.  I basically just had this album playing in my car non-stop for like 3 months.  
p5697
aVdat riddum doe
p5698
aVDamn I can only kinda play Ragnarok, though I have made it through the first 5 tracks of Tesseract's Altered State
p5699
aVAltered State is another great one.  Periphery 2 and Altered State are two of my all time favorites for sure. 
p5700
aVYea Periphery 2, didn't start off as a strong one for me but really grew. Do me a favour and check out the new monuments album - amanuensis and give it atleast 4 - 5 listens. \u000aIn about 2 weeks you will be crying at how good the song saga city is...  
p5701
aVRgnarok - can't get enough of it.. Congrats on nailing Tesseract! I got concealing the faith, but Altered state will take a lot more listens. That Sax solo though...mmmm
p5702
aVIt's all about thinking about how Misha likes to put together patterns. He likes to do stuff alternating between 1 note, 2 note and 3 note patterns. You have to view it as a series of short patterns put together. Kind of hard to explain but it took me a long time to get that rhythm until I viewed it in that way and then it just clicked into place.\u000a\u000aIf "*" is palm mutes and the numbers are notes, it goes something like:\u000a\u000a1 \u005c*1 \u005c*\u005c*123 \u005c*\u005c*1 \u005c*\u005c*12 \u005c*\u005c*1 \u005c*\u005c*123\u000a\u000aSo you just have to ignore the palm muted notes and concentrate on the down strokes, which go in patterns of 1-3-1-2. Then he likes to throw in little grace notes to invert the pattern, but you just have memorize where those are.\u000a
p5703
aVThat's serious respect points.  I'll keep at it.
p5704
aVThe amount of "doe's" and "dat's" in Periphery comments almost makes me hate myself for having them be my favorite band...\u000a\u000aEither way this is my least favorite song on the album, really thick and cool sounding **though** since they used 9's, but the only part **that** I like about it is the segue into Scarlet.  \u000a\u000aTop 3 Favorite albums of all time **though**.

aVDream Theater is a pretty obvious choice. Scale the Summit is a good instrumental band. Modern Day Babylon is another solid one. Anathema isn't metal, but their new stuff is all clean vocals and they're amazing. Animals as Leaders, too, even though someone already mentioned them. I just have to reiterate how amazing they are. If you like Protest the Hero, I would recommend Destrage, but they do have a pretty good mix between screaming and clean vocals. Other than that, I think that's a pretty decent list.

aV+1 for Haken. The Mountain album is really, really good all the way through.
p5804
aVSuch an amazing album. Cockroach King? Fuck me.
p5805
aVHaken are definitely metal. They definitely put more emphasis on melody and song structure rather than sounding heavy, but songs like The Cockroach King and Pareidolia are definite headbangers.

aV"Similar to Thank You Scientist" is a hard order to fill. But if offbeat prog is what you're looking for, try out VOLA. And while they're not exactly prog, Diablo Swing Orchestra is probably as close to Thank You Scientist as you can get.
p5823
aVHmmh... Thank You Scientist are really unique. The closest I can come up with now is Coheed And Cambria, Karnivool, Porcupine Tree and maybe Tool if you want to stretch it that far.

aVSoen, Devin Townsend Project, Riverside, Rishloo.

aVDTP is the act that actually made me stop hating growled vocals because he does it so well.
p5831
aVDTP has a great mix of some solid metal with a handful of really fun pop-y songs.  Like on the Z2 album you've got War Princess as a metal song and Sky Blue as an almost pop song.  \u000a\u000aI love that album.  
p5832
aVHave you tried TesseracT, Skyharbor, or The Safety Fire?

aVI fucking love Tesseract. But I'll definitely add Skyharbor and Safety Fire to my playlist! thanks man!
p5834
aVSeconding The Safety Fire, cant ever get enough of them
p5835
aVI think this comment just changed my life. I love finding new bands. Thanx
p5836
aVSkyharbor's first album is mostly singing with some screaming, but their second album has no screaming whatsoever.  It's less metal instrumentally as well, and goes more into hard rock territory.  Not a bad thing, but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as "metal" (personal opinion). TesseracT is same singer as skyharbor before he left the band for skyharbor.  They are more heavy on the screaming, but "April" specifically by them is a brilliant song.
p5837
aVAltered State from Tesseract doesn't have any screaming, IIRC
p5838
aVProtest the Hero is the obvious choice\u000a\u000aProbably scurrilous because it is entirely clean vocals\u000a
p5839
aVI love the album Volition! and i'll check that other band out thanks!
p5840
aVOh, scurrilous is Protest the Hero's album before Volition. But check out the band Mandroid Echostar. I can pretty well guarantee you will like them!

aVTides of Man and Circa Survive are good ones if you're going in the Mandroid Echostar direction. Give Dreamhouse (ToM) a shot

aVSymphony X
p5843
aVCorelia. Thank You Scientist. Closure in Moscow. Polyphia(instrumental). \u000a\u000aYou'll love em. 
p5844
aVAs someone who usually isn't a big fan of screams/growls, Corelia is amazing.
p5845
aVDefinitely check out Seventh Wonder. Their singer has a really powerful voice. 
p5846
aVPlus he fronts Kamelot now.
p5847
aVTheir mix of complex instrumental arrangements and compelling and straightforward vocals are superbly executed. 
p5848
aVIndeed. There are always two melodies going on at the same time with Seventh Wonder. A super catchy vocal melody on top of a complex mix of guitar and bass. \u000aAlley Cat is a great example of this. 
p5849
aVLook for the instrumental version of the Ocean albums: [Heliocentral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iky3BU2nJOQ), Anthropocentral and [Pelagial (full album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L7YSrQmVDw)

aV[**Pomegranate Tiger*** - *Entities*](https://pomegranatetiger.bandcamp.com/album/entities-2)\u000a\u000aThis guy may not know how to spell, but he knows what's up with good music. Please do yourself a favor.

aVwww.circuitry.bandcamp.com
p5861
aVSurprised no one has mentioned Pain of Salvation yet. Try the album The Perfect Element. 
p5862
aVTPE and Remedy Lane are the best
p5863
aVOP you NEED to listen to these albums.  Gildenlöw may be the best metal vocalist I've ever heard, not to mention his virtuosic guitar skills.   The man is a genius. 
p5864
aVHe really does have a tremendous range in his voice yea. But I'm also admittedly a giant fucking PoS fanboy and my first (and currently only tattoo) is a PoS one so I'm a tad biased.
p5865
aVI just discovered Nothing More. While not super proggy, they have their moments and fantastic choruses.
p5866
aVThey put on one hell of a live show
p5867
aVI just saw them recently, fucking brilliant 
p5868
aVHow recently? I saw them last night and there's a chance we might have been at the same show. Which would be pretty cool. 
p5869
aVNa I live in Canada, saw them last Friday.

p5873
aV&gt; Epica\u000a\u000aMore symphonic than progressive, but they're one of my favorite bands so +1 for Epica
p5874
aVI'll add [**Plini**](https://plini.bandcamp.com/album/other-things) and [**Wanzwa**](http://music.wanzwa.com/album/wanzwa-iii) to your list of vocal-less albums.\u000a\u000aBoth of them are super cool; Wanzwa is weird, psychedelic, trippy prog rock that just doesn't give a fuck about limits or boundaries or what's acceptable. It's too weird for some, but I've loved every album. Plus the dude who does it, [**Marty Eason**](https://soundcloud.com/marty-eason) is a beast and does other things too.\u000a\u000aPlini is wayyyyy more chill. Mostly focused on guitar, he shreds up something bad, but totally has his songwriting DOWN. He's a great dude too always [doing things for charity](https://plini.bandcamp.com/track/ko-ki) and what not. Real down to earth type. His trilogy of albums will be complete in March and I recommend grabbing a [pre-order](http://plini.bigcartel.com/).\u000a\u000a\u000aLastly, I'll mention [**In Via**](https://frames.bandcamp.com/album/in-via). They are a bit more prog-*rocky* but the way they write will give you visions if you close your eyes and listen. I was high, but only on the tunes. 
p5875
aVOh wow, I've never seen anyone mention Wanzwa here! That first album is *out there,* it's fantastic. A ton of weird, awesome songs.  \u000a  \u000aAlso, Plini- Absolutely phenomenal, SUCH good song writing! With that said, everyone also needs to hear his original project, [Halcyon](https://halcyonofficial.bandcamp.com/). This is some of my most favorite music that has come out in the past five years alongside CHON and a few others. So sick.
p5876
aVYes. I remember listening to Halcyon back when!\u000a\u000aAnd I'm stoked for CHON's new album. I'm getting that lunchbox!
p5877
aVYou may enjoy [Intervals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZay7xCZ-Uo) . 
p5878
aVAWESOME! thanks!
p5879
aVUnfortunately Intervals' front man is no longer with them but if they get a new one hopefully he will be similar. 
p5880
aVIndeed!
p5881
aVLoooooove that band.
p5882
aVA band no one listed yet: 3\u000a\u000aBecause of the name they're really difficult to search for, but combinations of "3 band" on YouTube should find their stuff. I had never heard of them at all before Prog Nation '08 and they ducking blew me away live, and most unfamiliar bands can't do that for me even with a studio album let alone a live performance.\u000a\u000aThe End Is Begun its an awesome album.
p5883
aVI first read your first sentence as "A band no one listed yet :3" you know, with the :3 emote at the end.
p5884
aVSoen
p5885
aVLast Chance to Reason, try albums level 2 or level 3. There is a hint of harsh, but 95% clean. Level 2 is incredible.\u000a\u000aEdit: Ok, maybe 75% clean...
p5886
aVI like Psychotic Waltz. Also, try listening to Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime concept album. Brilliant piece of work.\u000a\u000aEdit: Quuensryche-&gt;Queensryche
p5887
aV[**Tetrafusion** - *Horizons EP*](https://tetrafusion.bandcamp.com/album/horizons-ep)\u000a\u000aI'm literally jizzing in my pants just thinking about this again. I also got into **Disperse** around the same time I found these guys, so I will second/third/fourth/whatever that motion. 
p5888
aVPlus the *Horizons EP* is a concept album, and I don't know about you, but I love those so much.\u000aListening again, I almost feel like it could have been the inspiration for **Interstellar**, the movie. 
p5889
aV[The Safety Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0bv6zvUSPc) are perfect for you. They have a very unique style of songwriting with influences from Meshuggah, Periphery, Protest The Hero, Dillinger Escape Plan, Sikth, with a beautiful haunting voice, with occasional yelling or shouting.\u000a\u000aProtest The Hero, Dillinger, Sikth are also highly recommended. \u000a\u000a
p5890
aVHas anyone mentioned Cynic, yet? Lots of vocoder vocals though. 
p5891
aVGoddamn Cynic is awesome. I'm so glad they're active again, only having Focus for so long was a bummer.
p5892
aVFor ridicolously awesome instrumental prog metal, check out [Angel Vivaldi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6EyfClK6to)!
p5893
aVI strongly suggest you to *try* and like harsh vocals. I was in your position a while ago so I know how it feels to love a band's instrumental but be unable to listen to it because of the vocals.\u000a\u000aFortunately I found some bands that I just could NOT not listen to and after a while I ended up enjoying the vocals. Now I bloody love harsh vocals, not all of it, of course, but things like [Adrian's lows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJhq7k5K5Zo) are just so damn good.\u000a[Within The Ruins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-F_r9z5ZiM) and [Eluveitie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iijKLHCQw5o), as I like to say, Stockholm Syndrome'd me into liking harsh vocals and I'm thankful to them for that.\u000a\u000aSo as a opinion from someone that was were you are, try to like it. Listen to BTBAM more, find another band you love the instrumentals and keep listening to it, you might eventually like the demon voices :P\u000a\u000a===========\u000a\u000aBut aaaaanyway, on-topic, give [Wings Denied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZYbFY9XkZU) a try, they're pretty damn good and the vocalist shows up in the sub sometimes, really nice guy [and he's an amazing vocalist too].\u000a\u000aOh, and thank you Firefox for crashing and making me type all this again, love you.
p5894
aVYeah I mean I love my fair share of harsh vocals. I love Meshuggah, revocation, and other bands with harsh vocals. I guess I need more Clean vocal songs in my library since I seem to enjoy them more hahaha

aVUsually not a big fan of death metal harsh vocals, but I don't listen to a lot of that, so can't really have much of an opinion. Which bands do you think excel at it?
p5898
aV[deleted]
p5899
aV[Atoma](http://atomaweb.com/) - progressive space metal with clean vocals. \u000a\u000aAnything by Arjen Anthony Lucassen: [Star One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx6ic6iRPHM), or [Ayreon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZlizuZE3Mk)\u000a\u000aThere's also a lot of bands without any vocals, if that's what you're into.
p5900
aVHeadpsace, Haken, Spock's Beard, and Porcupine Tree! 
p5901
aVOne I'd recommend that I don't see is Blind Guardian. They just released a new album, and boy is it great!
p5902
aVModern Day Babylon is an awesome instrumental one man djent project.
p5903
aVYes, can confirm is awesome and instrumental, [but there are 3 of them now](http://youtu.be/XWSFGQjN6Ow)
p5904
aVI imagine it has to be for the purpose of live performance. They'd be an absolute spectacle to see live.
p5905
aVSome Jazzy Prog metal check out 'Thank You Scientists'. 
p5906
aVA bit late, so I just put some I couldn't ctrl+f here.\u000aTried to stick with clean vocals and metal\u000a\u000a* [Tomorrow's Eve](http://youtu.be/k28horc4G8I) - oldy, very similar to dream theater\u000a* [Myrath](http://youtu.be/o1g62x7qybA) - stumbled upon them recently, reminds of warrior within\u000a* [Circles](http://youtu.be/R0Ly2xTJY1g) - a lot like tesseract, I think\u000a* [Chaos Divine](http://youtu.be/W2ncqcCOioA)  \u000a* [Anubis Gate](http://youtu.be/pARREzvOYb4)
p5907
aVBeardfish, Porcupine Tree, Darkwater, Ayreon, 22, Shadow Gallery, Cynic, Chimp Spanner, Communic, Disperse, Walking Across Jupiter, Being... 
p5908
aVJust because I haven't seen them mentioned: [Fair to Midland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhFJvIZfB_s)\u000a\u000aThey do some growling, but even then it isn't too jarring.
p5909
aVFates Warning, Queensryche, OSI
p5910
aVMandroid Echostar
p5911
aVHaken! They are fantastic 
p5912
aVMy friend Raymond is the drummer! Great to see them getting recognition. :) (He is a total boss on the drums and a lovely bloke)\u000a\u000aIt's been pretty crazy seeing Portnoy namedropping them and him jamming with Rudess etc. Whirlwind.
p5913
aVoooh, and how about OSI (Office of Strategic Influence). Not really metal per se, but has metal influence, with Steven Wilson influence as well.
p5914
aVI'll definetly check them out! Thanks!
p5915
aVOSI is made up of Dream Theater's original keyboardist and the guitarist from Fates Warning, and features drums from Mike Portnoy and Gavin Harrison (best modern drummer out there). 
p5916
aVThere's The Safety Fire that is pretty much like Protest the Hero.
p5917
aVLeprous - Forced Entry: http://youtu.be/GxAIsZldltA\u000a\u000alisten. ...
p5918
aVI'm right there with you. Most growly vocals ruin it for me. I'm ok with some of its done tastefully and mixed with clean. Some of my favorites are Dream Theater, Devin Townsend, Ayreon, Ne Obliviscaris, Protest the Hero, some Opeth. \u000a\u000aHave you tried much power metal? Some of that stuff has a similar vibe to prog with lots of good Bruce Dickinson style singing: Blind Guardian, Sabaton, Iced Earth, Stratovarius. 
p5919
aVProg Metal similar to BTBAM, without vocals:\u000a\u000a- Modern Day Babylon\u000a- Wide Eyes\u000a- Walking Across Jupiter\u000a- (some of) Animals as Leaders\u000a\u000aThe best Prog without vocals:\u000a\u000a- [All those above, especially AaL]\u000a- CHON (like AaL but very upbeat and happy tone to it, chill)\u000a- Plini (ambient, incredibly chill, like Cloudkicker and Tycho had a baby)\u000a- Sithu Aye (very similar to Plini, slightly more heavy)\u000a- Cloudkicker (varies quite a bit, can be heavy, can be very chill and minimalistic)\u000a- Polyphia (flashy, party djent)\u000a\u000aThe best Prog Metal/Rock with clean vocals:\u000a\u000a- Twelve Foot Ninja (everything; reggae, funk, rock, metal, dubstep bits, awesome vocals mostly clean, one of a kind, just awesome)\u000a- The Contortionist (specifically Language- xtra proggy, beautiful, mostly clean vocals)\u000a- TesseracT (one of a kind, been mentioned, Altered State is magnificent)\u000a- Uneven Structure (some harsh vocals, atmospheric, great cleans)\u000a- Tool (hovers between Rock and Metal, Prog nonetheless, all clean)\u000a- Dead Letter Circus (similar to Karnivool, more like Prog Alt Rock)\u000a- DispersE (been mentioned, brilliant, fantasy-style)\u000a- Rishloo (similar to Tool, very underrated)\u000a- Lesser Key (up and coming, with Paul D'Amour who was in Tool, Rock-ish, a little like Deftones)\u000a- Persefone (quite a bit of harsh vocals, very technical, pretty unique, great few tracks that are instrumental)\u000a- Shokran (mostly harsh vocals but instrumental version of their latest album is available and incredible, technical oriental)\u000a- The Safety Fire (been mentioned, I'd describe as Prog Indie Metal)\u000a- Northlane (bit of a stretch, mostly harsh vocals, but check out Quantum Flux, great lyricism and technical drumwork)
p5920
aVCloud kicker is amazing! I'm still waiting on that new tool album... \u000a\u000aBut thanks for other amazing bands!

aVIt ruins the WHOLE band for you? Come on, man. I mean, I have zero respect for a piece of shit like Chris Brown, but I'll shake the hand of the man who played bass on his tunes. \u261d\ufe0f
p5923
aVif you like Dream Theater:\u000a\u000a[Circus Maximus](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Circus_Maximus/32715)\u000a\u000a[Fates Warning](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Fates_Warning/604)\u000a\u000a[Shadow Gallery](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Shadow_Gallery/1411)\u000a\u000a[Vanden Plas](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Vanden_Plas/1400)
p5924
aVWas going to say SG and CM, beat me to it :)  Add to this list Seventh Wonder, Darkwater, Innosense and Dimension Act.
p5925
aVI actually don't listen to any of those bands, I just got them from the "Similar Artists" tab on Dream Theater's metal-archives page. I'm more of a Thrash/Death metal guy. Dream Theaters is pretty much the only "clean" prog metal I listen to, all the other prog I listen to is Death Metal, haha.
p5926
aVAh man, definitely give SG and CM a listen then... I actually find myself liking then more than DT overall (SG has a tremendous body of work, CM's last album is them really finding their sound). 
p5927
aV[Children of Nova](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=children+of+nova)
p5928
aVOpeth's latest album The Pale Communion is very experimental and contains none of the growls of their earlier stuff (Which I personally still love)
p5929
aVVanden Plas has some magnificent work I think often flies under the radar far too much. Let's see, I'm not sure where to tell you to begin though.\u000a\u000aTheir earlier albums, The God Thing and Beyond Daylight, are great. Both of which have a more melodic and less metal sound.\u000a\u000aSkip Far Off Grace.\u000a\u000aThen there's the latest three: Christ 0, The Seraphic Clockwork, and Chronicles of the Immortals: Netherworld Path 1. All three are story-driven concept albums. And all three are amazing. Christ 0 has a great blend of melodic and metal. Seraphic is probably the heaviest. And Chronicles turns it down a notch to create an amazing atmosphere and ambiance.\u000a\u000aIf you're on the fence about sinking your teeth into a full album, here's a VP starter kit that I think has some decent variety:\u000a\u000a[Christ 0 - January Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztzMII6T-U4)\u000a\u000a[Christ 0 - Fireroses Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RBqBFaUq_Q)\u000a\u000a[The Seraphic Clockwork - Rush of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5iaORePhao)\u000a\u000a[Beyond Daylight - Scarlet Flower Fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXOE_5WWRLE)\u000a\u000a[The God Thing - Rainmaker (couldn't find the studio version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd5AQxNXu28)\u000a\u000aLet me know what you think! Cheers!
p5930
aVRecent Opeth albums are prog with clean vocals
p5931
aVThere are tons of prog metal bands with clean vocals or no vocals at all.\u000a\u000a- Dream Theater  \u000a- Symphony X  \u000a- Animals as Leader (no vocals)  \u000a- Porcupine Tree (later albums - earlier stuff is more on the rock spectrum, but still great)  \u000a- Tool  \u000a- Areyon (and other things involving Arjen Anthony Lucassen)  \u000a- Devin Townsend's later stuff is a very mixed bag - there's lots you'll enjoy  \u000a- Haken  \u000a- Protest the Hero's later stuff is mostly clean  \u000a- Opeth's more recent albums, to the chagrin of most metalheads  \u000a- Liquid Tension Experiment  (no vocals)  \u000a\u000aEnter any of the above into a service like Spotify and start a radio station or navigate to "similar"/"related" artists and enjoy the rabbit hole.
p5932
aVTesseracTs album Altered State
p5933
aVObviously depends on how heavy you want it while also being clean, but scrolling through I haven't seen anyone mention these yet:\u000a\u000a**Gazpacho** - akin to *Anathema*, perhaps, but less epic in scale, not very heavy.\u000a\u000a**Quidam** - they're not active any more, but check them out, fairly lightweight as well.\u000a\u000a**Redemption** - this one is more metal than the other two, *Snowfall on Judgement Day* is one of my favourite progmetal albums.\u000a\u000a**Riverside** - they've been mentioned, but deserved reiteration, great emotional prog, possibly more rock than metal but still fairly raw and heavy at times.\u000a\u000a**Synaesthesia** - Almost psychedelic at times.\u000a\u000a**Kingcrow** - More in the same vein as *Anathema*\u000a\u000a**Nevermore** - wanders between prog metal and power metal, worth checking out.\u000a\u000aAlso check out stuff where *Devin Townsend* is involved, potentially *Neal Morse* as well if you like the more synth based melodies, although you seem like the more guitar-heavy type. My taste might be too light for you altogether, but sharing anyway.\u000a\u000aOh and some of the heavy stuff I listen to - **Ne Obliviscaris** could be worth a listen, they do have quite a lot of growling sometimes but there's also clean vocals and longer expanses of instrumental. Another one is **The Ocean**, they have both instrumental and vocal versions of most of their music.
p5934
aVI'd be weird if you hand't heard about Steven Wilson just yet. If you didn't, make yourself a favor and do it right now!
p5935
aVPain of Salvation, Spock's Beard, Enchant.

aVTesseract.
p5938
aVLeprous is cool.  If you like Townsend and Haken you should like them.  
p5939
aVI'd like to reiterate how incredibly good Karnivool's "Sound Awake" is.  Also, Asymmetry is their third major label release and contains minimal screaming (as in, two sections in just a couple of songs) and is an interesting concept album.  Start with Sound Awake though if you check them out.  \u000a\u000aI wouldn't say The Contortionist is without growling vocals, but the song "Language I" off their most recent album, Language, is brilliant and contains clean singing.  I would look up that song specifically.  \u000a\u000aOpeth has been mentioned before, but their catalog is huge and may be hard to sort through for someone not familiar with them.  Damnation was a very quiet and introspective album they did which is dark, but not traditional metal.  It's non-metal from a metal band.  Watershed was their last effort that could be classified as anything near traditional metal.  It does contain some growling, but it's mixed in with a lot of clean singing and non-metal instrumental sections that make it worth checking out.  Heritage was a complete departure for them, and is more in line with 70s acid prog like King Crimson.  Those three specifically from Opeth are all great albums and drastically different offerings.
p5940
aVIf you like Periphery but don't like the vocals you will almost certainly like these guys:\u000a\u000a[Bleeding Skies](http://entrosolet.bandcamp.com/music)\u000a\u000a[This is Life](http://thisislifemusic.bandcamp.com/album/atlantic-imagery-2011)\u000a\u000a[David Maxim Micic](http://davidmaximmicic.bandcamp.com/)
p5941
aVSomeone should totally make a spotify playlist...
p5942
aVNot enough mentions for Ayreon and everything else Arjen Anthony Lucassen does. His latest solo album, while not really metal, is amazing. His lyrics are often cheesy, but that's nothing too out of the ordinary in the prog-rock/metal world.\u000a\u000aAlso like others have mentioned, if you haven't checked out Devin Townsend's stuff, you definitely should. Especially all his Devin Townsend Project albums.
p5943
aVDream Theater.  Amazing band with completely clean vocals.  Symphony X is a melodic semi prog band with clean vocals as well.
p5944
aVI grew up with Dream Theater since for some reason some dumbass put them as "iron maiden" in limewire. But yeah I love DT
p5945
aVAh yes, the limewire genre stuff.  I remember that very non fondly.
p5946
aVI see Babylon and Atoma mentioned here so need to throw in another Middle Eastern reference. How about Israel's finest, Orphaned Land?\u000a\u000aAlso, how about Deadsoul Tribe? Very low-key under-recognized band with some metal influence and a little Jethro Tull flute sprinkled in to get your prog juices flowing.
p5947
aVI know a lot of people have mentioned them, but I''ll reiterate. You need to check out Cynic if you haven't already. They've been doing this since '93 and each of their albums feels completely unique. If you don't like one, you're bound to like another. They're one of the kings of the genre, in my opinion.
p5948
aVHow about Klone? French prog metal band. Throw in a saxophone every now and then. They get pretty heavy sometimes with some harsh vocals but never really reaches that "death metal" kind of harshness.
p5949
aVI'm not sure how "prog metal" they are, but I love Polyphia's new album "Muse."  On mobile so I can't link, but they're an instrumental band that focuses on guitar. James Franco and Champagne are two of my favorite songs if you want to give hem a listen.
p5950
aVAlso, check out Evergrey. They're not super proggy but they got that proggy concept album thing going on. Only clean vocals. And if you haven't listened to Katatonia...sheesh. They're in my top 10 for sure. Last 4-5 albums...whoa!
p5951
aVOpeth has one "clean" album Damnation that's pretty good.
p5952
aVSeventh Wonder!
p5953
aV Can't believe I haven't seen it yet. Chimp Spanner is definitely worth checking out. Instrumental and not too heavy, but definitely metal.

aVI can't recommend Ayreon, or anything made by Arjen Anthony Lucassen, enough! Like you, I really enjoy progressive metal without growling vocals. Growling ruins the music for me, since what I most enjoy is the amazing melodies you can find in the progressive genre.\u000a\u000aIf I should recommend a specific album, I would pick [Ayreon - The Theory of Everything](http://youtu.be/TQFmfZCcrYw). This is an amazing concept album, which tells a continuing story about a genius who can't express himself. The story itself brought me to tears (I should say, I am easily moved by music, but this one is special), and the music never ceases to amaze me. It's sad I will probably never get to hear this album live, because of the many different artists involved, but it is really worth picking up and listen to.

A bit harsh but the overall song is very clean). Later I discovered Intervals, Volumes and Sithu Aye. I don't think anybody has mentioned Sithu Aye yet, he's a one man spacey prog outfit who shreds incredibly hard and most of his material is available on his bandcamp for free sithuayemusic.bandcamp.com , my personal favorites are Invent the Universe and Pulse

asVAdvice for someone struggling with composition?
p5970
(lp5971
VHey dude! As somebody who has written a concept album, a concept EP, and is nearly done a second concept album, I might be able to offer some good advice. Melodic or rhythmic themes with variations on harmony and instrumentation that can  be repeated throughout is a very useful tool. Subtle repetition is what makes concept albums memorable. Don't be afraid to do some weird things with harmony at the end of a song to make sure that it flows into the key of the next one. Using synth pads or ambient guitar tones is helpful for getting certain songs to flow into one another. Good luck, man!
p5972
aVAs somebody who has written a concept trilogy, four other concept albums, three more non-concept albums, and is currently working on a tenth album that contains one concept epic, I agree with this guy and will also try to throw some other advice at you. \u000a\u000a* Unless you're specifically going for the "this album is really one song broken into movements" approach, don't feel obligated to force smooth transitions. There's nothing wrong with letting a song finish and starting another one somewhere else if it feels better. \u000a* I tend to do a lot of my music writing away from any instruments \u2013 on notebooks in school or at work, or on the back of church bulletins. I recognize my limitations as a guitarist, so I know I have to sometimes come up with ideas with my mind rather than my fingers.\u000a* Listen to music that's outside your typical fare. Classical, jazz, and old prog rock are awesome for getting the juices flowing. \u000a* With my first concept album, I wrote all the lyrics first, and improvised the entire album just being influenced by them. (I miss being able to do that...) So maybe just record yourself improvising while reading your lyrics, and listen back to see if you came up with any riffs or sections you really like. \u000a\u000aHope some of this helps. Looking forward to hearing your album!
p5973
aVInteresting. I guess now that I think of it, lots of my favorite concept albums don't necessarily have smooth transitions between movements. That was a goal of mine but you're right, I don't think its something that needs to be forced. I wish I was on the level where I could write music away from my instruments. One thing I am able to do, however, is whistle out ideas for melodies/riffs. I have about 1000 recordings on my iPhone of spontaneous ideas that pop into my head! I should get into the practice of physically writing on a notebook though.\u000a\u000aFor me, classical, jazz, and old prog are part of my typical fare. I do, however, think I would benefit from listening to some pop, electronic, alternative stuff. Thanks for the ideas dude!
p5974
aVThank you! I think I just need a little more patience and need to stop being hard on myself. I agree with you about subtle repetition, but I seem to struggle with the "subtle" part, haha. Appreciate your advice man
p5975
aVDo you mean piecing a song together from the riffs or making your songs flow from one another?
p5976
aVI guess I meant piecing a song together from riffs. I have lots of riffs, and I could transpose them to make them all in a key that works together, but they still never "feel" like they belong together. Its like I'm forcing them together for the sake of making a song. I need a new approach.
p5977
aVI'm currently working on my own concept album with a comic series so I usually try and use visuals or what is literally happening to create a song. For example, I have a song where the main character is pacing back and forth in his apartment so I wrote a riff that runs up four notes and back down. That gets repeated throughout my verses as the character voices is monologue in the lyrics. \u000a\u000aI find that writing riffs beforehand without a clear intention makes it really difficult to combine them. I know that the riff is good but if that piece can't smoothly transition into the next, then I'll end up hating the rest of the song no matter how good the next riffs are. 
p5978
aVThere's not really a secret to doing this, but transitions really are everything. I think it's a good idea to listen to the bands you like to see how they do it and try to imitate that until you find your own original way of doing it. Different bands have different approaches and it'd be a good idea to play around with different ideas to find one that works for you. I suggest listening to bands who use extended Song forms a lot such as Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, and Dream Theater. Pay close to attention to how these bands move from section to section. They all have a distinct way of doing it. Try implementing these ideas into your own writing to help piece together your ideas. \u000a\u000aDream Theater in particular is a good one to listen to because Mike Portnoy's role in the band was to do exactly this and it shows in the band's last two albums. While the music is fine, if you pay attention to the structures of the music you'll notice a lot of jarring transitions and a bit of a struggle to piece together songs. It's not as smooth as in the past. Study the transitions found in I&amp;W and compare those to the ones in ADTOE. Not only will this highlight the importance of arrangement, but it will also give you some good ideas hopefully.\u000a\u000aHope this helps! 
p5979
aVThanks for the input. You've kind of made me have an epiphany, as well. I couldn't quite figure out why the new DT albums sort of sucked, but I think you hit the nail on the head. It was totally about the transitions. It always was. I don't know why I couldn't see that. But you're 100% right
p5980
aVYea, I didn't care for ADTOE much and while I really liked DT12, the major flaw on both of those albums are the transitions.\u000a\u000aCheck out how Opeth does it. Off the top of my head I'd say they're the best at doing this, especially if you're making riff driven music. Every single transition they do is seamless. 
p5981
aVEveryone's compositional approach is different, but I'll share mine.  I'm not formally trained or educated in theory, but I try to use it to some extent.  Otherwise, my music sounds unpleasantly random.\u000a\u000aIf you're like me... I can chug out music that goes together in a key / scalar sense all day.  But it often does not sound good or interesting overall.  The next step is to think about melodic motifs and patterns to build music around.  \u000a\u000aFor example, I usually write rhythmic riffs with some kind of chord progression in mind, even if it's not truly chordal.  Then, when you go to write leads and melodies, think about the key notes of the chords you are basing the rhythm on and try to emphasize those in your playing.  For me, I'll really in a jazz phase so I make heavy use of 3rds and 7ths (often manifested by starting / ending a phrase or applying rhythmic emphasis on these notes).\u000a\u000aIf you're into music theory, read up on voice leading in a jazz context.  A classic example is moving the 7th of one chord to a key position (such as 1st, 3rd, or 5th) of the next chord in the progression.  I believe the standard 2-5-1 progression works this way.\u000a\u000aAnd given that the new Periphery album is really topical, check out some of the [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2thywk/juggernaut_recurring_themes_compilation_video/) analyzing motifs and repetition.  This is a good example of use of motifs in a concept album context.\u000a\u000aFinally, an excellent band you might enjoy that creates great songs from simple melodic motifs is [Special Provicence](http://specialprovidence.bandcamp.com/).  Songs like K2 have a relatively straightforward melodic pattern that they play with and create a whole song around (that I find awesome, at least).  And if you watch them live, they improvise the solos around that pattern, demonstrating true mastery.
p5982
aVFirst of all, thank you for recommending Special Provicence. Holy cow, love that first track (Babel Confusion). So cool. \u000a\u000aI actually just purchased Mark Levine's *The Jazz Theory Book* and I understand it is sort of the golden standard among jazz students. Looking forward to working through that and learning more. I wasn't a music student in college, but I have a basic to intermediate understanding of theory. \u000a\u000aI find that I'll come up with the riff/melody idea first before coming up with a chord progression. I've found that if I come up with a chord progression first, I feel kind of restrained and that I'm obligated to create a melody that works within that progression. I want to break free of that mindset. Thank you for your thoughtful response, I'll definitely continue to learn as much as I can about jazz.\u000a\u000a**EDIT**: I want to include this little quote from the aforementioned book: "A great jazz solo consist of 1% magic, and 99% stuff that is explainable, analyzable, categorizable, and doable. This book is about the 99% stuff."

asV/r/ProgMetal's Album of the Week: Nokturnal Mortum - The Voice of Steel (2009)
p6010
(lp6011
VI came into this skeptical, however, there are some nice proggy elements here that set it apart from the black metal bands, and a somewhat of the musical departure from the metal we hear on this forum sometimes.\u000aThe symphonic aspect is well done and the concept seems fleshed-out.\u000aI enjoy the rawness of the guitars, doesn't sound like a meticulously designed sound profile imitated through an Axe-Fx.\u000a\u000aHowever, subject matter wise, this is quite controversial. \u000a\u000aBTW, who will be picking album of the week? The only way this works is if it rotates or we should make a weekly drawing to see what user would like to select the album, with some obvious rules (i.e. no one band gets back to back weeks, no recent releases that are spamming the front page anyway) \u000a\u000aEdit:\u000aUkraine: Enjoy the Gaelic string intro melody. The guitars are incredible, albeit simple, but the harmonic construction on the record is layered perfectly, and with amazing tone. Soaring melody with nice string harmonic back drop. This is a great track. Def. not something for the purists.\u000a\u000a
p6012
aVThank you for keeping an open mind while checking out this album. The purpose of a good chunk of our AotW choices are to broaden the horizons of our subscribers and challenge their notions of prog metal. \u000a\u000aI have personally already catalogued all of the albums that are to account for a over year's worth of AotWs. Expect to see a fairly eclectic variety that again, will not have any discernible pattern in regards to order (because there isn't one; the list has been randomized by a script). No one band will ever have more than one of their albums featured, at least for the first year we run this. As well, AotW will generally not feature new releases, as that's not its purpose. 
p6013
aVThanks for starting up the album of the week again! I'll be sure to give it a listen when I get home!
p6014
aVNo problem! And update us when you've heard it. 
p6015
aVThis is really, really good. I'm typically not very big on Black Metal, but this was very well done. I could definitely listen to more stuff like this. Is their newest album a similar style?
p6016
aVI like how these guys are trying to add something new to the genre. We've all heard the typical "listen to this trem riff" blackmetal band.\u000a\u000aSidenote; I really wish black metal didn't have such a lo-fi aesthetic attached to it's recording production. It's a shame that a lot of this music can often be overlooked by outsiders simply because the record sounds like an amateur demo. I get the harshness of the sound "adds to the aggression" or whatever but you can be just as aggressive and not sound like a garage band. /endminirant
p6017
aVAs happy as I am that we're getting weekly discussions back, I don't think these guys deserve any attention, since their vocalist is an outspoken racist. Will still give the album a listen though.
p6018
aVIf it's good music, it gets featured. Extrapolitical issues do not affect this.\u000a\u000aHowever, it's probably still worth noting that (in an albeit very vague post), the singer recounted on his views in 2014. https://www.facebook.com/nokturnalmortumofficial/posts/10154629159940487

aVYou're welcome.
p6021
aVNice concept for a black metal band
p6022
aVYes. It's something that black metal purists will reject, but also something that doesn't really have a concrete place in any other music circle. Which is why I love this album so much. 
p6023
aVAnd too think that I don't like the whole genre of black metal as a whole (it's too harsh for my ears) but the fantasy-sque lyrics are good.\u000a\u000aAfter all , most dark/black metal bands sing about Tolkien right?
p6024
aVNope, that would be Satan. 
p6025
aVOh.\u000a\u000aAre there some black metal bands who sing ln a clean voice and sing about non-satan themes?
p6026
aVSorry, yes there are many that are not Satanic, I was just being snarky. Most of the Satanic bands are the Norwegian ones that emerged in the early to mid nineties, and even then many of them were doing it just for show, not out of legitimate belief. \u000a\u000aAs far as clean singing goes, harsh vocals are a requirement for something to be considered black metal, as far as I'm concerned. You'll find some bands that combine harsh and cleans but as far as I'm aware, you'll find none that only have cleans. 
p6027
aVThanks
p6028
aVYou're welcome, Phillip. 
p6029
aVI was only vaguely aware of Nokturnal Mortum, mostly due to their very questionable political leanings (although it seems they somewhat grew out of it). I never actually listened to any of their music before.\u000a\u000aVoice of Steel is an excellent album, no doubt. It reminds me a quite a bit of the more experimental USBM bands like Wolves In The Throne Room, Krallice or Panopticon, perhaps Nachtmystium, but the combination of folk elements and Floydian soundscapes is still very unique.\u000a\u000aFavourite track: White Tower. I just hope it's not a song about white supremacism.\u000a
p6030
aVI've only recently been really getting into black metal ( I crept in through Enslaved's discography in reverse order). I enjoyed this album way more than I was expecting. I'm not as eloquent at describing music or how I react to it as other users but I would love to keep these albums of the week going.\u000a\u000aHow are you guys planning on choosing which album to present?
p6031
aVNice to see you're not going with an obvious pick, I would've never guessed this would ever be an album of the week here. It's not really an album you would really call progressive metal, but I think it certainly is progressive, so it fits, and it's something completely different than the usual music posted here, which is good.\u000a\u000aAnyway, this is a really great, and also a really fun album. I absolutely love the juxtaposition of the thundering rhythm of the guitar and bass guitar, and the more light-hearted keyboards and folk instruments on top of that. And just like with the instruments the switching between harsh and clean vocals works really well too, it keeps the music varied and it keeps me engaged. Whereas lots of black metal is very rhythm-based, and tries to invoke a hypnotic sound, here the folk melodies add a whole new dimension to it, and makes it a lot more accessible and fun to listen to. Whenever I listen to the album I routinely catch myself humming along with the melodies, which hardly ever happens with black metal. I haven't really followed the band since the release of this album, but I do sure hope they're still active (metal-archives says they are), and are making new music, because I'm dying to hear where they go from here.

asVDisillusion - And the Mirror Cracked. Just discovered this band, and I instantly fell in love with this album.
p6095
(lp6096
VYES, I discovered these guys a year or two ago and this album is just so beautiful. It's a real gem. It also satisfies in the melodeath aspect of it too. Listen to the title track of the album if you haven't yet, it's the best.
p6097
aVFor years, they seem to be in the process of writing new stuff. Yet they have to deliver. :(\u000a\u000a"The Porter" EP is soundwise very much alike to BTTTOS. \u000a"Gloria" on the other hand is something different. Though highly recommended.
p6098
aVGood to see someone not just shitting on "Gloria" because it's different.  It's still a solid album, as long as you go into it not expecting BTTOS2.
p6099
aVWhat's BTTTOS?
p6100
aVTechnically it's only 2 T's, but "Back To Times Of Splendor," the album this song is from.
p6101
aVCool, thanks.
p6102
aVthis album fucking kills.
p6103
asVVoivod - Le Pont Noir - [5:43]
p6104
(lp6105
VI wouldn't exactly call Voivod underrated but they could certainly be rated higher. If you have somehow avoided Voivod up to this point, try to give *The Outer Limits* a listen. I consider it a near-perfect album.
p6106
aVThe Outer Limits is easily top 3 Prog Metal album for me, Moonbeam Rider, Jack Luminous, Le Pont Noir, Nile Song, Fix My Heart. Really the only song on there that isn't at least an 8/10 is The Lost Machine, and that's because Snake reminds me a bit too much of the B-52's guy on that one haha, and even then that's only in a few spots, the riffs are still 10/10.
p6107
asVArt By Numbers - New album song sampler
p6108
(lp6109
VI'm so fucking excited for this.  I liked the vocalist before he left, but these demos sound so delicious, I don't even care if they don't find a new one.
p6110
aVSame.  With riffs and compositions as juicy as the ones in that video, they really don't need a frontman. 
p6111
aVHoly shit me hyped. Reticence was so damn good.
p6112
aVSounds a lot like The Human Abstract.

asVDrummer Brandon Burkhalter re-joins Polyphia, replaces Randy Methe
p6116

Vwat
p6118
aVThey bribed him with that new kit he wanted...\u000a\u000a\u000aSeriously though I really don't enjoy most of Polyphia's material but Brandon is an excellent drummer. He should join a tech/prog death metal band imo unless Polyphia stop with the 4/4 backing track songs.\u000aThat being said I'm optimistic for their next release.
p6119
aVVideo message: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNyx_pFc-PE\u000a\u000aOfficial statement:\u000a\u000a&gt; Hey guys, we have a big update for you. We want to let everyone know that we have respectively parted ways with drummer Randy Methe. We are still good friends and wish him the very best. With that being said, we are very pleased to announce that Brandon Burkhalter has rejoined the band. You can expect lots of awesome things to come. Read his statement here:\u000a\u000a&gt; &gt; Hey folks!\u000a\u000a&gt; &gt; Brandon here...\u000a\u000a&gt; &gt; I just wanted to take a moment to warmly greet all of you after being gone for the period of time that I was. I'm sure there may have been some irresolute feelings and and a few unanswered questions regarding my departure from the band last year, but for everyone who supported Polyphia and me individually in spite of that, I deeply thank you, and assure you to know that all of your love and support did not go unnoticed. Alongside all of the soul searching, and everything I had the privilege to experience in my time away, one of the biggest things that got me through it all and brought me back home was the love and support from all of you out there who believe in us and what we do, and for that, I am very grateful and excited to reciprocate that gratitude to all of you with the music we will make from here, forward.\u000a&gt; &gt; It feels good to be back. I've certainly missed all of you and the rest of the guys, and can't wait to see your smiling faces on tour! :)\u000a\u000a&gt; &gt; Seeing you soon,\u000a\u000a&gt; &gt; Brandon    
p6120
aVGood, Randy was pretty sloppy. 
p6121
aVI kind of feel bad for him though. Gets a spot in an upcoming band of excellent musicians and potentially great songwriters but he wasn't able to write with them at all...
p6122
aVThank god. Hopefully they go back to their debut sound with this.
p6123
aVBrandon was the drummer on Muse
p6124
aVYeah I know, just liked the debut better :)

sVWhat is your least favourite song by your favourite band? Why?
p6130
(lp6131
VPeriphery - The Parade of Ashes\u000a\u000a\u000aIts just... So... NOT Periphery. I know Clear is an experimental EP though, so its alright.
p6132
aVI find it strange that my favourite song from that project was actually The Parade Of Ashes. Would probably have made a great Mothership song (if Spencer goes back to that, which I hope he does, he could always include it live), and I loved The Mothership's demos. Still, can see why people would dislike it.
p6133
aVAgreed. That song is ass. Sorry, Spencer.
p6134
aVPowerman 5000 anyone?
p6135
aVThis is why it's one of my favorite 'Riff'ry songs!  So much PMan5k just oozing out of everywhere!
p6136
aVMeanwhile that's my favorite song of theirs... But I'm also not huge into Periphery.\u000a\u000aI still can't differentiate any of their songs from each other and I've been listening to them for 2 years. ^(don't kill me)
p6137
aVThat's exactly how I feel. You're not alone. That said, I don't like their vocalist and their songs all sound the same.
p6138
aVI keep trying to listen to them but their vocalist puts me off every time I gotta be honest
p6139
aVHe sounds too angsty, like he should be singing for an emo/[crabcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDzt6yI3Dw8) band. I can get a similar (better) sound from TesseracT and Daniel Tompkins is back! 
p6140
aVI felt the same way about a lot of their songs but after really listening I loved it.  
p6141
aVAgreed. It's so dance-pop, and Spencer's vocals are abnormally grating.
p6142
aVPersonally, mine would be [Sky Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRFHR19EW34) by The Devin Townsend Project. It's just a bit too pop for my tastes, which is strange because I loved Epicloud and the rest of Sky Blue. I know Devin cited Usher as an influence for this song, and not being a fan of Usher, probably explains it a bit. It's also just a bit too basic in it's structure and pretty unexciting musically. I still like it (I'm actually listening to it as I write this, I feel so two faced), but it's probably the least interest I've had in a song by the DTP.
p6143
aVSimilar for me, expect instead of Sky Blue it's Ih-Ah.
p6144
aVFunnily enough, Ih-Ah is one of my favourite sentimental songs ever.
p6145
aVDude, Ih-Ah makes me cry.
p6146
aVSky Blue is weird for me, because I've never been a fan of basic pop rock, but this just got really emotional for me. Maybe it's the lyrics or Anneke's glorious voice and that part before the last chorus. I just love it. 
p6147
aVSame musician, but my song is War. I have never liked it, and I really dislike that Dev's made it a live staple. If I'm watching a Dev show, that's the song I skip over.
p6148
aVI love War. Just the whole swing time thing that I'm a sucker for I guess. It's also pretty relateable for me, I've struggled with sleep problems before (not in years) but the lyrics of that song describe pretty much how I felt most nights.\u000a\u000aI think War's a cool song, personally :)
p6149
aVWhoa, not the song I'd expect to see in the Devin response of this thread.  War is just about up there with Funeral, Earth Day and Triumph for me.
p6150
aVSame....
p6151
aVFirst time I've heard this song, have to say I absolutely love it
p6152
aVThe fuck bro. That's the best song on that album.
p6153
aVMy favourite is Rejoice. The verse hits so hard.
p6154
aVShowing my age, but Epic by Faith No More. It really shows nothing about their songwriting and intensity, but was the single with so much airplay. 
p6155
aVMike Patton sounds quite nasally in that song to me. Not sure if it was intentional or not knowing him, but I didn't really dig it.
p6156
aVI read somewhere (and cannot find a source of it) that they originally wrote this with Mosley in mind, but Patton got hired and wrote the lyrics. \u000a\u000aI dunno, I kind of like Mr Mosley; Patton is by far the better singer and my appreciation for them both doesn't detract from the other. \u000a\u000aI should see what that guy's up to now. 
p6157
aVChuck Mosley is not in a good place from what I last read, unfortunately.
p6158
aVThat's a bummer. I just listened to his new (2012) album and I kind of like it.
p6159
aVToo bad , love Mike Patton but he was part of the band like all the guys
p6160
aVIt varies, but right now it's probably Tongue-Splitter by Protest. \u000a\u000aEdit: I read wrong. This is my favorite song right now. God damn it. \u000a\u000aLeast favorite is probably A Life Embossed. 
p6161
aVBut that song kicks ass lol
p6162
aVEvery Protest song kicks ass.
p6163
aVTake my upvote
p6164
aVIt does. I'm an idiot and read the title wrong. 
p6165
aVThat song kicks ass too! 
p6166
aVA Life Embossed? The badass song about Pitbulls? I don't understand :(
p6167
aVI don't not like it. It's a great song, but it's definitely my least listened to. 
p6168
aVThe first half of that song is straight fire! I really like it, but it's definitely front-heavy in terms of the momentum.
p6169
aVI actually prefer the latter half, it's emotional and quite fun to sing.
p6170
aVFor me, it would have to be Tilting Against Windmills. Rody's lyrics were obviously never on par with Arif's but he really displays he lack of intelligence and awareness in that song.
p6171
aVHow so?\u000a\u000aAnd, my least favorite song on Volition has to be A Life Embossed. I still consider it a good song, it's just, it's the heaviest and most dramatic song on the album, and you think it's about this huge thing, what with the vivid language and Holocaust references, when it's just about... the pitbull terrier ban in Toronto.
p6172
aVDidn't Rody write the lyrics to Hair Trigger? I think those are my favourite PtH lyrics. Full of clever puns and metaphors.
p6173
aVHe did.  The only lyrics Arif wrote on Scurrilous were C'est La Vie, Moonlight and Sex tapes. 
p6174
aVCoincidentally my first, second, and sixth favorite songs on that album.
p6175
aVI thought that Tandem had some really great lyrics, and I actually assumed Arif wrote them.
p6176
aVYea I'd love to hear how that displays a lack of intelligence.
p6177
aVMaybe you just displayed yours.
p6178
aVDream Theater, all the ballads.
p6179
aVWither starts out so strong, and by the chorus the song just falls completely flat. 
p6180
aVAnother Day? Does that count as a ballad?
p6181
aVOk, I give Another Day a pass. That song is awesome.
p6182
aVYou dont like through her eyes? 
p6183
aVWhile I agree with /u/helgihermadur, I like Through Her Eyes only in the context of the album. It's a very pivotal song and can be very emotional if you are invested in the album's characters; but on its own, the song is not all that great.
p6184
aVNot really.
p6185
aVOh my god I thought I was the only one.
p6186
aVProtest the Hero is my favourite band and I can't be bothered to listen to a single song off A Calculated Use of Sound. That album may not count though so I guess it'd be Nautical off Kezia. I get the style makes sense for the song is just too jarring to the flow of the album for me and I just tend to skip it. 
p6187
aVNautical has been among my favorite songs ever since the first time I heard it.
p6188
aVWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR CHILDREN
p6189
aVCalculated Use Of Sound is pretty decent. Obviously take it for what it is - an early EP, but some of those songs are pretty cool. Worth a listen IMO.
p6190
aVI agree it's worth a listen,  I know plenty of people that really like the album, it just isn't for me. Too much punk sound going on and Rody's singing is laughable to me on that album. 
p6191
aVRody has come a loooooong way since ACUoS. The whole band has lol.
p6192
aVLooking at Luke's big solo moment in These Colours Don't Run is actually crazy to think that once, that was the epitome of his skill level. Now, he's a guitar god with awesome technical stuff in pretty much every song.
p6193
aVDefinitely. His voice has matured since then and the bands technical skill has shot through the roof. 
p6194
aVWasn't calculated when they were really young? Not saying that's an excuse to like it or anything, because you did say it may not count. But I couldn't have done something like that at that age.
p6195
aVYeah,  they were extremely young. They were still young when they put out Kezia. And I agree,  I couldn't have done something like that at that age or my current age. They've always been talented dudes. 
p6196
aVExtremely so. My friend would trash talk PtH all day and say they ended riffs in the same scale. Maybe he was just jealous haha
p6197
aVWell yeah they were just kids.. of course it sucks. Tons of great bands have shitty first albums that they were able to bury away somewhere. But the mere fact that they were able to write a complete album at such a young age is still quite impressive.  
p6198
aVDream Theater - Along for the Ride, because of the recycled keyboard tone from the Beneath the Surface solo. To me it makes the entire track feel like a re-hash.
p6199
aVDream Theater has really missed on a lot of their recent "ballads" like Far From Heaven, Beneath the Surface, and the aforementioned Along for the Ride.  Dream Theater has had some great ballads, like The Silent Man, Hollow Years, Through her Eyes, and especially Wait for Sleep, but the recent ones feel so boring and flat.\u000a\u000aStill, I feel the worst Dream Theater songs are You Not Me and Build Me Up, Break Me Down.  Both have some decent moments, but should be in their wheelhouse and they miss terribly.
p6200
aV&gt;Dream Theater has really missed on a lot of their recent "ballads" like Far From Heaven, Beneath the Surface, and the aforementioned Along for the Ride. \u000a\u000aBig fan of all of these! As DT ballads go I'd say the only ones I'm not bothered about are Wither, The Answer Lies Within and Through Her Eyes
p6201
aVLike most of Falling Into Infinity, You Not Me really suffered when the record label interfered, just listen to the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiifJfOg_mI).
p6202
aVThe self titled album is so disappointing.  Not including their debut (which is still intriguing being their first) it's their worst by far.  Overall it's so uninspired.
p6203
aVI absolutely loved ADTOE, it was my favourite DT album, surpassed only by Scenes From A Memory. I had such high hopes for the self titled :(
p6204
aVI really dig ADTOE too, so I completely get where you're coming from.
p6205
aVI really don't like Sun of Nothing, off BTBAM's Colors. It works with the rest of the album (I really can't imagine the album being any other way), but the song by itself really lacks a lot of the BTBAM sound. To me, it's a filler between Ants of the Sky and Informal Gluttony. Like I said, it's necessary to the concept of the album, and I appreciate its sound juxtaposed with the rest of the album, but I'd never go to that song first and press play.
p6206
aV\u266b I'm floating towards the Sun.... \u266b 
p6207
aV[deleted]
p6208
aVA spaceman, that's what they say I am.
p6209
aVI strongly disagree, but upvoted cuz I can't stand when people downvote for opinions. Come on guys. 
p6210
aVYeah really. Downvotes are for people who are being asshats. If you disagree with an opinion, voice your disagreement in a reply and do or dont upvote
p6211
aVWhy do people care so much about being downvoted? I don't get it
p6212
aVI feel the same way about Informal Gluttony, like it's a decent song but I'd never choose to listen to it over any of the rest of the songs on the record
p6213
aVI actually start the album at "Sun of Nothing" quite frequently for this reason.
p6214
aVI usually go Prequel to the Sequel and then loop back to the begining after White Walls
p6215
aVMan, I just can't deal with anything off of Colors or TGM being anyone's least favorite. I'd have to go with...Laser Speed off of Alaska. I don't listen to Alaska very much, but I hardly ever listen Laser Speed
p6216
aVLaser Speed is way too heavy for me. It really kills the more technical, artistic vibe of BTBAM.\u000a\u000a*/s*
p6217
aVRespect your opinion but damn dude, this is probably my favourite BTBAM song. Such a journey, from the savage riffs at the start (some of their most aggressive post Alaska) to Tommy's piano and singing...with a huge climax too. My favourite would have to be the harmonised guitar leads around the middle...I'M MY OWN PLANEEEEET. 
p6218
aVMy favourite band shifts, was BTBAM for a long time, recently it's Protest The Hero, and even more recently Periphery (Juggernaut!)\u000a\u000aI'll go with Jetpacks Was Yes! by Periphery. Compared to every other song on their Self Titled it seems just too simple and slow. The song is just the basic strumming with the high notes played at the same time for most of it. Not a huge deal since the rest of that album; their discography kicks ass, but none the less it's not a great track.
p6219
aVYou just named three of my top five favorite bands of all time. Add in Coheed and Cambria as the number one, and Monuments as number five and you're me. 
p6220
aVYeah, when I first heard about them, 5 or 6 years ago, that song was the first thing that popped up on YouTube. I was really unimpressed and didn't listen to them for a long time after I heard it.
p6221
aVDude(tte), Jetpacks Was Yes! is an awesome song! It's certainly not as driving as most other songs, or exciting, but the lyrics are awesome, and it's still well-written instrumentally. I'd say the weakest song off the self-titled is Letter Experiment; kinda boring after a bit and not too varied.\u000a\u000aAs for worst Periphery song, though, it's either Parade of Ashes or Alpha IMO. Too poppy, instrumentally kinda boring, and generally not enjoyable in terms of vocals.\u000a\u000aJust my thoughts; I respect your opinion though.
p6222
aVProtest the Hero\u000a\u000aLeast favorite: The Reign of Unending Terror (I like all of their songs, just like this one the least right now)\u000a\u000aFavorite Right Now: Tongue-Splitter\u000a\u000aFavorite All Time: The Dissentience or Sequoia Throne
p6223
aVProtest the Hero - Tilting Against Windmills\u000aIt's just one of those things that conflicts with me. I get the criticisms the band has of the church and of religion, I just don't like to be bombarded with it in my music. At least not so directly, because Kezia was rife with the symbolism and criticism, but I loved the whole thing
p6224
aVYeah, heavy handed praise lyrics from Christian bands can really affect my ability to enjoy a song. By the same token, heavy handed lyrics by anti-religious bands can have the same effect.
p6225
aVIndeed. Even as a man of faith, heavy-handed praise gets old. I don't indentify with church music. Mouth of the South handles it well with brutal honesty about life being not that great. the bible never promises good times just because you have Jesus. Just gives you a reason to live. end rant
p6226
aVBecause It's There, by Haken. It's just too much pitch correcting and eletronic drums for me. I don't hate it, it's just my least favorite song.
p6227
aVAwww, man! The bass solo though! I really like it in the context of it being the calm before the storm that is Falling Back to Earth! I see what you mean though, but I personally think it shows one of the more unique qualities of Haken with the a capella section and what not!
p6228
aVProbably 'In The Flame of Error' by Coheed &amp; Cambria.  There are only a few songs of YotBR that I actually like.
p6229
aVDefinitely their weakest album
p6230
aVAgreed. Was so disappointed, but you can't really beat their first 4
p6231
aVThe Afterman was no disappointment either
p6232
aVI love that track. It reminds me so much of Cuts Marked in the March of Men. My least favorite track is definitely The Black Rainbow.
p6233
aVI feel like that's the only track that works with the shitty production on the album
p6234
aVPeople have disagreed with me on this before, but I say "Far" is the one that works best with the production. Those drums man...
p6235
aVChris Pennie's drumming doe.... Guns of Summer is probably the craziest (instrumental-wise) song Coheed has ever written. Too many people don't give YotBR the respect it deserves. Totally the weakest Coheed release by far, but not a total shit-fest like some people make it out to be ^_^
p6236
aVPorcupine Tree - Lazarus\u000a\u000aIt's just way too slow and singer-songwriter for me.
p6237
aVQuite possibly my favourite ballad....
p6238
aVIt definitely is polarizing depending on one's other taste in music. I love it.
p6239
aV[deleted]
p6240
aVI'm a drummer and a huge Tool fan and I can only think that Danny oversimplified his drums for the chorus in H. It's too "high school" sounding for me.
p6241
aVAlthough I can appreciate most of Fair to Midland's earlier efforts despite the lower quality of production and different style, I've never been able to get myself to finish "See, Saw" off of Carbon Copy Silver Lining. It's only seven minutes (you know you listen to prog when those words find themselves strung together), but the way it's written and put together just makes it feel like it's dragging on for far too long.
p6242
aVProbably Rikki Tikki Tavi by Fair To Midland. It just feels less finished and less complex than the rest of their work.
p6243
aV\u266b If you meet the Devil's wife, make sure you wear a suit and tie and leave him where he staaahaha-hahahands \u266b \u000a
p6244
aVaw man, I absolutely adore that song. The bear voice speaks to me there.\u000a\u000a...\u000a\u000a...\u000a\u000aIma go listen to it.
p6245
aVAw man, I love that song. Feels super dynamic, and the growled verses get me riled up.\u000a\u000aAs I said in an earlier post, I think some of the CCSL era stuff pales a little in comparison to their earlier stuff, though given the position they were in, I can see why.
p6246
aVDestrage - [Tip of the Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnNmmxmmHF0)\u000a\u000aThis whole album is fun, aggressive, in-your-face metal until this song.  It's kind of a ballad, but not really?  It really doesn't work with the rest of the album imo, even if it's meant as some sort of interlude.
p6247
aVAnything off Opeth or Katatonias first 2 records. I just hate old school death metal like that. Funny because Still Life is my favorite Opeth album
p6248
aVThe only thing I can complain about with Orchid and Morningrise is that the songs don't really flow like later Opeth at all, and just seem to be about 10 ideas put together. I like the music, just wish it worked better as a whole.\u000a\u000a
p6249
aVI kinda wish Opeth would rerecord Under a Weeping Moon.  That song starts off so pretty.  But the quality just sounds so archaic.  
p6250
aVThis is such a refreshing post! Everyone goes on about their favourite songs from these awesome bands, and we hardly seem to highlight where our beloved bands are at fault.\u000a\u000aHaving said that, Fossil Genera by BTBAM never really struck a chord with me. I typically appreciate the goofier side of the band, but the circus-y theme just doesn't do it for me. [This part](http://youtu.be/_XX4aXkjwTo?t=7m36s) sums up my distaste. What also bugs me about the song is the fact that they've played it probably 4 out of the 6 times i've seen them, when they could've used up 12 precious minutes of their set to play something I would enjoy more :'( 
p6251
aVThe Contortionist-Oscillator.  
p6252
aVMan, that song is so heavy it could rip a hole in spacetime.
p6253
aVOh my god, the contrast between the intro and the interlude gives me chills every time
p6254
aVwhy do you hate it?
p6255

aVI had to go down my list of favorite bands to find a song I didn't like. I stopped at Modern Day Babylon. Travelers is an amazing record. That last song before the vocal versions completely kill the end for me. Thaller Than Thall is everything wrong with djent as a genre. It's a bunch of chugs over an uninspired poly rhythm drum beat with some ambience and scales with a clean spacey type tone. It's soooooo slooooooow! Ughhhhhhhh, boring! I will skip that song 95% of the time. 
p6259
aVDream Evil, being the flawless group of evildoers they are, do not have a bad song to their name. With that being said, not a huge fan of Kill, Burn, Be Evil.
p6260
aVPain of Salvation - Break Darling Break 
p6261
aV5 Deep On Charlie by The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza. If your a fan, more than likely you'll disagree with me since it has been regarded as their trademark song but I just can't get into it. I think it's just taste. And yes, I do like their older stuff before Josh was in the band.
p6262
aVFavorite band: Opeth. \u000a\u000aLeast favorite song: The Funeral Portrait. \u000a\u000aThing is, that's not technically my least favorite song by them. If I were to be objective about it I'd probably name something off of Heritage, maybe Slither. But subjectively Blackwater Park is an impeccable work of art and a triumph of originality and there's just something a bit bland and unnecessarily repetitive to me about that song and i feel it ever so slightly interrupts the masterful flow of BWP which saddens me a bit every time I listen to that album from front to back, and because if that I'm dubbing it my least favorite. 
p6263
aVBlack Rose Immortal - Opeth, i just don't feel it.
p6264
aVA Sight to Behold by Gojira. Hate the intro. Otherwise, I really love everything else.\u000a\u000aA close second to Gojira is Mastodon, and for them, I'd say that I truly hate anything off The Hunter except Stargasm. Fuck Curl of the Burl especially.
p6265
aVProbably Milk Lizard by Dillinger.\u000a\u000aDillinger are my favorite ever since I've first heard Option Paralysis in the beginning of 2013.\u000a\u000aMilk Lizard was the first song I've heard from them back in 2010. At the time I was listening to a lot of witless metalcore/deathcore like emmure, asking alexandria, blabla... I was 15 years old. A slightly older friend suggested dillinger, so I've watched the first music video that was suggested on youtube.\u000a\u000aMy expectations were high and the music was completely different, than what I expected. So I hated the song and thought the band sucked...\u000a\u000aNowadays I really like Milk Lizard. Especially the chorus. But I still like most songs more. I just have this weird relationship with the song.
p6266
aVMilk Lizard was my starting place, as well as the other more "normal" Dillinger songs too. I probably couldn't have gotten into them if it weren't for those, but nowadays it's their hectic shit that I love most. Noone quite like them.
p6267
aVI love the songs the most, where they manage to paint this contrastful picture of beauty and dread like in farewell mona lisa, baby's first coffin or paranoia shields. Greg does a wonderful job with his beautiful voice and aggressive shouting. Great thing is, that they've had this dynamic songwriting forever and the insane contrast ever since greg joined.
p6268
aVAutodidact by Between the Buried and Me. It just feels like less thought and creativity went into the riffs.
p6269
aVThat's one of my favorite btbam songs :'(
p6270
aVWhat? What about all those crazy bass and piano parts at the end? That song has plenty of awesome riffs
p6271
aVFor me it would probably be one of those random songs on their first album.
p6272
aVAt the very least it beats Laser Speed. There's nothing speedy about that closer to Alaska.
p6273
aVNo way that's my favorite pre - colors song.... I hate you :( 
p6274
aVDisease, Injury, Madness by BTBAM. The only sour note off an otherwise utterly flawless album. I can't explain it, the song rubs me the wrong way. The first half is annoying and I can't ever get into the song. I wonder if making a personal cut of the song and listening to the album through would give me a feeling of completion, or if I'd just be vandalizing art because I don't understand it? 
p6275
aVHaha dude don't think too deeply into that. Art is what you want to make of it. I like that song but it's definitely one of the more bland songs they've out out since colors
p6276
aVI think that's the best song on TGM, the worst one being Swim To The Moon, which is still and amazing track, I just think the middle of the song drags on too long.
p6277
aVThat album is really great, but I do have to agree with you on the dragged out bit. But otherwise, the lyrics, music, and all else are incredible.

p6285
aVWe'll be getting more stuff recorded and online very soon! I used my Schecter Hellraiser through my line 6 floor pod plus through a 100w combo for the guitar, our bassist went direct through his boss multi fx to my focusrite scarlett 2i2, and my drummer used 2 mics (one was an sm57 for the snare/cymbals...

p6314
aVHonestly metal vocals often sound really funny by themselves but once you layer the vocals and add music it's night and day.

aVSounds poopy IMO\u000a

aVPT have some crazy good B-sides. Most other bands would kill for a song like [Buying New Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpAkF4g11PE), which is one of my favourites songs ever, and they just put it on the Recordings compilation like it was nothing.
p6327
aVNormal is another B-Side which is one of their best songs. 
p6328
aVCompletely agree. I heard the story on that one was it was recorded but wouldn't fit the tone of the album they were working in (Lightbulb sun?).

p6336
aVIt's all a continuous story, though, so starting with Alpha would probably be a good idea regardless.
p6337
aVI've heard an awful lot of people say that they gave up listening a few songs into alpha because "poppy bullshit and not metal".  I'm just trying to prevent that. \u000a\u000aEdit: although how the fuck anyone could hear MK Ultra and whine about "pop" is beyond me
p6338
aVI completely agree. I think anyone who would complain that the new Periphery is "pop" must be blisfully unaware of the current state of pop music...

aVThis is good. My preorder hasn't even shipped yet..

aVI did Killer Merch and got my download last night. I ordered the ERRA EP last time and other than slightly high shipping costs its probably the only site that hasn't left me in the dark.
p6346
aVI'll have to remember that for future pre-orders.\u000a\u000aYeah I haven't even gotten an email specifying when I should expect shipment. All I got was an email confirming my order.
p6347
aVYeah. Just to consider, I've really only seen Sumerian label stuff on it.
p6348
aVDamn, I preordered through them on the 15th and got it a week later
p6349
aVThanks. Time to update my Spotify playlist. 
p6350
aVUp on the UK one too. 
p6351
aVWhat the fuck? It's listed under two separate artists called Periphery, and the album covers are slightly different... 
p6352
aVYeah, I saw that too. I was aware of the other Periphery but Spotify decided to add Juggenaut under them as well...
p6353
aVBoth albums are marked as 2014 as well. \u000a\u000aNot that big of a deal. It will get worked out eventually. 
p6354
aVI have bought both albums. I'm curious what people here think about them.\u000a\u000a\u000aTo me they have a very noticeably different sound than their older stuff.\u000a\u000a\u000aSure some songs have that old feel to them, but a lot of them like heavy heart are very different.\u000aThoughts?
p6355
aVHeavy Heart sounds like pop metal, the chorus line is very catchy. 
p6356
aVFour songs in and really don't think I'll be listening to this at all.  Just sounds too much like emo pop Rock (I think its the vocals. Haven't had an issue in the past but these are a whole new level). Maybe my musical tastes have changed in the past few years but it sounds like a poor man's version of sky harbor with a touch of DT thrown in.  
p6357
aVIf you liked P2 and haven't listened to Omega yet, I highly recommend it. Reprise and Priestess are still pretty different, but the rest of Omega feels much more familiar and heavy.
p6358
aVYa I'll give omega a spin but I couldn't even make it through alpha.  Probably go back and listen to omega tomorrow.
p6359
aVYou gave up on alpha too early in the album. Trust.
p6360
aVMade it 45 seconds into scourge and just had to tap out at that point. If an album is absolutely horrendous 5 songs in, I'm not going to give the rest of it the benefit of the doubt.
p6361
aVThat's funny, because about two minutes later the album really digs in and displays some of its heavier P2'ish stuff.\u000a\u000aDo what you do, but remember that you're not really giving the full thing a chance.
p6362
aVThat's true and it looks like most people generally like the album which is nice.  I love the experimental nature of prog but it might just be a swing and miss for me which happens.
p6363
aVI understand the dislike for the first half of Alpha, but the second half makes up for it in my opinion. Hell, even the second half of The Scourge is awesome. You obviously don't have to listen to it, but I'd urge you to try and power through the rest.
p6364
aVSeriously, I love the scourge. Its the song that sends you into the best stuff the album has to offer. The breakdown and building tension get me so pumped, and then all hell breaks loose and it just feels like GOOD periphery again!\u000a\u000aI'm loving it.
p6365
aVI felt the same way you did when I first listened to the albums last week; besides a couple songs, I didn't like it at all. But the more I listen to them, the more I like them. There are a lot of melodies and musical themes that are reoccurring throughout both albums, and the more I listen to it the more I appreciate the way its all pieced together. At first I was disappointed that it wasn't musically "Periphery 3", but now I'm glad that its not.
p6366
aVThe instruments are great.  But I've finally found myself in the anti-spencer vocals group even though I enjoyed his vocals previously. I have yet to listen to omega but I just don't see getting over the vocals on alpha.  
p6367
aVDope. I have a long commute to and from work every day. I have a hard time listening to full records at home, I get distracted easily. 
p6368
aVVery interested in this information, thanks OP.  Now I can go back to not using Itunes again.

asV[Discussion] Periphery - Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega
p6370
(lp6371
VI think the pop nature of Alpha is representing the not so dire aspects of the story at that point and it takes a turn for the worst halfway through. Musically though I absolutely love both albums, they're so varied and extremely heavy. It sounds like Periphery but it's stuff they've never done before. 
p6372
aVAlso what to add the story about the album is kinda related to the book "The Shining."  Matt said he was rereading that book while working on the album. Go read up on it and the story makes a lot more sense.
p6373
aVI can't grasp the story until the lyric booklet comes with the CD's but I'll definitely look into it
p6374
aV[deleted]
p6375
aVI totally agree with this part. I really think some parts of the album just come off as more "poppy" because they are there to be theatric and serve the story. They are more about the mood they cultivate and whats happening in the storyline than what's going on instrumentally
p6376
aVLoving twinkle twinkle little star at the end of Hell Below.
p6377
aVThey really outdid themselves with both albums. Their new direction still incorporates classic Periphery, but it's a real pleasure to hear how they've branched out. I hear influences from bands like Dillinger Escape Plan, Devin Townsend, and even stuff like Skyharbor, which all combines to form a still wildly original, prog-metal masterpiece. 
p6378
aV**Hell Below**\u000a\u000aJesus Christ, someone tell me there are more brutal songs out there, because I think I've been ruined from metal. I can't believe a song could sound so evil.
p6379
aVActually, I think P2 was poppier. \u000a\u000aEither way I think this is the best they've done so far. It has that balance between the melody, groove and aggressiveness they've been experimenting since the beginning.
p6380
aVThey have fucking done it. Periphery is raising the bar in the metal scene.  \u000a\u000aPeriphery is one of the few bands that has endless creativity and tight band chemistry. \u000a\u000aPeriphery I, II, and Juggernaut are all so drastically different, yet each one was a phenomenal album with no filler, as in every song had a purpose. \u000a\u000aI can't wait to see where these guys are a year from now, 5 years from now, and 10 years from now and so on.  \u000a\u000aMisha Mansoor is truly this generation's Jimi Hendrix, in my opinion. He knows how to produce and he knows how to play his instrument. He has produced and helped write on AAL's self titled and Joy of Motion. He has produced VoM's Eclipse and wrote 2 songs for the Halo 2 anniversary soundtrack. And he is extremely humble, which is something I highly respect.\u000a\u000aHis accomplishments speak for themselves. But Periphery isn't just Misha, it's Nolly, Jake, Matt, Spencer, and Mark. They were drawn to Misha's vision for Periphery and now are a supergroup as a result. \u000a\u000aFinally, Periphery has worked with Jeff Loomis, Guthrie Govan, and John Petrucci. 'Nuff said.\u000a\u000a

aVIf anyone is compared to Hendrix it should be Abasi for his unique approach to the instrument and innovation with technique. However I don't think anyone can be compared to Hendrix. He truely changed music. Animals as Leaders is too big of a niche to change music in the way that Hendrix did. \u000a\u000aHendrix was also remember for much more than musical contributions. Something that cannot be said about Abasi or Mansoor.
p6387
aVMisha actually has pretty poor technique for production.  He records guitars wayyy to hot.  It's a remnant from the early days of digital recording, where you recorded hot because the noise floor was high.  Nowadays it's just dumb and a bad thing to do because it neuters the track and forces you to use a limiter.
p6388
aVShh. No tears, only Misha the Maestro of Sound Production. Loud guitars = sound production.
p6389
aVWell Nolly engineered this time around so if you want to point fingers I'd say it's more at the ol' chap than Misha. 
p6390
aVThe pauses between tracks are definitely a by-product of the low quality.I wouldn't worry about that.\u000a

aVI've got The Scourge, Alpha and 22 Faces on iTunes because of preorder and they flow seamlessly on that.
p6392
aVBTBAM's Parallax 2 has skips between tracks too, the guy above is an idiot. If you actually buy and play the disc in a disc player the songs flow flawlessly.
p6393
aVAnother popular example of that happening is BTBAM's Parallax II. Unless that's also a quality issue? Anyway, I believe Periphery is competent enough to keep that in mind.
p6394
aVIt's either your audio player or the files you have.
p6395
aVIt's the files then. I never really questioned it, thanks.
p6396
aVif they are mp3 files I've read that a gapless playback isn't possible in that format. I have the same issue with my copy of parallax II
p6397
aVI have Fallujah's The Flesh Prevails in mp3 format and that doesn't happen. I might try downloading from different sources and experiment with what works and what doesn't.
p6398
aVthat's odd, I probably have mp3 albums that are fine as well, but I recently looked into my broken version of Parallax II to find out what was wrong, i'll probably buy the cd sometime
p6399
aVParallax 2 flows seamlessly on the physical album. Sounds like it might be your media player. 
p6400
aVThe actual albums don't skip at all if you play the discs in a player.
p6401
aVIt's just the gap in youtube playback, since there is no preloading for consecutive tracks
p6402
aVWe're talking about the actual leak. Both albums, 192kbps, the mp3s.
p6403
aVFor 192kbps it sounds really shitty. I can hear artifacts all over the place, it sounds more like 96kbps
p6404
aVFor 192kbps? 192 *always* sounds shitty. You can hear the difference in cymbal sounds immediately. I don't know why you guys would bother downloading a leak in that low of a quality, it would definitely ruin my first impression of the album.
p6405
aV&gt;  192 always sounds shitty. \u000a\u000aReally now. 192 CBR should be virtually transparent. I encode all my flac rips to 160~ VBR and it sounds just as good as flac to me\u000a\u000aI even did a/b testing to make sure I couldn't hear any artifacts and I definitely can't
p6406
aVIt's always easiest for me to hear the difference in the cymbals- 192 or below can impart a "warbly" or uneven sound in them. I'm not really a digital music quality stickler (I tend to stick with v0 for everything) and I've never listened to a FLAC before, but I know that 90% of the time I can pick up on subtle artifacts in lower quality MP3s.
p6407
aVYeah the cymbals are what I always listen out for when in trying to find artifacts but even at V4 I'm just not hearing it. At 128 CBR is when artifacts become quite noticeable to me.
p6408
aVAnyone able to decipher the story? Some person involved in occult rituals obtains or has psychic abilities, gets captured tortured and brainwashed over the course of his/her life, breaks free and avenges those who've caused him/her great pain and ends up encountering bizarre paranormal entities and events is what I seem to be getting out of it.
p6409
aVI think a lot of people would be really interested in a quick write-up concerning this, if anyone has any ideas.\u000a\u000aOn a related note, Misha said a few days ago they were planning on releasing an official explanation of the story.

aVwww.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2taf89/so_juggernaut_is_fing_my_s_right_up/ this guy basically nailed the description of what I heard as the story perfectly.
p6411
aVthis was awesome to read and from my own experience reading the lyrics this is pretty spot on. There is actually not a song on these two releases that I dislike. I'm really finding the flow and overall compositions of the two releases to be really complimentary of each other. Where I feel that Alpha has run its course with the more pop-ridden elements Omega comes in and balances the entire situation out. \u000aIdk about everyone else but the song Priestess is one of my favorite songs they've ever written.
p6412
aVLittle late to the party but I always thought it was some person BORN during occult and devilish practices. Like so he could harbor the soul of a demon or the devil or something. By then you get to heavy heart and I imagine a teenager growing up with a literal demon inside him. So that's where the poppy sadness comes from. With alternating thoughts of coping with a demon I inside you and trying to live a normal life like that. \u000a\u000aBy psychosphere, I imagine our protagonist has committed his first string of cultish murders himself but on a small scale. By reprise, he's sacrificing dozens of children to lucifer. Can't really explain priestess. \u000a\u000aBy graveless, he's sacrificed himself whether out of defiance or subservience to the evil one. The rest of the album then involves his journey into hell, his seeking for redemption from whoever and eventual release amongst the stars.\u000a\u000aI don't get how anyone got the shining  out of there lol. No offense.
p6413
aVI have to disagree about Stranger Things, I thought Stranger things was the best song on the album, the emotion and flow of the song blew me away. But to each their own!
p6414
aVIMO Omega is their best song to date. The only song that I don't really enjoy is The Bad Thing. That breakdown makes me facepalm so hard.
p6415
aVReally? I think The Bad Thing is on pretty much on par with Omega.\u000a\u000aI think Omega is going to be the darker, more proggy brother to Alpha. Harder hitting and whatnot.
p6416
aVThe Bad Thing's breakdown screams of Josh Travis (Glass Cloud/Tony Danza) influence. Sure, it's not as proggy or complex as other parts but I'll be damned if it isn't one of the heavier bits Juggernaut that I've heard so far.
p6417
aVAny idea where the video went for that track? It looks like they removed it.
p6418
aVThat little part at the end of Hell Below is groovy as fuck. 
p6419
aVI honestly think that this is their metropolis pt.2.  I like that this is different; it keeps them from getting stale and I think this is what periphery wanted to do when they started the band.  Im also sick of people getting so butt hurt over it not being what they want.  They are a fucking progressive metal band, which means they progress!  Overall I think this album will be THE album to beat for 2015.
p6420
aV&gt;this album will be THE album to beat for 2015.\u000a\u000aHand. Cannot. Erase.
p6421
aVComing back to this comment after listening the shit out of both albums... Both great, but too different to compare I'd say. Steve Wilson isn't even metal, just has some influence from it. That's not a bad thing either. Hand cannot erase is beautiful, poppy, yet super proggy (took me forever to figure out that 21 count phrase in ancestral)\u000a\u000aPersonally, if I HAD to pick I'd say juggernaut but that's only because I'm a metal head. \u000a\u000aOne thing that both albums get right is that they don't go for a "proggy sound" but are still very progressive in nature. Which honestly is how progressive music should be. Going for a "prog" sound is no more progressive than any other genre of music
p6422
aVYou say this when Steven Wilson and BtBaM, along with several others, still have albums to be released this year.
p6423
aVDifferent strokes for different folks.
p6424
aVI mean it's pretty much over if corelia drops something this year. 
p6425
aVToo true.
p6426
aVYeah, it's been hard having just 7 songs to live off of the past 3 or 4 years. But, hey at least they are coming out with 90 minutes of work.
p6427
aVI like Corelia, but you are fucking high bro. Good laughs.

aVHoping for a Dream Theater renaissance miracle\u000a\u000a

aVIf we don't get that, at least we have Haken's to look forward to, and they're only getting better.
p6430
aVI think everyone is, but it probably won't happen :(
p6431
aVPeriphery fans acting like the band holds a candle to BTBAM kind of annoy me, for some strange reason.
p6432
aVIt's all just preference... Some people sincerely like periphery more than btbam
p6433
aVI certainly do. Btbam is just dream theater with screams to me. Sure it's proggy by nature, but its not *different*. That's where periphery excels. Not everything they do is super out there, but every single piece of music they have released is unlike anything I've ever heard. Except for clear. That never happened.
p6434
aVI've gotta disagree. Btbam takes many more chances musically than dream theater. IMO if you've listened to enough of each band there is no way you can compare them any more than you can compare periphery and btbam
p6435
aVI couldn't agree more.
p6436
aVI'm so pumped, I feel like this year will be full of great albums.\u000a\u000aPeriphery\u000a\u000aCorelia\u000a\u000aSymphony X\u000a\u000aetc.

aVYou're fine. Discussion in the sub is very welcome. People are going to talk about it anyway. Legal streams are very welcome to be posted and we will remove illegal links if people forget to read the rules in the sidebar.
p6438
aV' The last chorus, reprising Alpha's chorus, works perfectly. And the breakdown is fucking amazing. Then Strange Things comes on and, while it's not a bad song, it kind of just drags the album on unnecessarily.'\u000a\u000aYeah I love Stranger Things but felt it should have been an earlier song. I would've liked it if the album faded out with that heavy ass breakdown at the end of Omega but I suppose it main be contradictory to the story.
p6439
aVThat's exactly it. I understand that song is there for a reason but come on, anything after those last few minutes in Omega will inevitably dissapoint.
p6440
aVJust my stupid opinion here so don't get too upset but I really do not like the songs like "the scourge." it seems like the more I try to like them the more I hate them. I love periphery but their new direction is not my\u000acup of tea. Sorry for not sucking their dick but periphery got weird to me, and not in a good way. I don't want to compare them to other bands because I don't think it's fair but I will beat the dead horse and admit that I don't like Spencers vocals. \u000a\u000aSo now that I've doused myself in gasoline, go ahead and light the match. 
p6441
aV&gt; So now that I've doused myself in gasoline, go ahead and light the match.\u000a\u000aWow, this is excellent scream-sing post-hardcore lyric writing right here, dude.  \u000a  \u000aI'm definitely going to give the full double album a few listens but I simply preferred the metalcore sound on the S/T to anything on PII or the singles I've heard from this. I can look past Spencer's vocals becoming more and more over the top but the drastic style change disappoints me. More power to them, just wish they had continued in that direction.
p6442
aVI fucking love The Scourge, really builds up an eery atmosphere, like you can feel that the story is about to take a dark turn. I first listened to Periphery a few years ago and just couldn't get into them because of the vocals, but I'm really starting to love Spencer's voice.
p6443
aVI love The Scourge as well! Yeah, it's a slower song that takes its time building but the nature of it makes it actually sound HUGE! It's actually one of my favorites so far!
p6444
aVI actually think The Scourge is one of the strongest tracks of the album, the track begins soft with a very melodic Sotelo but then progress into some Devin Townsend's vibe at the end. Also, the atmosphere at the middle of the track sounds very Vildhjarta's style.
p6445
aVI felt that the middle section was *very* korn
p6446
aVOnly because it sounds like Jonathan? Hahaha\u000a\u000aIt does sound like Jonathan but not like Korn.
p6447
aVI agree that "the scourge" isn't a very good track, but I completely disagree with the rest of your post. \u000a
p6448
aVI'll say this: I typically am the one who gets upset when bands try new things. I set unrealistic expectations on music most times and its something I have to work on.  Having said that, I wasn't a huge fan of these riffery tracks as they debuted them. I can tell you the turning point was about 5 listens per song for me.  The Bad Thing, was the first one.  Suddenly the chorus got really catchy to me which begged for more listens.  I've listened to this stream all morning and I thought I only appreciated the later half of the album.  Now the only song I have a problem with is the "Black Minute" but I can already tell its growing on me.  I think you just have to take time to listen to these tracks to appreciate them. Its a different style so maybe the time it takes to enjoy it won't come as fast as say maybe some of the tracks off of the self titled album when we all first heard Periphery and that's ok too.  You can't force it either, just have to naturally shed those expectations on your own and see it for what it was intended to be.  Just think about how awesome these tracks are going to sound when their next album comes out. Just like how PII was to PI. Its human error man and all in our heads. 
p6449
aVDon't quote me on this, but wasn't Alpha supposed to be more "experimental" in the vein of Clear while Omega was more aggressive and more similar to P/P2?
p6450
aVOther way around
p6451
aVThat's weird, because the two singles from Omega were a lot more aggressive than the three from Alpha. (Possibly barring 22 Faces). I'm listening to Sumerian's album stream now and it definitely reminds me more of Clear.\u000a\u000aEDIT: nvm just made it to rainbow gravity
p6452
aVDat Rainbow Gravity
p6453
aVI really can't compare either album to their previous stuff. Obviously there are some similarities, but it's not as simple as comparing one to Clear and one to P/P2. There's overlap in my opinion.
p6454
aVHave any of the pre-orders come with lyrics yet? I remember a few years back one of the guys said the overall Juggernaut concept was about an immortal being of some variety, other comments here mention a man developing psychic abilities, being brainwashed and meeting paranormal beings, not able to piece together any ideas myself so far but I'm loving the bits i can understand so far. 
p6455
aVit was posted earlier in the thread but check out the link for a pretty accurate representation of the lyrics themes going on. \u000a\u000ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2taf89/so_juggernaut_is_fing_my_s_right_up/
p6456
aVI heard that was the original idea, but that idea was scrapped and Spencer came up with something new more akin to an Akira like character. Either way I'm interested to read more about it.
p6457
aVThe guys were reading and watching a bunch of books and movies like Rosemary's Baby, The Shining, True Detective and the likes, and it connects with the album's themes of the occult, psychic abilities and murderous intentions a bit.
p6458

p6459
aVAwesome man, thanks for the share.
p6460
aVI absolutely love Juggernaut. Periphery has been one of my favorite bands these past few years and I'm glad that each album has a different feel to it. I'm pretty sure I will be listening to it a lot in the coming months, much like how I did with Periphery II.\u000a\u000aA few things I'd like to note about Juggernaut that really stood out for me:\u000a\u000a* The atmosphere is amazing. It's dark and mellow. It's exactly what I wanted to hear. As soon as I heard *The Scourge* back in November, I knew from the very beginning that it was going to an album I was going to love.\u000a* Has anybody noticed that towards the end of certain songs (*MK Ultra*, *Priestess*, *Hell Below*, and even *Omega*) it has a jazzy elevator music vibe to it? It's pretty cool and it's something I noticed when *Hell Below* finished.\u000a* Juggernaut ends right where it began. The best example I can give is how it was in Octavarium. At the very end of *Octavarium* you can hear *The Root of All Evil*, which is intentional. Well Juggernaut does that too, but I can't determine if it's intentional to the story or not. The same piano tune from *A Black Minute* is at the end of *Stranger Things*, which makes me think that the story sorta goes in circles.\u000a* From what I'm gathering right now from the lyrics (I may be completely wrong of course, I'm always lost without knowing the actual lyrics) that the main character was on the verge of death as a young child but there was some sort of sacrificial ritual that gave them back life. The character lives in seclusion and her family is some sort of cult. I'm trying to piece that together with everything in the album, but I'm pretty sure it's supernatural stuff. Another alternative theory I have is that the main character has some telekinesis/telepathic/psychokinesis powers and that person is tapping into the minds of others. Maybe all of their voices get in her heard and she rebels? I've also got a pretty huge hunch that the main character is a female. That's mainly based off of hearing "she" somewhere on the album, but it makes sense since the [most visible person on the Alpha cover looks like a female](http://i.imgur.com/ZJYmp6T.jpg).\u000a\u000aOverall I think I'm going to be making this one of my favorite albums ever. I've enjoyed it the many times I've listened to it today. It was worth ordering the t-shirt/physical CD bundle, buying each released song, and going to the concert. I can't wait until the CDs come in so I can actually have a higher quality version of the album. 
p6461
aVI really want the Cds and artwork so I can really get the entire feel of the album. The lyrics seem like they play a massive part in the mood and tone of the songs this time.
p6462
aVRainbow Gravity = Icarus 2.0 and its gr8
p6463
aVI've seen a lot of comments about the story, and just wanted to say that my friend sent me a picture of an interview with Halpern in Drum Magazine where he said that the story revolved around "a child born into a sadistic cult, his escape and subsequent life choices."\u000a\u000aIf this is true (and I think it more than likely is), the only concrete event I think I've found is in the Scourge which I believe is his escape ("I am now free"/"I will survive").\u000a\u000aSpeculation: On Matt Halpern's kick head is the full Alpha cover and in the background you can see many sets of eyes. So I think after the child escapes the "22 Faces" still haunt him, very vague I know. And my friend also has a theory that the elevator music shorts are the main character going in/out of the "crack in the earth" mentioned in The Bad Thing.
p6464
aVOh right, the elevator music. The first time I listened to the album I spouted a decisive "what the fuck" when I heard the "Laser Speed"-like outro in MK Ultra.
p6465
aVMy initial reaction was somewhere between a "this is interesting" and "fuck yeah", probably something like "this is fucking yeah" 
p6466
aVSounded like something out of the Gran Turismo menu screens to me :)
p6467
aVI personally don't think their albums are more poppy. Like I understand where people are coming from but I just think they had certain visions for certain songs or ways they wanted to go about with the writing progress. Also they experimented a lot more. Like its the first time (I guess) they do something somewhat jazzy. They also showed that they can be heavy if they want but what's the point of making a whole heavy album? That seems like something they'd do on another project and I think they of all people would find it extremely boring. Specially since they don't listen to much heavy stuff. \u000a\u000aOn another note they REALLY stepped up their game as far as how well the vocals go with the music. Spencer has always been one of my favorite vocalists because he always seems like he's out there to prove something due to how some of the fanbase feels about him. But in the periphery II everything just seemed really off with him. Like his vocals despite being great and much better than their first self titled didn't seem to fit. But this time around he just stomped it to be honest. This has become my favorite release from them. Mostly because I really wasn't expecting anything specific (as much as I want every periphery song to sound like zero from clear). They brought new stuff and really did a great job of making it fit well. My take on this release. 
p6468
aVI am absolutely loving the albums.  I've enjoyed Periphery's previous albums, but this is something else completely.  This is their opus in my opinion.  What has everyone thought of the story?  I'm still trying to piece it together.  It has a kind of Bioshock vibe to me.  Potential spoilers beyond this point? From what I've gathered our main heroine was born with esp or some kind of power to see glimpses of other dimensions.  The world she lives in during Alpha controls her and limits her abilities.  She feels trapped and wants to be free(Elisabeth from Bioshock Infinite anyone?).  In the beginning of Omega she manages to enter a rift to one of these other worlds.  "Transcend these earthly boundaries."  She finds things are much darker on the other side.  Still piecing together the occult bits that dominate Omega.  It sounds like she is trapped and forced to die over and over again.  The shared musical themes in this parallel universe seem to reinforce this idea.  Or maybe I'm completely wrong lol?  Any ideas?
p6469
aVIs it just me or is Priestess one of their most awesome songs ever?\u000aAnyone else get a definite Opeth vibe with it?
p6470
aVMark is a big Opeth fan and was the one who wrote the main theme/riff of this song so I could definitely see how something like the note shifts in "Hope Leaves" could be an influence. That was a run-on sentence. 
p6471
aVEpic run on sentence that was. I just thought the other day too that the entire ending section from 4:13 onward just sounds like it could have come from Damnation. Almost reminds me of To Rid The Disease.

p6485
aVGotcha! Well I will say I like Vod a lot better than ELE, and am excited to hear the rest of the album. Is it just me or is the quality lower/track quieter for the song than the teaser?
p6486
aVYeah that's possible. We went for a more natural production. No compression, everything's fine-tuned with EQs and such. That makes the sound a bit quieter, but there's a lot more dynamic range, and the quality of the sound is higher too. Just raise the volume a few notches more than usual and you'll get the same volume out! [Here's another example of quiet metal music](http://warpprism.bandcamp.com/)

Was Johnny just using Diz because it was party-time and was always playing for the end game of getting back Carmen or did Diz live out her ultimate dream of getting Johnny that she was clearly working towards the entire movie? Or maybe both? I don't know the answer but I hope deep down Johnny was just using Diz. I never liked Diz. Team Carmen for life. 
p6560
aVI think it was both.  Johnny was clearly a 10 when Diz was barely a 5.  And that shows by how un-devastated he is when she gets impaled.  He shoots the bug for more rounds than is even possible when he should be putting her out of her misery.  If that were Carmen, he would have beat bugsy to death with his own mitts.  \u000aJohnny was using Diz, how could you ever respect her after sergeant dude beats the piss out of her infront of the whole platoon?\u000aAnywho, I think you are on the right track.  Fuck diz, but Carmen was a piece of shit for a while there too...after all these years I have never known what to make of it all.
p6561
aVtits though
p6562
aVHey Luke! Just wanted to say thanks for all the inspriation you've given me over the years with your fantastic compositions. I even got you guys [permanently affixed](http://imgur.com/a/Tnf8i) to me over the last year.\u000a\u000aAnyhow, your style has clearly changed to become more and more progressive over the past few albums... are there any artists you have been listening to that may have influenced this direction?\u000a\u000aWhere is your favorite place to play on tour and why is it The Social in Orlando?\u000a\u000aWhat are some of your favorite and least favorite tracks to play live and why?\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks for everything man!
p6563
aVI have seen that tattoo before - nice one!\u000a\u000a\u000aI thought we went a little more straight forward on Volition as far as song writing went.  The songs feel more cohesive to me.  Although I am pretty close to it and very biased.  \u000a\u000a\u000aWe first discovered progressive music with Liquid Tension Experiment.  I think we have spent every moment since then trying to be that.\u000a\u000a\u000aI do like the social in Orlando (if I am remembering the right venue).  but my favourite place to play will always be NFLD.  Magical place where it rains booze.\u000a\u000a\u000aFavourite tracks to play live, one from each album:  Mist, Bury the Hatchet, Bloodmeat, Dunsel\u000a\u000aLeast favs:  I actually don't have a least fav, I am more scared of certain songs than others though!
p6564
aVWhat songs are you scared of? And why are you scared of them?
p6565
aVmainly the ones where I wrote guitar lines that may have been over my head.  Sure, I can bucker down in a comfortable studio chair and get them out as no one watches - but totally different story when I am nervous on stage and people might as well have microscopes on my fingers.
p6566
aVOne time I told you that I was going to analyze your performance and upload a review to the forums for all to scrutinize. It was sarcasm but I feel bad now. Sorry for the added stress. :/
p6567
aVIt's really humbling to know that even your mighty (and incredibly handsome) self doesn't get it perfect every time.
p6568
aV[deleted]
p6569
aVI wish you guys had played Dunsel at the Toronto show! It was still incredible though.
p6570
aVBury the hatchet literally gives me the chills.
p6571
aVThat's probably my favorite part of Volition... how the music is still insane, yet seems more thought-out and methodical instead of piecing a bunch of parts together. \u000a\u000aAny chance of y'all ever having longer sets? I know it's taxing to play such difficult material for an hour but it'd be awesome to have you guys up there for a little more than an hour
p6572
aV[deleted]
p6573
aVThat's a great looking tattoo man!
p6574
aVthat ink is pretty math, im jelly
p6575
aVwhen did math become a compliment? i cant keep up with kids these days
p6576
aVYour tattoo is incredibly enviable, holy that is a labour of love.
p6577
aVThat's so fucking solid man, I've wanted a Scurrilous tattoo for ages. But I think I'm going to go with something Fortress-esque only because it's my favourite album of all time. 
p6578
aVLove the social. So cozy. 
p6579
aVI also have a Scurrilous tattoo, except on my lower arm. It's been finished a while. Luke saw it at the album release party I believe.\u000a\u000ahttp://imgur.com/a/Qm1rl\u000a\u000aYours is rad too.
p6580
aVIs that a dragon ball? 
p6581
aVYou bet it is, snuck it in there
p6582
aVI have a Fortress cover inspired tattoo on my right shoulder!
p6583
aVdid you see them with Maylene and the Sons of Disaster some years ago? Was a good show. I am talking about The Social of course.
p6584
aVYeah. That show with Tesseract was one of the best shows I've ever seen. I was so stoked that they played both Dunsel and Bone Marrow
p6585
aVDo you boys keep in touch with Moe and Riffy? 
p6586
aVyes - although I haven't heard from old riff in a while.  I know both of them keep busy, I can't go anywhere without seeing riffy post about a show he is playing with one band or another.\u000a
p6587
aVAwesome man, great to know you fellers are on good terms still. 
p6588
aVCan you agree that Propagandhi is the greatest band of all time? And that their mighty riffs shift the earth's tectonic plates?
p6589
aVThat band is more special to me than anything else in music.  I agree fully.
p6590
aVThat answer makes me happy :) Was stoked for the Chris guest vox on Sex Tapes and The Rod on Underbite
p6591
aVWhat if I told you people felt that way about your band?
p6592
aVAny links to their music? Not seeing em on Spotify\u000a\u000aEdit: youtube. i'm an idiot
p6593
aVMake sure you only check out the albums from "Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes" and onwards. They were an average skate punk band (with awesome lyrics) in the 90s then once 2000 hit they became a glorious combination of thrash, prog and punk. Their newest album, Failed States is a perfect starting point. If you're into stuff similar to PTH (I'm assuming you are) check out the song "Status Update". Your brain will be on the floor. \u000aAlso I could have sworn Propagandhi was on Spotify but if not, good old YouTube will work just fine.\u000a
p6594
aVI'll check em out, thanks!
p6595
aVHey Luke! Where do you draw influences from when writing?   Are there any besides other bands/guitarists?  I guess on a broader scope, whats your writing process like? 
p6596
aVThe tendency is to draw influence from current stuff - contemporary music that I wanna rip off basically.  However, we always try to find ideas in older stuff (classical, soundtrack, what have you).\u000aWriting process is always evolving - last time was done mainly sitting in front of a computer.  Where as scurrilous was painfully hashed out by jamming.  I like both ways, but am hoping we find a better balance this time.
p6597
aVI had a feeling there was cinematic moments! I remember when scurrilous was being made/released you guys released a video with a track from inception.  Then i heard tandem and i noticed a chord progression from inception and  wondered if if there 'night bee some connection.' 
p6598
aVstrange coincidence, my pals John, cam and I are listening to the man of steel soundtrack right meow (also by Hans).  I had plans of ripping on the inception soundtrack in the future but didn't deliberately on Scurrilous.  Hi Milen!
p6599
aVHey man!  If I hear anything resembling "Flight" (Man of Steel) from you guys I'll have to do my best to not be a giddy faced idiot
p6600
aVthe contemporary rip-off thing really resonates with me. I get a TON of progression ideas from contemp music and soundtrack type things. This may also be due to the fact that ive been listening to PTH for the better part of 9 years or so.
p6601
aVI feel if you guys went the route that ADTR went you would soar. 
p6602
aVwhich route is that?
p6603
aVDon't! ADTR sucks and you guys rule &lt;3
p6604
aVWell after leaving Victory they pretty much do everything on their own their own way. They are a bit more popular than you guys, though nowhere near the talent. I feel like that's what people think I am suggesting is become ADTR. Not at all. Independent recording, touring, merch, label-free the way to be. 
p6605
aVWriting about high-school and leaving your home down over and over and over?
p6606
aVHey Luke, I was wondering if there were any specific exercises you did to get your right hand so solid, I've been trying to learn how to play your stuff for years and just can't quite keep up on a lot of it.\u000a\u000aAlso, I love you guys so much. Thanks for being hilarious, cool dudes and making amazing music.
p6607
aV/r/nsfw 
p6608
aV&gt;it's my first day\u000a\u000aSure it is. 
p6609
aVThe plight of being a lefty, I'll never be able to compensate for those ~15 years of forearm gains he has on me.
p6610
aVI have a few 15lbs weights I lift while I watch TV. It helps. 
p6611
aVthat's not a bad idea, thanks
p6612
aVI'm curious about how successful the crowdfunding for Volition was. It certainly seemed like you guys embraced it and did it "the right way" -- being forthright with the expenses and costs, etc. So while it seemed to me to be a huge success, I'm wondering if you guys view it the same way.\u000a\u000aAlso, any plans for a new album soon? I'm really looking forward to hearing the direction you guys go next.
p6613
aVDefinitely a success.  It pretty much changed our perspective on the industry and our own future.  We made tons of mistakes but have spent the last year trying to slowly right all the wrongs.  If we did it again, I feel like everything would run a lot smoother.  I will say it was one of the most exciting times of my life.\u000aNew album is on the way!
p6614
aVI'm glad you guys got yourself out of that financial rut. I had no idea about it until you released your crowdfunding campaign. I'm glad you found a way to make it work, lord knows that the industry can turn a lot of people into cynics
p6615
aVWaiting to see how y'all top Volition.
p6616
aVHey Luke. Any chance we'll hear more songs in a similar style to "Mist"? By that I mean fast, melodic, almost bordering on commercial with enough riffage to keep it grounded. Personally I grew up on melodic punk rock so that track hits all the right spots for me and you guys nailed it. Truly is my favourite PTH track.
p6617
aVThanks eh!\u000aWe have the same punk roots and will never be able to escape them (not that we want to).  It feels right.  \u000aI hope we right some bangers like that in the future too!
p6618
aVGotta agree. Mist hit all the right chords with me. Genuinely beautiful song with riffing and melodies that reminded me of bands like Strung Out (which is a very good thing).
p6619
aVLove Strung Out man.
p6620
aVI don't even like punk really and i loved Mist. Half for the music, half for the idea that the band wrote it from the heart, from a place of true love and appreciation for a place.
p6621
aVAre you gonna write another concept album like Kezia? I love love LOVE that story and how you organized the songs on the album.\u000aP.S. Tour with BTBAM please and thanks
p6622
aVIt's cool those lyrics still resonate with people.  It was definitely all Arif on that one.  Concept albums are such a treat - I hope we can do one again in the future.  Might need to bribe riffy though.
p6623
aVI'll give him my first born. I'll need about....10 months on that though
p6624
aVOh yes listen to this guy PTH + BTBAM = &lt;3
p6625
aVit worked for Coheed and Cambria and BT and the BAMs, also worked well with The Kindred. Would love to catch BTBAM with PTH or Periphery. Or Haken *drools*\u000a
p6626
aVPTH, BTBAM and Haken... I would die. 
p6627
aVFor sure. Coheed with BTBAM is hands down the craziest concert I've ever been to. Hell hath no fury like a mosh pit during a folk banjo break during Ants of the Sky . Followed by Favor House Atlantic later on. I did not survive, had to leave the pit lol
p6628
aVAs a major Coheed fan who's been to many concerts, it weirds me out every time people up front are moshing so hard. The music is not even that heavy!
p6629
aVMoshing isn't for heavy music, its for fun! It's an expression of empathy. 
p6630
aVHaha it threw me off more than anything. It was fun though
p6631
aVI went to that tour as well, was pushed up against the barrier for the whole show. No escape
p6632
aVI came just thinking about this tour... god damnit ! 
p6633
aVBack in 2009 right after Fortress came out i saw protest tour with BTBAM, in flames and killswitch. Such an amazing show
p6634
aVSo, where has Arif been? Is he staying with the band? Also, How much longer do you guys see yourself writing albums and touring?
p6635
aVI think we softened the blow with that one with out announcements when he decided to walk away.  And now it's our fault that there is some confusion over the whole deal.  For the record, he is no longer a member of pth.  However, we hope he will make an appearance or two in the future in some way or another.  Dear god, I have clouded things again...
p6636
aVI don't see clouds anywhere.\u000aDude has his own projects, but if he has time to contribute in some stuff for his old band, he's gonna do it.\u000aI don't see why a band must have permanent members all the time, live goes on and people move back and forth.
p6637
aVI'm bummed to read that.
p6638
aVHey Luke, it's Josh Hainge from the 1:25 minute mark in Skies.\u000a\u000aHopefully this comment doesn't come off as seeming too self-serving; I was just wondering how you and the rest of the band felt about giving up so much of your CD to guests.  I suppose it took more away from Rody than anyone else but I'm wondering how it affected the rest of the band, too, and whether or not you'd consider doing something similar to support a future crowd-funding endeavor.\u000a\u000aP.S.  Last time you guys were in Edinburgh, Rody offered to let me up on stage the next time you're here playing Skies; you all plan on holding that up?  (*That* was self-serving...)
p6639
aVTruth is, we didn't expect anyone to pull that kind of money together for the perk.  It was one of those things we laughed about and thought "we will take this down in a day".   But someone bought it on the first day (someone you might know ;).  \u000aIf you can look past the huge expense - it turned into a formidable experience for both us and you (we hope).  I couldn't have imagined a classier bunch of guys coming in and laying down their parts like they had been doing it for years.\u000aI was also proud of Rody and his ability to teach you guys and pull great performances out of everyone.  I would do it again, but not for the insane price tag.
p6640
aVMy internet shit the bed last night, so I didn't get the chance to follow the ama for very long after I posted...\u000a\u000aI actually tried to pay the first day but it took me a lot longer than I expected to convince my parents to let me do it (my card didn't have a high enough limit, so I needed the help even though I could afford it at the time), so I'm glad someone bought it and kept it posted.  If you guys lowered the price, wouldn't you be worried about too many people trying to get on board?  I know if I ever see it again, I'm gunning for it unless you stick a limit of one feature per person on it or something.\u000a\u000aAs for the experience, it was fricken unreal.  Hands down one of the best days of my life even though I was too nervous to properly socialize and had to bail early.  And it was made all the better when Volition actually came out and I got to hear that my money went towards making some of the best music I've ever heard.
p6641
aVHey man, I totally forgot about that perk. Good Job on your part! 
p6642
aVWhat's next for Protest the Hero? Will the next album be independent? Will it feature the new members? Will it be released this year?
p6643
aVWe just started writing!  It's always a daunting feeling - a mountain to climb, but I think we are ready...\u000aWe are currently deciding how to go about releasing the new album.  I feel like the traditional label route is asking for failure - we tried that for 3 albums.  
p6644
aVTo me it definitely feels more personal donating toward the album before its even made, from my standpoint I would love for you guys to go with crowdfunding again. That being said, if you can somehow use your crowdfunding experience as evidence to strongarm a label into giving you what you actually deserve then go for it. Also on crowdfunding I really liked all the opportunities to get unique swag (guitar picks/hoodies etc.)
p6645
aVNo matter how I look at a label, I am not persuaded you need them for the whole package of being in a successful band.  We have learned a lot over the years and can do lots of it on our own.  I guess that in itself is a bargaining chip?\u000aI am still in love with the idea behind crowdfunding.  Puts you and your fans in a position of power - and we mean it when we say we appreciate every single person who contributed.
p6646
aVWill Protest ever come back to Kansas? I know havent heard *come to ____city* My real question is oddly specific, in Blindfolds Aside @1:08 there is like a random flat note. Any idea what that was? Was it not caught or purposely in there? 
p6647
aVIf you are referring to a vocal line - Juice and Rody (cheese), were very thorough.  Cheese refuses to use pitch correction and it probably had something to do with them liking that particular performance despite it being off by a cent or two.  Back then, bands didn't polish the living shit out of their records as much as now.  I know, I know, it's still a polished record.  But we did make a point of leaving in stuff we liked because it was either spur of the moment, or made us laugh while we were drunk.
p6648
aVI did more digging and listened to couple different versions, some definitely dont have it so somebody caught it. I listened to a couple and it wasnt there so I was beginning to believe I imagined it. But I found it in this one. It's at 1:43 before "a sin". I actually called Metal Injection and asked Rody about it he had no idea what i was talking about but then again I'm sure you guys dont listen to your own CDs as much as I do. Love you guys, thanks for answering. Please come to Lawrence again. Please. Please.\u000a@1:42 \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8efz4eAnAqc
p6649
aVAfter I first heard PTH I downloaded Kezia from a 'less than reputable' website to check them out, and I always noticed my version having that sound in it too. I imagine it is a blemish from whoever ripped and uploaded the album to torrent websites  - sounds like an alert from a program like MSN or something. If you watch the music video, the audio in that doesn't have that blemish.
p6650
aVWell I'm glad someone else noticed it at least! 
p6651
aVHahah yes man i hear it every single time :)
p6652
aVMaybe it's just that one upload? Have you hard it on a physical or direct download of the tune?
p6653
aVI think it is on one upload, but that upload was the one that circulated piracy websites and subsequently was downloaded a lot. There are a few versions uploaded on Youtube (including the official audio from the music video) that don't have it, so as far as I can tell on legit versions there's no beep. Basically it wasn't something that the mastering team behind Kezia left in as the OP was thinking, rather it was accidentally added by the person who ripped the album and uploaded it to the internet.\u000a\u000aSo probably half the people that have Kezia will have heard that beep, and the other half who bought the album legit will have no idea.
p6654
aV[deleted]
p6655
aVYou're that guy! I listened to the radio show. That is just a bad version of the song recorded off of someones computer and that noise is just an instant messaging service going off.
p6656
aVSeconded. Come to Lawrence, please. 
p6657
aVTell us about your current rig (including what pick ups your using :))\u000aI love tacos.
p6658
aVIt's mainly *cringe* axe fx now a days.\u000aFor a musician who travels, every aspect of it makes sense.  I do miss that warmth and transparency of tube though.  I still have my beloved splawns and VHT amps that I will always adore though.  You never know when those could get subbed back in.\u000a\u000a\u000aPicks ups are always changing.  I want to try BKPs but just haven't gotten around to it yet.  I generally come back to Duncans and Dimarzios though - my first set of duncans (duncan distortion) really woke me up to the difference of a quality pickup.  I spent every dollar I had back then paying for it haha.  Memories.
p6659
aVI just put in my first set of decent pickups a month ago.  I chose the Seymour Duncan SH-2 and SH-5, which I read is what you use in your ibanez s. I feel like a god now. 
p6660
aVbut Luke... what about the tacos?!
p6661
aVHey Luke. What colour will my Kezia vinyl be?!
p6662
aVI am going to Samo (where we print our stuff) tomorrow and hashing it out all out.  Very open to your opinions.
p6663
aVThose purple Fortress vinyls were sexy as fuck
p6664
aVBlack as the blackest black times infinity
p6665
aVBlood red
p6666
aVPlease make Fortress purple pleasepleaseplease
p6667
aVPINK
p6668
aVHey Luke! \u000a\u000aI believe that you and the band have existed since you were teenagers. Your previous drummer leaving made me think that you guys probably might not have had the "regular" life most teenagers and young adults had when growing up, being in a band with relatively big success, touring, etc. Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. \u000a\u000aAnyway, how do you feel about yourself and where are you right now as a person? Has being in the band for so long ever felt like "too much"? \u000a\u000aEDIT: Another question, which I apologize for if it's out of line. What do you guys do for a living other than the band? I'm guessing that even since you have so many fans ready to support what you do, it doesn't pay the bills completely. I'd like to know this for myself to have a better insight on what's it like being in a position as a musician like yours.\u000a\u000a
p6669
aVYou are right - we got started pretty young.  The success part varies - I guess success to us is the ability to live, be content, and pay our bills by playing music.  \u000a\u000aI think we kept a level head most of the time on the road - and have benefited from a very enriching decade plus of travelling the world.  Although that may not be normal, I think we are all better off for it.\u000a\u000aHaving said that though - I feel like the readjustment to normal life after a tour (and inevitably when we hang this career up) is tough and will only get tougher.  There is a lot of growth and maturation we have sacrificed to be on the road.  It adds up over the years and shapes who you are.  Ask any of our friends, we are a weird bunch these days.
p6670
aVHey Luke. I've got a pretty serious question.\u000a\u000aWould you consider a burger a sandwich?
p6671
aVgod no.
p6672
aVThat's fucking bullshit and you know it. A sandwich is stuff between two pieces of bread. The Wikipedia article for burger states it's a sandwich. I work making burgers and we call them sandwiches. Fuck you, I don't like PtH anymore and I'm deleting all your music off my phone. \u000a\u000aToday you hurt my feelings Luke. Only a Luke would do that. And you did it. Thanks :c
p6673
aVI know Rody is pretty vocal with his hatred towards Djent, but how do you feel about it?
p6674
aVI have been found drunkenly moshing by myself to Meshuggah while in a bus on warped tour.  Hard.  More than once.  I love the idea, but hate the name.
p6675
aVWe've all been there
p6676
aVHi Luke, you make me very frustrated because PTH is one of my favorite bands and I can't play along with any Protest the Hero song on my guitar. Feels bad, but it's a constant reminder that I need to practice more, so thanks for that.\u000a\u000aWhat are some of your favorite bands currently?
p6677
aVAlways: Mars Volta, BTBAM, Coheed, Extreme, Propagandhi, Blotted Science, Sikth\u000a\u000aCurrently: Big Wreck, Periphery, A Wilhelm Scream, Plini, CHON, Hanson
p6678
aVTHE MARS VOLTA!? OH my god im bout to hyper ventilate like a 13 yr old school girl!! I cant even begin to describe my love for both protest and mars volta, my favorite bands of all time hands down.\u000a\u000aBrody and Cedric have that voice that just hits my ears in a way nothing else can!\u000a\u000aIts really cool to hear that your a fan!!  \u000a 
p6679
aVCHON! YES! I've fucking loved these guys since day 1!
p6680
aVExtreme is a surprising one! 
p6681
aVWill you be seeing Periphery in Toronto? (BTW we share a lot of commonalities in bands we enjoy, especially Hanson)
p6682
aVYou probably won't read this since the ama is over but since you've heard plini what are your thoughts on Sithu Aye? Would you ever have any of them guest appear or appear on one of their albums yourself?
p6683
aVSweet, the guitarist of my favorite band just listed my 2nd and 3rd favorite bands as some of his favorites too (Coheed and CHON respectively). Awesome to hear.\u000a\u000a\u000aP.S. Still waiting on those Anthology Packs on Sheet Happens :P
p6684
aVA Wilhelm Scream, you have good taste in punk my friend.
p6685
aVparty crasher has easily become one of my favourite albums ever I think.  It does all the things my teenage and current self would agree with.
p6686
aVhey man, did you guys even had pubes when you wrote search for the truth??
p6687
aVI honestly don't know.  Penises are all the same size for sure though.
p6688
aVThanks for doing this AMA, Luke!\u000a\u000aYou've been a huge inspiration for the last 6 years of my life and I've had an obsession with the pth albums you've released since then. Here are my questions! \u000a\u000aWhat is your writing process and how has it changed over the years? What is your approach to writing a riff or solo? Particularly on the new volition album. \u000a\u000aAny chance we will see you and Tim doing guitar play through similar to those of scale the summit or intervals? \u000a\u000aLastly, Do you ever learn the songs of the bands you promote on sheet happens? Which has been the most challenging in your opinion?\u000a\u000aThanks! \u000a\u000a

aVWriting process on volition was extensively done with Guitar Pro.  4 or so songs were written by sitting down and hashing them out (moe, tim, and myself).  I would prefer to better balance the mix of couch writing and rehearsal space jamming on this next album.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe are planning on doing our first real guitar play through in Feb.  We refuse to do the standard 'sit in a chair' idea though.  Expect something pretty stupid.\u000a\u000a\u000aI generally learn sections of songs and rarely an entire one.  When I am learning anything on guitar, the motivation is generally to incorporate whatever it is into my own songs (pth songs).  \u000a\u000a\u000aAll of the bands on SH are gifted guitar (and bass) players.  I have learned tons just from editing the living piss out of those books!
p6690
aVWhy do you feel that the traditional label route is failing?
p6691
aVThat too complicated a question for someone as stupid as myself to answer properly.\u000aThe short answer is probably the fact the an entire industry was too slow to change.
p6692
aVhey luke, how often do you almost shit yourself? any close calls? elaborate. have a splendid day
p6693
aVFinally - a question worth answering.\u000a\u000a\u000aLike all of us, I have had my share of scares.  In our band, we have an unspoken motto.  And that is "trust every fart".
p6694
aVHey Luke,\u000a\u000aWould love to know what it was like working with Chris Adler in the studio and how much of the drums he came up with and how much were already there.\u000a\u000aSaw you guys at KOKO in London, fantastic as per...
p6695
aVIt was a pleasure.  Real good guy, musician, and drinker of Heineken.  He came up with a whole bunch of the drum ideas himself.  We wanted him to have some freedom and approach it any way he wanted.  Having said that, Cam had a lot of the drums written up with programmed sounds.  They were a guideline for chris to hint at stress and direction we saw it heading.  Sometimes he played them verbatim and other times he might as well have given us the finger.  We were happy with both scenarios.
p6696
aVWill you guys be crowd-funding the new album? If not, what other options are you guys considering?\u000a\u000aIf you guys decide to crowd-fund, what would you do differently?\u000a\u000a(Definitely down for participating in round 2 of crowd-funding! Saw you in Ottawa at the end of December, thank you so much for an incredible night.)
p6697
aVNot sure yet.\u000a\u000aI would change more things than I could type here.  I hope to write a full article / column about what I view as the learning lessons from the campaign so that other bands can take it and make what they want of it.\u000a\u000a\u000aI personally would like to do one again, but everyone in the band has to agree on something before it's a lock!
p6698
aVYo Luke! It seems like the last few years have been the most volatile for you guys (strictly from the outside perspective of members moving on for the first time.) Do you think this will have a great affect on your new material? Will you guys possibly branch out to places we wouldn't expect of PtH because of the new chemistry of the group as a whole? I'm excited regardless! \u000a\u000aThanks for nearly a decade of my favorite music!
p6699
aVIt's hard to say.  Those guys will be missed for all sorts of reasons.  BUT!  There is a new sense of focus that popped up since they left...I guess it made us remaining members realize how much we loved it and how fragile it can be.  We just want to keep pushing ourselves, while we can...
p6700
aVHello Luke!\u000aAs a bassist I wanna know that now when Arif is gone, will bass lines be as awesome as Arif's. (In his own way of course.)
p6701
aVIf cam records the bass, you can expect lots of treats.
p6702
aVHi Luke! Thanks for doing the AMA!\u000a\u000aI'm hoping to be the first person here to ask you to explain your apparent fear of 'night bees' I hope it isn't too scary for you to talk about.
p6703
aVThe fact that bees, which come out at night, is a scary idea that should be pretty self explanatory.  They are obviously supposed to be sleeping or something by that point, so it makes you wonder how crazy they are.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the contrary, I have had my worst experiences with day bees.\u000aLong story short: Tim and I were riding bikes on a trail in toronto.  We were going fast.  A day bee flew into my neck and must have gotten stuck between my helmet strap and adam's apple (yes I have a helmet, and yes, - the adam's apple thing was an exaggeration).\u000a\u000a\u000aAnywho, he/she was obviously pretty upset that they were stuck and kept stinging me in the neck.  After that, four things happened:\u000a\u000a1. I grabbed the day bee in my hand to get it off.\u000a2. It stung my hand a bunch\u000a3. I fell off my bike \u000a4. The skies opened up and unleashed an unreal thunderstorm.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p6704
aVThen the idea for 'Skies'? (Sorry, it kind of fits though?)
p6705
aVThe absolute sincerity in this is so good.
p6706
aVThanks for answering! I will never trust a day or night bee again! And good on you for having a helmet, gotta protect that noggin!
p6707
aVWow, fucking step four there, lol.
p6708
aVI found out about you guys from Tap Tap revenge years ago, Bloodmeat. loved the track and instantly loved the band, I wondered if this was a common thing? And what your thoughts on this are? 
p6709
aVThat's kind of neat that you found out about us that way - seems like the popularity of that game was kind of short lived?  I know for sure that I was really bad at it.\u000aIt's cool when people find out about us like that, because who knows if you ever would have without it.  Little things like that can go a long way, we miss being in video games.  That was the best because you get a copy of the game for free (usually).
p6710
aVHey Luke! If you'd tell anyone that you play in a band, and he or she would not know Protest the Hero, what would you let them listen?
p6711
aVI definitely wouldn't push our music on anyone.  But if they insisted, I would probably show them Mist.  
p6712
aVHey Luke! What was the inspiration behind the video for Hair-trigger? It's just so amazing. 
p6713
aVkind of a funny story...\u000a\u000a\u000aThe video treatment was originally written for Tongue-splitter.  The song was named after the ability to think one thing and say the other (doublespeak if you will).  The idea for the video was to be playing crazy music while doing something else.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe quickly found out that we submitted the wrong song for a specific grant  (our gov't has a grant system for canadian artists of all genres).  We tried to switch the song but risked losing the grant.  We decided to move forward anyway, and I think it turned out better!
p6714
aVSo whats the story with the bees and you almost loosing your thumb?!?!
p6715
aVI already explained the bees.  Or tried to.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe thumb:\u000aMy brother and I used to brawl as soon as my parents would leave the house.  Exit parents, enter plunger in my hand.\u000aI was motioning to touch my brother Spencer's face with the plunger.  He obviously didn't like that and grabbed a giant, metal BBQ spatula to defend himself.  I entended my arm toward his face and he blocked it by bringing down the spatula (with the intention of perhaps knocking it out of my hand).  He connected with my thumb which was securing the spatula.  It split my thumbnail in half and pretty much cut off the tip of my thumb.  It was hanging on by a thread.\u000a\u000a\u000aFearing a grounding, we wrapped it up and pretended nothing had happened.  I couldn't feel anything since it had cut through the nerve.  The rest is history but because we didn't act fast, I was apparently lucky to "get it back".   I will say that stitches in your nail bed is pretty intense.
p6716
aVhttp://i.imgur.com/WRG9Awg.jpg\u000a\u000aWas this smile sincere? i hope so....When will you guys be returning to the Midwest?
p6717
aVI am angry most of the time.  If I smiled, it had to be sincere right?
p6718
aVHey Luke! As a hungarian i couldn't help but realize all the hungarian stuff going on in Palms Read's video. What building was it shot in or what does it have to do with Hungary?
p6719
aVThey actually discuss that in this interview (it's in Hungarian). Not to steal Luke's thunder or anything like that though haha.\u000a\u000aEdit: Forgot the link lol. http://nuskull.hu/interjuk/azt-hiszem-en-jo-villanyszerelo-lennek-interju-a-protest-the-heroval/
p6720
aVthanks for the clarification /u/gosca \u000a\u000aIt was a Hungarian Hall in Toronto - I would have to look up what it's called.  And I am just not prepared to do that.
p6721
aVLuke, if you could describe the next album with a vegetable, what vegetable would it be?
p6722
aVThis question
p6723
aVI got asked a similar question when I got interviewed for a job as a bus boy at Boston Pizza when I was 16.  I can't remember what I answered, but the important thing that I took away from it, was that it was a stupid question.
p6724
aVA stupid question deserves a stupid answer.
p6725
aVLuke what's more metal.\u000a\u000aA.  a skeleton bird devouring a human man who happens to be shredding Blood Meat as he dies. \u000a\u000aB.  A goat with a top hat, serving his victims red licorice chapstick before he sends them to their firey graves.\u000a\u000aC.  Protest the Hero playing in Newfoundland.\u000a\u000a
p6726
aVB.  It's the only one which doesn't have anything to do with us.
p6727
aVWhat's your method for writing riffs/songs? Do you just write as you go, or do you consider the structure of the whole song when you start writing it? How do you make sure that the songs "flow" says right?
p6728
aVIf I am writing on my own, I will usually come up with a handful of riffs / ideas that will work with each other (same key, same tempo, same motif, you get it).  If it doesn't flow - it will usually get the boot.\u000aThe structure gets juggled around until something feels like a song I guess.  it's an ongoing guess and test, and I think my best spots are when I am able to stop letting the big picture of each song scare me.  Just move forward and stop over thinking your work.  You always have the benefit of taking time away from it and coming back and realizing what sucks and what doesn't.
p6729
aVHow much music theory goes into your songwriting, if any?
p6730
aVwe used to pretend we knew a lot about that kind of thing.  Now a days we go for what 'feels' right.  The odd time though, we will make a point of pursuing something based on theory.
p6731
aVSpeaking of odd time, how the hell do you guys come up with some of your timings? Kezia and Fortress seem to be especially hectic. 
p6732
aVHey Luke, first off I want to say you're a very handsome man.\u000a\u000aHow do you dial in your live tone? Whenever I see you I'm impressed how smooth your lead tone sounds but how beefy your rhythm tone sounds. I assume you don't have time to change pickups between those riffs.
p6733
aV&gt; Hey Luke, first off I want to say you're a very handsome man.\u000a\u000aI know.\u000a\u000aTone wise, I think it's largely what our guy at front of house is doing.  He can take a relatively thin tone and make it sound beefy.  I am never satisfied with my stage sound - and now I have lost too much of my hearing to even trust myself...
p6734
aV&gt; &gt; Hey Luke, first off I want to say you're a very handsome man.\u000a\u000a&gt; I know.\u000a\u000aSmooth as hell.\u000a
p6735
aVHow much of a success was Volition to you guys?  Are you happy with how it did monetarily?  Critically?  Artistically (in your opinions)?\u000a\u000aFavorite song off of it?
p6736
aVWe are pretty proud of the album and corresponding record cycle.  My only regret is not doing a single support tour - headlining can get old, and doesn't necessarily put you in front of a lot of 'new' faces.  \u000a\u000a\u000aMonetarily, I can afford to pay my bills and take my lady out for dinner every now and then.  That's something I would have never believed when we first started.\u000a\u000a\u000aCritically is something that is totally out of our control, so as good as it feels to read a positive review, it feels pretty good to read a negative one too.  It just makes you better.\u000a\u000a\u000aFav song: Skies
p6737
aVHey Luke, thanks for being a musical inspiration to a legion of musicians around the globe! \u000a\u000aI had a question about song writing, how do you try to stay fresh? push yourself forward? and generally not get stuck repeating yourself? Protest the Hero is one of the few bands that continue to sound fresh and exciting album after album; it is quite impressive! 
p6738
aVIt's hard to stay fresh, especially after 4 full length albums.  At the same time though, it feels good to keep doing what you are good at.  In that respect, I love repetition.  \u000a\u000a\u000aI am happy you find us ['fresh'.](http://i.imgur.com/DoJKR1t.gif)  
p6739
aVwhat's your favorite riff(s) to play? can be PTH or other.
p6740
aV"Always on The Run" - Lenny Kravitz, final answer.
p6741
aVWhat are your favorite places to go when you're on tour in Europe?
p6742
aVHey Luke! What song do you feel has been the hardest for the band to write or come together with? Not only based on technical aspects, but also on obstacles the likes of writer's block or something similar.
p6743
aVThere is always one song from every album writing session that is doomed from the beginning.  We are never happy with it, keep changing it, or keep trying to force some clunker riff/section in because we are clearly out of ideas.  That song usually gets scrapped.  But other times, we call it A Life Embossed.
p6744
aVDUDE so good! I know ya'll are touring all the time, any crazy stories from the road?
p6745
aVK this is Cam typing this one cause Luke is too lazy and this one's a doozy.\u000a\u000aSo we were in Belgium in June playing a festival, and our stage manager Henry/Hank hadn't been drinking for a month or two. There were a lot of his favorite bands playing that day, so I sat him down and said "Dude, much respect for going off the booze for a bit, but what's the point if you can't enjoy yourself? You're at a festival with a bunch of your favorite bands playing, fuckin have a beer or two." \u000a\u000aHenry eventually agreed with me, and succumbed to the booze that he deserves. We were each given about a 24 of drink tickets each for the day, so he was well prepared for the onslaught.\u000a\u000aSkip to the end of the night, it was 2am and bus call for us. We all stumble on, Henry passes out in his bunk around 2:30am, we all pass out eventually around 4/4:30.\u000a\u000a\u000aNext morning, our tour manager is directing the driver through Munich, and decides to check his email (this is around noon the next day.) Then he says "Um, guys, I got an email from Henry at 6am. There's no body to the message, and the subject simply says "Lost"."\u000a\u000aWe checked the entire bus, all the bunks, the driver's bunk. We had officially lost a crew member somewhere in Europe.\u000a\u000aLong story short, he somehow woke up in Holland still wasted with puke in his boxers, his phone was gone, he was berated by German cops, took 6 trains (he missed his stop twice cause he kept passing out) and eventually made it back to us the next day at 11pm.\u000a\u000aThere's more to this story but it's an awful lot to type out with the amount of beer in my system.
p6746
aVHenry = Henry Selva?
p6747
aVYes. The dude from THA
p6748
aVSorry man, Rody tells this one better.
p6749
aVThis is Cam.\u000a\u000aYou shut your entire hole.
p6750
aVThe whole hole?
p6751
aVFucking amazing. 
p6752
aVHow is Moe these days? Is he happy being(or possibly done) with school? \u000a\u000aAlso, have you heard The Double Cuts? Brilliant group, I think!\u000a\u000aAlso thanks for having me and my brothers on your bus in Austin last year for my birthday. That was the highlight of my year hanging with yall and TSF!
p6753
aVMoe is good as far as I know.  We keep trying to get together because I rent a desk at an office right beside where he works.  It's pretty shameful we haven't succeeded yet.  I will ask him when I see him though.\u000a\u000a\u000aYes, I have heard the double cuts and agree.\u000a\u000a\u000aNo problem - you guys were fun to chill with.  I wish I could have kept up with your rate of consumption.
p6754
aVHey Luke, massive fan here, saw you guys on the 27th of December and in August at the Moustache Club and the shows were amazing!  The music you guys make has pulled me from some really bad places and it always makes my day better!\u000a\u000aMy question is what if your favourite venue to play at?  Also do you notice a difference between hometown crowds and others?\u000a\u000aThanks again for the awesome music!
p6755
aVVenue: Danforth music hall was a pretty special one to crank off the list.  It has been there since 1919...in Canada, that's old.\u000a\u000a\u000aDefinitely notice a difference between hometown crowds and elsewhere.  We will never take our fellow Torontonians for granted.  This is the place we started and will be the place it ends.
p6756
aVHave you guys ever considered having Jadea Kelly join the band full time? I absolutely love every time she's contributed to your records!
p6757
aVJadea has her own amazing and unique career.  Despite her fitting in with us losers perfectly, we could never ask that.  We think it's just cool our paths cross continuously.
p6758
aVHey Luke, saw you in Edinburgh, Scotland recently. You hurt your hand during drumhead trial so hope you were ok, song kinda suffered though haha.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I would love you guys to do some covers or even a full album of them, it's been done before I know, so would that be a thing you would consider?
p6759
aVSounds like me "hurting my hand" was some sort of non-verbal way of making an excuse.  That song is ridiculous and I know it has suffered from time to time.  \u000a\u000a\u000aWe would love to do a set where we cover one of our favourite albums (collectively) but just haven't gotten around to it yet.
p6760
aVWhat are some things you like to listen to that don't sound like Protest at all? If anything ever happened to the band, would you continuing writing and would it be something drastically different from what you do now? \u000a\u000aThank man!
p6761
aVI listen to a lot of soundtrack stuff, movie scores etc. The progressions involved are always ear candy for inspiration.\u000a\u000aI hope I would continue writing if the band broke up, but it would sound exactly the same.
p6762
aVHey Luke I am big fan of Protest the Hero and your guitar playing! I was wondering what is your approach to mastering some of the tricky riffs on volition? like the one in drumhead trial where you and Tim are both playing two different riffs with lots of half and sixteen note rests.
p6763
aVThe call and answer stuff is often my favorite. I do think however that we went too far with that section in Drumhead. The back half is almost impossible to play in time if you're honoring the album version entirely. 
p6764
aVHow was your experience filming the divine suicide of K video?
p6765
aVTo be honest it was a nightmare.\u000a\u000aThat video was written, produced, and edited without our true input.  We felt strange on set, and even worse once we saw the final product. It's hard to believe now that no one stood up and said "this isn't what we want..." but no one did.  It was a milestone in our young days as proof of that saying "If you want it done right, do it yourself".\u000a\u000aThere is a reason you will never see us promote that monstrosity.
p6766
aVHave you guys considered using 7 string guitars at any point?
p6767
aVHey luke, did you guys ever play Skies live ?
p6768
aVnot yet.  we will though - something about using a capo live scares me.  I am a pussy though.  one day.
p6769
aVReally ? I thought I saw you using one during Sequoia Throne in Calgary 
p6770
aVHairband to mute the strings
p6771
aVThis guy watched the Sequoia Throne lesson
p6772
aVHow important is it for you to have great FOH/TM/Tech's working with you on the road?\u000a\u000aExamples. Capps and Hank.
p6773
aVVery important.  Both those guys are the best - it's going to be hard going on the road in the future without them (I think they may both be retiring).\u000aThey are my brothers.
p6774
aVHey Luke, hope you're doing well. When you're writing, how do you match tones to the riffs written, do you always start with a base tone and expand from there or do you start fresh?
p6775
aVThis last album, we left that up to the dudes recording it, Cam, Juice, and Aaron from Intervals (who helped us with tone stuff).\u000aSure, we chimed in when we liked a tone, but left it up to them to make most of the big decisions.
p6776
aVHey... so.. what are the colours of the limited edition record presses you're doing? Also, how has it been not being signed to a label? Everything I've seen has been ambiguous about the difficulty of setting everything up yourselves instead of relying on others. Do you prefer it this way or would you ever consider going back?
p6777
aVThose are going to be decided tomorrow - I am excited and have a lot of ideas, but it might be cool to poll people through our facebook or something to give suggestions.  People think their suggestions don't have an impact on the decision, but they really do.  \u000a\u000a\u000aIt has been amazing without a full blown label behind us - we still have distribution deals in place and definitely appreciate the guidance we get from said labels.  The difference is we are pretty free to follow or not follow that guidance.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt's a roll of the dice about which route is better, but we love gambling.
p6778
aVDid you know that your drummer can't even play Hot For Teacher?\u000a\u000aLove you Mike...\u000aTop of the World
p6779
aVCan I have a free pair of shoes if I hype you guys on here?
p6780
aVDo you play acoustic at all? What's your favorite acoustic that you own?
p6781
aVNot really.  I had a Parker acoustic but had to sell it.  Arif would have been relieved.  He thought it was the ugliest thing he had ever seen.
p6782
aVHey Luke. Love you guys and seen you all numerous times. What is the most complex guitar riff that you play live?
p6783
aVWe don't play it live much any more but the beginning octave displacement riff in Spoils is a frightmare.
p6784
aVYes it fucking is.
p6785
aVIt makes me happy to hear that because I know exactly the part you're talking about and i have difficulty playing it fast too  :o)
p6786
aVHey Luke! Thanks for taking the time for this AMA! First off, you guys really played a kick-ass show here in Moncton, NB last year, hope to see you guys back here again sometime! \u000a\u000aSecond, do you see yourselves as a band revisiting the storytelling-type lyrics of Kezia or Fortress at any point in the future? (ex. Bone Marrow, Kezia) 
p6787
aVThanks!\u000aI hope we do revisit that kind of thing - but I don't know if we could do it better.  Arif put together and awesome set of lyrics.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, I can relate much more to Rody's lyrics which can often make the song more special to me as a whole.
p6788
aV&gt;I can relate much more to Rody's lyrics which can often make the song more special to me as a whole.  \u000a\u000aTotally understandable! Thanks for replying. Really looking forward to the new material.
p6789
aVWould you guys ever consider doing a Propagandhi cover of sorts? Would love to hear a Protest-esque take on one of their songs, especially since I guess your music has been quite influenced by them.\u000a\u000aAnyways, loved Volition, easily my favorite album yet.
p6790
aVWe would all love to do it - but I have a feeling the P fellers would hate us for it.  Those songs are as good as they are going to get, we would butcher it I think.
p6791
aVHi Luke:) What's your favorite book?
p6792
aVNo brainer:\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/lg5pxKA.jpg
p6793
aVCould you explain the album art for volition? Why the vulture? 
p6794
aVWe sent Jeff Jordan the lyrics and a couple demos from the album asking him to interpret it. He liked some of the themes of interpretation in the media and elsewhere. He came up with the "Media Vulture" and we loved it. \u000a\u000aIt felt good to leave it in Jeff's hands.\u000a\u000aGoogle "Lida and the Swan" and check out the wiki. I think it was Jeff's main motivation. 
p6795
aVIf you haven't seen it, [this](http://www.stereokiller.com/newsreviews/newsimage/original/Untitled2.jpg) is the full album art. I assume the other one is mostly so they can have a cover without some chicks tits hanging out
p6796
aVHey Luke! My question is what album was the most fun to record? PS. I will gladly donate if you decide to crowdfund your next album :) 
p6797
aVHands down it was Scurrilous.  We lived on an aboriginal reserve (the studio has two apartments they offered to people recording).  Although it was still a couple hours drive from home, it was the most remote place we have recorded.  I still look back on those days and get goosebumps sometimes.  Positive energy and an unbridled enthusiasm for the future.  Wont forget that one.
p6798
aVHey, Luke, saw you and the band for the first time last November in Czech Republic, traveled ~3k km (both directions though) just to see you guys and I'm totally satisfied with everything. I'm still processing that I saw you live, since you're my favourite band at the moment, even though i wear my snapback every single day since then :D No question, just greetings from the small country of Bulgaria, hope to see you and the guys ASAP! Cheers!
p6799
aVHey Luke! What was the inspiration behind the song "skies?"...one of my favorites off of volition.  keep up the awesome work!
p6800
aVIf you're asking about the lyrics, you'll have to wait for Choady's AMA.\u000a\u000aIf you're asking about the music, we started off by trying to do something different (hence the capo and clean guitar intro/outro).\u000a\u000aWe felt it was an awesome way to end the album because there was something suggestive about that song which hints at where we're going in the future. 
p6801
aVHey Luke! I'm a huge fan, you guys rock my dick off. \u000a\u000aJust one question: how do you guitar like you guitar? \u000a\u000aThank you, \u000a\u000aDickless Fan
p6802
aVHey Luke, a couple of Q's for you!  \u000aWhat are your primary warm ups on your guitar?\u000aAnd also do you know when the Anthology pack on sheethappens will be available next?  Im very interested in purchasing that but its out of stock :(
p6803
aVHello, first of all I'd like to say that going to see protest the hero last December in Houston was probably one of the best shows I'd been to.\u000aAs for questions\u000a\u000a1)How long does it take for you to come up with the increasingly technical sections/leads in songs? An example being the "Plant the Seed" guitar lead in Drumhead Trial or something along those lines.\u000a\u000a2)Any plans for a signature guitar or pick ups in the future?\u000a\u000a3)Also, As someone who owns the volition tab book, would there ever be a possibility of official GP files?\u000a\u000aThanks!
p6804
aV3) We are going to start to offer GP files this year.  We will be doing that in the face of theft though.  A GP file is like 9kb and shared instantly.  We aren't convinced people will actually pay for it when they know they can get it for nothing.  We are still going to do it though - because we both agree there is nothing like learning from a GP file.
p6805
aVWhat about Brazil? Last time you guys came here I didn't have the resources to see the show. Yeah, sad thing.\u000a\u000aWas the experience good, to the point of coming back here? I'm really looking forward to it :)\u000a\u000aOne more question: I've never seen any video of PTH covering any song. Am I missing something there? 
p6806
aVYou guys should sell a digital tab book with the album. Albums come with lyrics, why not music notes?  Sidenote:  The new album is the shreadyist yet. 
p6807
aVWe have thought about that - it's a great idea.  Maybe we can offer that as a pack for the new album.  If you don't want the music score with it, you should have the choice not to ever see that mess of notes right?
p6808
aVNope, should be mandatory.  You have to acapella your favorite lick to buy the albums as well.  
p6809
aVHey Luke, love what you do in Protest. Just a simple question from me, what is your favorite song to play live?
p6810
aVMost of them are a nightmare to play live haha. I personally like when we randomly bust out a cover (which is usually Linoleum).   but if I had to pick one of our songs, I would say Mist.
p6811
aVIm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wants to be a newfoundlander too now. I wonder if they will thank you for the influx of visitors in the coming years :D
p6812
aVAnd the funnest to be a part of, Mist. 
p6813
aV[deleted]
p6814
aVHey Luke, thanks for creating some of my favorite music. Any plans to tour in the Philadelphia area soon? My brother and I have not missed a show you guys have had here in ages!!!
p6815
aVthanks fella!  Phili will always be on the map while doing a major market US tour.  I love ending a tour in that city - always an amazing show to go out on.  And it doesn't get much better than the Troc to me!
p6816
aVHey Luke, you and Tim have been a huge influence and inspiration on my guitar playing. The riffs and chord progressions/shapes you guys use are incredibly unique. How do you normally go about writing a song? Where do your ideas come from?\u000a\u000aThanks!
p6817
aVI usually start with a verse.  I like em to be fast and riffy but without interfearing with the vocals.  It's my comfort zone, so starting with that is usually my gateway into a song.  We used to try and write chronologically - make sure we start with the intro, move to the verse, etc.  I don't think that's a very open minded way of approaching music for me now a days.  I like to write out a bunch of parts and then let them come together in my mind over a period of time.  I start to hum it one way in the shower and at some point, I can't 'unhum' it.  That's when I know it has to go that way.
p6818
aVHey Luke! First of all thank you for your nice Riffing, Licking, Sweeping etc. - you are one of my favorite guitar player. \u000aTo my questions: \u000aWhat are techniques you are currently working on or try to get better? \u000aWhat is your songwriting routine? 
p6819
aVI have gone over quite a bit of songwriting stuff so just going to grab the first part of your question.\u000a\u000a\u000aI am currently working on getting better at chicken picking / hybrid picking.  It's insane to hear what people can do with the technique and I have always wanted to utilize it more.  Hopefully you will hear how I have progressed in the new tunes.
p6820
aVThanks for the answer! I'm looking forward to it.
p6821
aVBeen a fan for years ever since my guitar teacher first introduced me to The Dissentience. Took part in the crowdfunding on the last album and hope to again someday if you choose to do it again. \u000a\u000aNow, question time. If you guys could cover any song, what would it be and why?  
p6822
aVExtreme - Anything from III sides to every story.
p6823
aVI can definitely see you guys doing an amazing version of Warheads.  Thanks for the reply!
p6824
aV[deleted]
p6825
aVHey Truke, long time fan.\u000a\u000aI was wondering if you have any tattoos, or tattoo stories?
p6826
aVNo tattoos.  I watched Arif's eyes roll back in his head the first time he got a tattoo.  It really made an impact on me. 
p6827
aVAre you guys touring Canada? Come to sudbury again! 
p6828
aVOur last Sudbury show was a bit of a stinker.  Can you tell your friends!?
p6829
aVNot a question, just wanted to say that Volition is one of my all time favorite albums.
p6830
aVShoutout to a fellow metal head and disc golfer!!
p6831
aVHaha hell yeah!
p6832
aVWe appreciate that - here's hoping we can top it on the next one for you.
p6833
aVHello! I just wanted to say I'm a Volition backer (my name is somewhere in the vinyl :D) and I loved every step you guys took during that funding campaign. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
p6834
aVThanks a lot.  We appreciate every single person who contributed.  I hope we can do it again in the future.
p6835
aVSaw you guys live in Little Rock last year and just wanted to say you guys threw one hell of a concert and thanks for signing my copy of Volition on vinyl and cd! 
p6836
aVthanks and no problem.  Charming city.
p6837
aVLuke,\u000aPTH has been my favorite band for nearly 8 years now. Thank you for all the amazing music.\u000a\u000aThat being said, would you rather always feel like you have to poop? Or always have a slight headache? 
p6838
aVI have one of these conditions.  It's confusing.
p6839
aVHey Luke, I am a huge fan of your music! My question is what tips do you have for increasing picking speed? When I do some of the runs from your songs, like the end of Bloodmeat, I tend to sacrifice cleanliness for the speed. 
p6840
aVI had the same issue (and still do).  Because my picking hand was sluggish at times, I decided to focus on getting my legato flying!  I use that to fill in the notes I can't cleanly pick.  Look up some of the masters of picking though - Paul Gilbert being a monster.  He gives tons of advice on speeding up your right hand and breaks down exactly what you need to hear.  I wouldn't be anything without his advice and ability to TEACH me properly.
p6841
aVHey Luke, you and Tim are perfect. Actually perfect, as in without any sense of flaw. You are a huge influnce on me as a guitarist.\u000aIs there any particular excersise, song, or scale that you find really fun to practice, something expansive? Thanks based Luke.
p6842
aVGuilty, as charged.\u000aBut seriously, Tim and I have been trying to play Technical Difficulties up to speed for our entire lives.  Still...no dice.
p6843
aVHey Luke, the next time you guys play a show in Indiana, I'll buy your beer for the night. What do you guys like to drink?
p6844
aVThat would be lovely, but only if you buy one for Bobbo from the contortionist too - provided he is not on tour and cares to come out to the show.
p6845
aVAny potential for another concept album in the future?  Also, I think it would be pretty sweet if you guys could make a full tour with Unearth and Intervals.
p6846
aVWe have toured with both of those bands, but separately.  I agree that a tour with all three of us would be magical.  \u000a\u000a\u000aThere is always potential for conceptual stuff, it just depends how far we want to take it.  Musically, we are always thinking of sneaking in conceptual ideas.
p6847
aVHow much did Chris Adler contribute creatively? Did he just show up and play the parts or did he write the record with you guys?
p6848
aVHe contributed big time.  We hashed out ideas with him and gave him free reign to do what he wanted.  He is a big reason the album turned out so great.  Tim and I had a great time jamming and laughing with him for two weeks before we hit the studio.  I remember he would be in there before us and leave hours after we did....on a shitty old bike tim leant him.  It was March in Toronto, so not ideal bike weather hahah
p6849
aVWhat would be your main advice to a band just starting to jam together, just starting to hit the road to tour and a band just releasing their own first album?\u000a\u000aI realise this requires three answers but even if you only answer one that'd be awesome. Big fan, keep up the dope shredding!
p6850
aVI would try to tell them the importance of learning as you go.  As a young one, a big portion of our band (myself included) just drifted through the motions.  Let others figure stuff out for us (manager, label, circus clown, etc).  If we had have taken the time to understand each step, I wouldn't have had to go back and learn it all ten years later.  By all means, let people HELP you!  But don't let anyone but yourself sit in the driver's seat.
p6851
aVThanks man, that is actually a problem we're facing atm when trying to decide how to focus our time and who we can trust little tasks to. It's not on the same scale but I guess we've all had those moments where we wished the guy organising the gig and selling tickets was someone a little less incompetent!\u000a\u000aCheeky follow up question: As fans nowadays will always torrent an album before seeing a band live, in your opinion is being able to control your own sound/output the way you want more or less important than being in control of your stage/live show?\u000aI guess I'm asking who's better to leave to do their own thing, if need be, a producer or a tour manager?
p6852
aVNeither.  Make sure you love and trust both of those magnificent bastards.
p6853
aVaha, I'll keep this in mind man, thanks for going above and beyond for your fans again, it's a big inspiration for people like me and the other musicians here.
p6854
aVHey luke, what is your favourite flavour of doritos?
p6855
aVI haven't tried those ones where you play roulette with 1 out of 6 spicy doritos (or something like that).\u000aI think that was an underrated and hilarious idea from a marketing stand point.  I hope those chips were hot as fuck.
p6856
aVedit: cam just informed me you can do this at some pizza places.  We are going to do that right now.
p6857
aVWhy not just have Yimmy do it?
p6858
aVDo you remember tea bag kid from your Glasgow show a couple of years back? It was the end of blood meat and Rody rode his face and if so, do you have anything to say to him? I'll let him know when I see him in about an hour :P
p6859
aVI don't remember this specifically, but it reminded me of something else.  We used to travel around with pepper spray - don't know how we acquired it.  I remember we somehow convinced a guy at a show to spray some in his butt.  He did, and it was amazing - praise that guy.
p6860
aVHello Luke!\u000a\u000aI've been a fan of PTH since the Kezia days, but what made me fall in love with the band was Fortress which is still my favorite &lt;3\u000a\u000aWhen Scurrilous came out, it wasn't a concept album anymore (boo D:) and it sounded more vocal-centered. This was amped up even more on Volition, where Rody fucking nails it in every song. How was this shift of musicality within the band? What is the creation process of PTH?\u000a\u000aExtra question, from my heart: Will Arif write lyrics again? &lt;3\u000a\u000aThanks for doing this!
p6861
aVKezia was our only true concept album.  Fortress had some vague concepts, but I would never call it a concept album.  It is amazing to see how many people on here love the conceptual stuff - I do too, but it seemed like everyone started doing it, or pretending that their release was some deep, conceptual work.  We tend to step away from stuff if we think it's getting trendy.  It wasn't something we all sat down and discussed, the change happened naturally.  Maybe we will go back that route when everyone and their step brother stop trying to do it?
p6862
aVHey Luke, what's the makeup of your rig these days?? Walk us through the signal path!
p6863
aVShe is pretty simple now.  Tim and I have an 8 space rack.  Contents of said rack are 2 axe fx unite, a poweramp (which we constantly change), power converter, and tim has a wireless unit.  We run those to front of house (di signal) and also run them through cabinets on stage.  That's pretty much it!  We don't endorse any of our amp products on stage.  The only product I fully endorse are Ibanez geets. 
p6864
aVEver mess around with a Kemper? 
p6865
aVConsidering how technically demanding your music is, have you ever gotten injured playing guitar? If not, what do you do to prevent injury and keep your hands/forearms healthy?
p6866
aV/r/nsfw 
p6867
aVIn heindsight, I feel like this deserves a less joke answer.  I have never had a blatant injury in which I had to stop playing or something like that.  I have had muscle and joint pain while playing guitar which definitely affects my playing.  This is generally if I don't stretch or warm up enough.  And sometimes if I have warmed up TOO much.  That's the worst because I am sore before we even start!\u000a\u000a\u000aWe used to use these little warmup devices from d'addario.  The will apparently do wonders for your forearms but we pretty much used them because they were hilarious.  I would encourage you to try one out though.  Once you get the hang of it (takes some time - tim still can't do it on his own) you feel some muscles in there you didn't even know where in there.\u000a\u000a[Check it out Here](http://www.planetwaves.com/pwProductDetail.Page?ActiveID=4115&amp;productid=509&amp;productname=Dynaflex)
p6868
aVWill you go back to doing another concept album, I really enjoyed the subjects that were visited and the the way the songs were brought together?
p6869
aVHey There, I answered this question a bunch so am not going to reiterate again.  Just wanted to make sure you didn't think I was ignoring your post.
p6870
aVOther than your own, are there any albums that I absolutely must get right now if I haven't done so already? 
p6871
aVExtreme - III sides to every story
p6872
aVHey Luke,\u000a\u000aA lot of your stuff seems based in 4/4 with a lot of variation within the actual songs (what i mean is, usually your songs are established as 4/4 and then will sneak some off-time measures in there). Do you find it difficult to count sometimes while on stage, especially since, in a live setting, there is typically a bit more room for improv/not playing the "written" part?\u000a\u000aThanks for doing this!
p6873
aV4/4 is always going to be the comfort zone for me.  Really stuff that's close to it as well, 7/8 being my favourite, but now a days used quite often.  Us guys in the band will generally count stuff differently - it's rare that I feel myself counting in my head, although I try to keep my foot tapping as often as I possibly can.  Focussing on just that simple aspect made me a better player.  \u000a\u000a\u000aI have gotten lost on stage before and had to stop (pretty embarrassing), but that is usually do to the fact that my mind tends to wander when we are playing - especially if I am having a good time.  I start to think about battling my cat when I get home (we are at constant odds), or something equally unrelated to anything musical.  That's the long way of saying that I don't generally get into trouble with counting, nor do I feel the need to do it unless I am learning a new piece (5/4 gives me some trouble sometimes, don't know why hahah).   
p6874
aVAwesome, thanks so much for the comprehensive response!\u000a
p6875
aVYour album Kezia really hit a note with me when I first heard it and the more I listened to it and understood how it came to be written and the premise of the album I was really hooked on you guys. It's your only journey so far into a concept album with a key theme to it and I was wondering if you have any more ideas like this lined up, or is it like you mention in Dunsel:\u000a\u000a&gt; "The songs we sung when we were just young\u000a&gt; have all but lost their meaning"\u000a\u000aAlso Volition seemed to be a lot more about vocal hooks and lyrics than previous albums (although there are some absolute fantastic tunes on that album - Skies, Animal Bones), was this a conscious decision you made when writing or is this just the way you seem to be progressing as a band?
p6876
aVKezia was a great ride at the time - we really wanted to put something forward that got people talking.  We had no idea the reach it would have while writing it, nor did we dream that we would still be talking about it almost ten years later.  We are very glad you enjoyed it but at the moment have no concrete plans to dive into a concept that far again.  You have to remember the lyrics were written by a fellow who is no longer writing in the band.  If we did something else conceptual, it would certainly take on an entirely new feel and direction.  I am glad we did it, but don't think we would revisit those specific themes again.  Who knows though right?\u000a\u000a\u000aThe lyrical reference is something that you will have to ask Rody in his AMA.  He wrote that set and although that line certainly means something to me - it's an interpretation (just like you) and not necessarily what he was thinking.  It's the beautiful thing about lyrics no?\u000a\u000a\u000aI think we have settled down some in the chaos dept over the years and have found our role as a vocal-centric band.  Sure, we love to rip some riffs, but what sets us apart from other bands are the vocals.  Lots of guys emulate rody now a days, but I think he still does rody best.  We will continue to put an emphasis on the vocal lines and make sure melody and song craft is job #1
p6877
aVThanks for the great input and replying 2 days after the designated AMA! \u000a\u000aI do disagree with the vocals being what sets you apart. Your sound is a bit less niche than it was a few albums back but I think that's just how you've progressed and the result of losing two founding members. \u000a\u000aI think you could be an amazing band even without Rody. I'm probably thinking too far back from where your current mindset is but I think Fortress has been your most finely crafted 'PTH' sound all-round. Don't get me wrong, you know Rody when you hear him - what's really magical is knowing a Hoskin/Millar riff when you hear one as I feel it's much harder to create your own sound on a guitar than vocally.\u000a\u000aRegardless, I still love the music you're producing and ever since I first heard Blindfolds Aside when I was 13 I've been a huge fan. You're one of my inspirations on the guitar and I strive really hard to emulate your sound and be able to play your songs. Keep getting better so I can keep chasing.
p6878
aVHey Luke, thanks for the AMA! You guys are easily one of my favorite bands and I love all of your music videos. Do you guys create the concepts for them or do the directors come to you with them?
p6879
aVWe have done it both ways.  Sometimes, a director will approach us with an idea they have already thought through.  The "Heretics" video concept was something Marc Ricciardelli had always wanted to do.  We are generally up for anything (especially when we were younger) and loved the idea.  Even though it had next to nothing to do with the song itself, he created a video that people still talk about today!\u000a\u000a\u000aSometimes we will pitch an idea to a director.  For the Limb from Limb video, I was on a kick of watching village people vids - say what you want, they are hilarious.  I thought we could do a good job of recreating it.  We were just lucky Marc Andre took the idea on with so much enthusiasm and professionalism.\u000a\u000a\u000aOther times, we have been on tour and not had much say in a video *cough, divine suicide cough*.  Those are ones we are pretty ashamed of.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe way it tends to work now a days is marc ricc and I sit down over a couple beers and maybe a pizza...perhaps an appetizer if we're good and hungry, and start hashing out ideas.  Hair Trigger, Mist, and Underbite were all products of those conversations.  Very proud of them.
p6880
aVThanks so much for the detailed response! I'm really excited to eventually receive my re-release oh Kezia on vinyl!
p6881
aVI got the Volition song book a while ago, and its fantastic!  After ordering it, I found out that it was only tab and not tab and sheet music like the other song books.  Any plans to release a version with sheet music included?\u000a\u000aAlso what mystic river did you bathe in to gain the skill and power you have?
p6882
aVGlad you asked.  Leaving out the notation was a tough choice.  We ultimately decided that if we were going to be printing hundred of them (maybe even thousands), we should have some consideration for the amount of paper being used.  The standard notation just about doubles the amount of page space needed and we decided out main customer base were people who read tab.  I still think we are right about that, but I agree that we should offer the standard stuff for those go getters like yourself.  Look out for it in the future.\u000a\u000a\u000aI generally bathe in a river of beer and sometimes vodka when I have the chance.  It seems to keep the evil thoughts at bay ;)
p6883
aVFair enough, thanks for getting back to me!\u000aAlso I should have known booze is always the answer.  Silly me.\u000a
p6884
aVJust saying I would sell my soul for a Kezia rock opera
p6885
aVhaha - on the other hand you could develop one and then keep your soul?  ....didn't think so.
p6886
aVYo Luke, when you and PTH gonna be passing through Thunder Bay again? 
p6887
aVHard to say - TB is waaaay up there.  always a beautiful drive though.  As empty as the shows may be, I think we will all still enjoy playing there....and going to the casino.
p6888
aVDo you ever draw inspiration from albums that people wouldn't expect you to listen to? Also, what's your current jam? \u000a\u000aEdit: I've seen you guys live five times now, and you were the first band I hung out with backstage (this was the UK tour with Born Of Osiris quite a few years ago). Obviously this was when Moe and Arif were still in the band, but all of you guys were really cool and I'd just like to say thanks for being humble and all that lark. All the best!
p6889
aVProbably.  I often hear something on jazz or classical radio (91.1 for you gta people in the know) and want to know what was going on.  If I can safely do it, I grab shazam or make sure I listen to what it was.  Those genres are neat in that way, because looking up one tune might undercover dozens of renditions of the same song or standard.  I have definitely been surprised that simple ideas can often be the most mesmerizing and lasting.\u000a\u000a\u000aGlad we could meet you and make an impression.  I hope we gave you a beer or two.
p6890
aVFirst off, I just want to say thanks to you and your band for being the shit for so long. I've loved you guys since Kezia and my love got tripled when Yimmy gave me a signed copy of Volition in Dublin after I didn't get the CD sent out to me. Safe to say I died with happiness after that, probably the coolest thing ever.\u000a\u000aOne thing I've always wondered is where the line "grateful you die by Irish steel" in Limb from Limb came from? \u000a
p6891
aVI am glad we were able to make it up to you.  Because we were on tour when volition was released - we had to use a third party shipper for some of the perks.  Not blaming them, but some didn't make it - so many reasons that could have happened.  We just want to make sure everyone who didn't get their perk does.  It's going to be something we chip away at for a long time, but we will never forget.\u000a\u000a\u000aYou will have to ask Arif about the Irish Steel line.  I think I know / remember but don't want to sound like a dummy.  I guess I should have considered that before taking on 500 questions eh?
p6892
aVHi there Truke! A couple of questions. You already mentioned that you had just started the writing process. How much do you (the band itself) usually take from the "beginning" till the "end" (release of the final album)? I guess I can't wait. Aside from that, is Cam your full-time bass player now that Riff is gone or would you search for another player? Can't wait to see y'all again in Spain :D
p6893
aVThe time it takes always varies.  We want to try new ways of releasing music this time.  Although the plan is still to write our 5th full length album, it would be nice to release some single songs along the way (for pay what you can or something) just to keep things fresh.  It isn't often you have a band who are free to release whatever they want whenever they want without a label or manager intervening so we want to exploit that freedom.  Also, album versions of songs have been rethought and rehashed beyond belief by the time you guys hear them.  It might be cool to hear something less refined and raw from us.  Something that can stand on it's own and doesn't have to be a part of a giant opus!\u000a\u000a\u000aCam is like the fifth member / ghost now a days.  His true love is being a producer and mixing bands live.  Although he is a mean bass box, you have to respect when someone wants to do their first passion.  He is welcome as long as he wants to stay - but at some point that may involve finding a more permanent bass player, yes.
p6894
aVHey man, just wondering what song in the entire PTH catalogue took the longest to write - either because of the difficulty or structure, etc.?\u000a\u000aAs an aside, I met you guys in Halifax when you were touring through Canada for Fortress. You guys kicked ass both performance wise and as people! Which leads me to another question - how do you like Nova Scotia? 
p6895
aVThat's a tough quesiton because some of them were written so long ago.  I often find it's the first song we sit down to write for any given session.  I remember "Tandem" taking a light year.  It's one we have still never played live.  It is easily in my top 3 if not my favourite song we have written though.  \u000a\u000a\u000aLove Nova Scotia.  Want to travel to halifax and be able to be a tourist / not have to play a show some time.
p6896
aVHey Luke,  what kind of picks do you like?  Normal sized. .mm... ? 
p6897
aVI like Jazz III picks.  I have lots of friends / players in other bands who make fun of me for it though.  That have moved on to thinner picks - mainly because they are better than I on the instrument now!
p6898
aVWill you boys play Indiana soon? 
p6899
aVWe wont be playing anywhere soon for quite some time.  We try to hit them all eventually though!
p6900
aVHey Luke, the last time I saw you guys live in DC Rody got all fired up after someone asked about A Life Embossed. It definatly pushed the show from good to great since Rody and everyone else seemed more pumped after Rody's rant. \u000a\u000aIs there something specific to you that fires you up during a show? Playing a certain song? or seeing something in the crowd?
p6901
aVDepends how you define "fired up"...\u000a\u000aIf you mean like excited fired-up?  I would say when people are having a genuinely wonderful time and not just standing there scared cause it's a monday night and they have to work the next day\u000a\u000aIf you mean really angry fired-up? I would say it's when some asshole thinks we give a fuck about what they yell at us in between songs.  More so if they think anyone in the building gives a fuck.\u000a\u000aOur shows are meant to be an open forum - if you have a great one liner or just want to hear a song - we get that all the time and generally will join you for a laugh.  It's the drunken repeat offenders who we would rather boot fuck out of the show and be happy they hate our band forever afterwards.
p6902
aVI meant excited fired-up. I think it's really cool that you guys' shows are like an open forum. It's definitely a unique experience and one of the reasons I ceaselessly talk up PtH.\u000a\u000aYou guys have seriously changed the way I look at music and writing. Your music really helped me find myself as a musician. I am eternally thankful for that. 
p6903
aVAppreciate it.  Godspeed with everything.
p6904
aVIf you could choose to be one of The Avengers, why would you pick Iron Man?
p6905
aVCause he is the only one that doesn't kind of suck?
p6906
aVWhat music is most listened to on the road? Do you guys do stuff as a group outside of playing and writing music while out of town?\u000a\u000aPlease crowd fund another album, I'd rather give you my money than Sony, and play in Hamilton more.
p6907
aVWe tend to all use headphones on the road now.  The last thing you want to do is hear music all the time.  That rule is thrown out the window if there are drinks flying around though - put on whatever you want and let's act like fools.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn tour we branch off into groups usually.  There is the coffee crowd, the drinkin' buddies, and the tourists.  You can be none or all of the above at any given time though.\u000a\u000a\u000aI hope we do crowdfund the next album - but who knows at this point!\u000a\u000a\u000aWe are playing Hamilton on Feb 7th.  If you aren't there, I will be forced to disregard your suggestion in the future.
p6908
aVWhich of your guitars is your favorite? What kind of pickups do you use? Have you ever had any talks with ibanez about an endorsement? And how are you liking the jump to Axe fx. \u000a\u000aThanks for being one of the most creative guitar players and song writers! I'm looking forward to hearing the new album. 
p6909
aVI mainly have Ibanez geets these days - they are my favourite and I endorse em fully.  Don't know which is my favourite - but the LACS and J-customs tend to play themselves.  Can you bug Ibanez to make a signature model?  They will never listen to just me.\u000a\u000a\u000aAxe FX has been a cool change.  Miss tube amps but the axe just makes travelling a lot easier.
p6910
aVThanks for the reply! I was surprised to get one after so long. If I could make the call I would get you a sig! Do you notice a difference between LACS and J custom? Which do you prefer? 
p6911
aVI am going to be trolling these questions until I get to them all.  I know not everyone will see but it's important to me to make sure I give everyone some kind of response.\u000a\u000a\u000aThere is a big difference.  On one hand, you have the lacs stuff which is completely customized by me.  This is a great thing which I would never take for granted, but I am not some master luthier with tons of knowledge about guitar builds.  It's kind of guess and test as I go.  They turn out looking like works of art, but not sure everyone would love my wood choice, neck, bridge, yadda yadda.   I like to experiment and will always be looking for my perfect Ibanez axe I think.\u000a\u000a\u000aJ customs on the other hand are in my opinion the work of tons of years to perfect the highest end catalog models.  They truly are a treat to behold.  I would be smart to design my lacs models after the jcustoms I think.\u000a
p6912
aVHey Luke, I've seen you guys play a bunch of times throughout the years and you fucking rock. I was wondering, do you remember playing a tiny impromptu set at club Ansinthe in Hamilton around the time Fortress was coming out? I was at the bar with Dan Fila (he was my buddy's music teacher) and we loved it. You guys were drunk as fuck but I think it may have been the first time Bloodmeat was played? Anyways keep writing awesome shit man
p6913
aVI have nightmares about that "impropmtu set" - I remember not knowing how to the hold the guitar that's how boozed I was.  I tried so hard to get out of that bbut remember Juice looking at me and saying "pooky, there is no way you are getting out of this" and then he threw me up on stage.  what a night!\u000aTell Dan we say hi!
p6914
aVHi luke. I Just wnna know : since protest is a big famous band... Whats your opinion about te music industry in these days?? I mean, do you prefer been an indepent band, check for yourself all these booking stuff and merch? Or it has been a better deal with the record label (dont know the name of yours) i have a band, and we're about to start a tour. Saludos desde México. Hope some day we can light a joint together jaja
p6915
aVWe are enjoying being independent now but we wouldn't have gotten here without labels.  Now a days, bands can take a serious run at a career on their own (if they are good).  Just take the time to learn all the steps as you go because when you are independent one day, you will be ready to start pwning everything on your own.
p6916
aVWow! Thank you luke! I was so happy when i saw you answer. We're doing our best to go on and on. Hope some day we can share rock stage! thanks for your time. 
p6917
aVHey Luke, \u000a\u000aJust a question from a huge fan from the GTA:\u000a\u000aI saw you guys at the Danforth Music Hall last month and was pretty hyped at seeing Jadea and Kayla joining you on stage. What are the chances that you guys could get Moe and Arif back for a song or two (or, y'know, a whole night)? \u000a\u000a(No disrespect to Cam or Mike, either, its just that 8/10 times I've seen you, it was the original lineup (with Cam working merch) and I think it'd be cool to see the same 5 guys I saw in like '08 or '09 play through Blinfolds Aside)
p6918
aVI think it might be to fresh and recent to drag those guys back up on stage.  We kicked around the idea of having both those guys come back for a song but I think the divorce is still too new.  I don't mean a yucky divorce either - it was amicable and the right way to go for everyone.  Maybe one day.\u000a\u000a\u000aJadea and Kayla did a smash up job just like we knew they would.  I remember Kayla showed up after sound check and we asked her if she wanted to rehearse her section.  She laughed at us and grabbed a beer.
p6919
aVwhen are you guys coming back to toronto!!! 
p6920
aVwe live in toronto!  I am sure we'll see you around.
p6921
aVHey Luke, reinforce my opinions here\u000aKezia &gt; Fortress &gt; Volition &gt; Scurrilous (they're all great, but you gotta rank em)
p6922
aVScurrilous&gt;Volition&gt;Fortress&gt;Kezia\u000a\u000aKezia is a potpourri of mindless noodling and overplaying.  Can't believe anyone still enjoys it hahah.  \u000a\u000aBut seriously, definitely the weakest album from a "musician's" standpoint.
p6923
aVlol literally the opposite, ouch. 
p6924
aVI like the noodling, plus it was some of rodys best singing (at least for what I like), plus the great story
p6925
aVWhen are you guys gonna do reprints of past merch? I bought one of your shirts, the turquoise one covered in lude sex acts, lost it, and have been searching for it since. Please let me know as it was my least favorite shirt fuck you.
p6926
aVThat shirt was the best.  I am sure I can dig up the print file if you wanna create a one off for yourself?
p6927
aVThat would be fucking amazing!! Used to wear that shirt to school, nobody ever noticed just how graphic was until I pointed it out. Even teachers, haha.
p6928
aVI will have a dig.  No promises though. 
p6929
aVHey Luke! I have participated in the crowdfunding to make "Volition" come true. I got a really kickass shirt and holy shit, the music is just amazing. \u000aAll the attention you had during the campaign to the fans were just incredible.\u000aI don't have anything to ask really, bit I wanna thank you and the band for making the music I love!\u000a\u000aOh right, any chance of coming to play in Brazil?\u000a\u000a
p6930
aVThank you for your support.  It means the world to us.    I hope we can continue to impress you somehow.\u000a\u000aBrazil in 2015 would be an amazing thing - here's to hoping it pans out.
p6931
aVHey Luke, \u000aI am not trying to ask you to step on anyone's toes, but who is your favorite band to tour with?
p6932
aVI honestly have enjoyed the company of 95% of the bands who we have been lucky enough to tour with.  We have a special bond with the Safety Fire since they never seem to fuck off from every tour we ever do.  Seriously amazing people and proud to call em my friends.  Noiche ye!
p6933
aVI've noticed that almost before every song you play live you practice a riff from it with the volume off right before starting. Is it like a nerve/OCD thing?
p6934
aVshit!  you noticed that eh?\u000aI think it's so I don't confuse it with another riff.  Some of our songs start similarly - If you ask Rody, he will tell you they are all the same from start to finish.  I just do it to jog my memory - but it could have become an ocd thing over the years too.  
p6935
aVHey luke can you and tim come give me a guitar lesson. I bought your volition tab book at the toronto show and its challenging. So yeah bring everyone over. No drugs/alcohol though and mandatory prayers/bible readings every hour on the hour got it?
p6936
aVOkay.  So condoms or no condoms?
p6937
aVHey Luke,\u000aAny of you guys game?
p6938
aVVideo games, not really.  Although gta5 calls out to me all the time.  I have to fight picking up the controller.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you are referring to the online dating scene as a "game", just look at us and you'll know.
p6939
aVCan you guys make a full-band version of Chody's Pro-Smoking-Cigarettes song?
p6940
aVAt this point, the guy has to hate that song with a fiery passion.  Everywhere he goes one or two people yell it at him or bust out acoustic guitars and play it....the whole way through.  If he paid me enough, I would learn it.
p6941
aVHey Luke, love PTH, the St. John's show of the Newfoundland tour was the best concert I've ever been to. Any chance of coming back to the island soon?
p6942
aVThat one really was special for all of us I think.  Loved the projection images behind us when I got a chance to glance around.  I don't know when we will be back, but it would certainly be cool to get there again within this year!
p6943
aVMan, having both PTH, and great movies at the same time was so great!
p6944
aVAyy Luke! \u000a\u000aDo you know the pressing colors for the coming repress of your albums? Grabbed a copy of Fortress last time, it sounds great!
p6945
aVI do know the colours yes.  But I don't want to give them away yet.  We kept is classy for Kezia, got quite splattery with fortress, and went all out weird on scurrilous.  I can't wait to see them.
p6946
aVSeen you guys play Scotland and a few England festivals now, you blow the roof off every time.\u000a\u000aWhat's your favorite part about Scotland or coming to the UK in general?
p6947
aVMy favourite part about scotland is an actual guy named Scott who does our merch for us.  Aside from being a great person, hilarious fella, and insane drinker...he treats his job so professionally while remembering to always treat people at the show with respect.  That's something merch guys don't always care about.\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso - our shows in scotland are almost always a blast!
p6948
aVYeah the merch guy in vancover last trip through was a fucking dick. Seriously he should eat shite sandwiches
p6949
aVHey Luke,  \u000a\u000aJust a real quick question for ya. Why do you love Newfoundland so much? I am trying to plan a trip out to the maritimes this year and the level of interest the band shows for Newfoundland has always intrigued me. BTW you guys rock and if I do go out there I'll definitely be listening to mist while we enjoy the beautiful scenery. 
p6950
aVIt's probably one of those places you just have to go and experience before you get it.  Nicest people, best albeit very small downtown area.  The ocean, the wildlife, the scenery, the food.  It never ends.
p6951
aVHow do you feel about Billy Talent? :D
p6952
aVI think they are great.  Found a nice niche between mainstream music and keeping their integrity.  I can't think of another band that sounds quite like em.  
p6953
aVSooo.....what's up with the fear of nightly bees?
p6954
aVhaha I answered this earlier and it was pretty long winded.  Try scrolling up a couple hundred questions and you should find it.
p6955
aVHey Luke! How many hours a day worth of practice would you recommend? 
p6956
aVI used to practice a lot.  Working on technique and what have you.  Now a days when I pick up a guitar, it's generally time to write stuff.  I gotta be honest, it's more fun than practicing.  On tour though, I warm up and practice monotonous stuff a lot.  It keeps me sane.\u000aNumber of hours = how ever much you think it takes to really improve on something...anything...even just a little.
p6957
aVJust wanted to say it was a real honour to meet you at the Hard Rock Cafe in Toronto and have you watch my band play. You are one of my biggest idols. Keep up the good work. -Andrew of MLFH
p6958
aVHey Fella, \u000aIt was cool for me too - it was such a random drop in for me and it was a nice surprise to watch you guys and have free drinks somehow.  I really enjoyed it - hope you are still doing your thing.
p6959
aVHey Luke! Pretty nice of you to pop in for an AMA. \u000a\u000aI've been a huge fan for quite a while and you guys have a very special place deep down in my heart...I remember that the very first metal show that I have attended was a tour that you did with Between the Buried and Me, Killswitch Engage and In Flames. At that show, I bought 3 Protest the Hero shirts because PTH designs were the most fabulous designs.\u000a\u000aNow on to the questions : \u000aIf you could play in any other bands, what would it be? \u000aDo you rather play inside a venue or outside during a festival?\u000aWhat's your favorite band to tour with?\u000a\u000aOn a side note.. Does Rody still rips his shirt during shows? Every time I've seen you guys at a festival he rips his shirt. 
p6960
aVHey, thanks for grabbing those shirts - it's pretty much the main reason we can afford to keep playing.\u000a\u000a\u000aI would definitely want to play in something a little more held back.  Although I love playing in p-test, mainly because of it's challenges, it can becomes stressful over the course of a long tour.  It's a lot of notes to play (or fuck up) every nights and if you think about it too much, it can weigh on you.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe tighter and more intimate the venue, the better for me.  I love stages which are not elevated above the crowd.  Well maybe a little bit so that everyone can see, but not much.  Inside is definitely better for me.  Playing outside at a festival in the sun at 1:00 pm feels totally wrong!\u000a\u000a\u000aI can honestly say that 95% of the bands we have toured with have been amazing people - or in the 5%ers defence, the tour was too short or hectic to get to know each other.  Although I would have a tough time saying my absolute favourite, the bands we have toured with multiple times are generally my favourite because we have more time to hang out and get to know one another.

p6962
aVFrankly Luke, I miss seeing Riffs happy face on stage. Knowing one day he'll back playing with his pals would put me at ease.\u000aNo details this? \u000a\u000a&amp; also what's your favorite color?
p6963
aVColours: green and blue\u000a\u000a\u000aI miss seeing him out there too - but we played so many shows together I will never regret the time we both put in.  Sometimes, you have to do something that makes you happy - and often, once you have done something for so long, it's time for something new.  I have had an awesome outlet with Sheet Happens Publishing.  I am able to split my days between the two giant projects.  Arif's outlet was and is playing with other acts, doing plays, etc.  I am just glad we both have found outlets which are still creative and musical!
p6964
aVHow do you play the arpeggios in Bone Marrow so cleanly? I can't seem to get them no matter how much I practice.
p6965
aVthey are fast enough that you can't hear the mistakes my friend...
p6966
aVI saw you in Jacksonville, FL last year and it was incredible. My boyfriend's prog band is releasing their first album on Saturday, what tips can you give to them about finding success when just starting out? \u000a\u000aShameless plug: Look up Velocirapture, they're awesome.

aVIf you had to have sex with any of your band members (past/present) who would it be?
p6970
aVIt would be the band member who wrote this. \u000aChode maybe?
p6971
aVrody is /u/jrodyw
p6972
aVeach and everyone at the same time...but in a train.  and we pull numbers to see who's where.
p6973
aV7 years ago i purchased the same model ibanez as you had back in the day. S series 470. You had the green, and i saw you sold it and i missed out. Im a huge fan of yours and have been to more than 10 of your shows in toronto. Just wondering if you have plans on selling any of your other guitars in the future. It would mean the world to me to have a guitar used by you. Not going to lie, your the reason i picked up a guitar brother!
p6974
aVI only ever sell a beloved guitar if I really need the money.  It hurts me every time I need to do it.  However, I am hoping that one day I can sell one for someone or something who needs the money more than me.  I think I would feel a lot better about it for those reasons.  I hope you get one of those!
p6975
aVHey Luke, \u000a\u000a1. Would you guys ever consider re-recording some songs off of The Calculated Use of Sound? A few songs on there would sound amazing with the band's now more technical sound.\u000a\u000a2. Now that The Fall of Troy is back together doing some tours, might there be a chance that you and TFOT could do a tour together? *Please?*
p6976
aVWe have touched on the subject before.  It might be tough to make em that much more interesting and we would risk re doing them just to rip some hard solos here and there that we couldn't pull off back then hahaha.  (hard-solos is a great term)\u000a\u000a\u000aWe would all love to tour with TFOT again.
p6977
aVHoly shit, I didn't expect a reply. Thanks!\u000a\u000aI'll see you guys next time y'all come to Louisiana!
p6978
aVHey Luke, big fan of your guitar work. I've purchased all your books and learned every song. I play in a band and we sound a lot like protest, there's nothing I can do about it. I always wondered though, what band, philosophy,musician, or drug trip inspired you to write such difficult, nonsensical, awesome riffs on fortress. \u000aThanks
p6979
aVThe Fortress writing days were pretty focussed.  I and Rody lived in whitby at the time (with our parents), and I used to get up every morning pretty early and play guitar for 2-3 hrs before heading over to pick up rody.  Then we would listen to music on the trip into the city every day talking about what we could rip off (a lot of it from the radio haha).  We drank a lot of coffee, beer, and I remember a container of discarded cigarette butts which might fill a pool - but not too heavy on the drugs.  Those days were pretty open, we were just trying to do our own thing and blow our first album out of the sky.  I guess the philosophy was something like "anything is possible" as lame as that sounds.  There were no limitations or standards.  It was great.\u000a\u000a\u000aThank you for grabbing the books.  It means a lot.
p6980
aVHey Luke !!! I've been playing guitar for 7 years now...A question..I'm thinking about trying something new and picking up a cello to try and learn...any tips for someone learning a brand new instrument, also if you had to stop playing guitar what other instrument calls your name ? 
p6981
aVI thought about that too for a while (violin over cello), but it never happened.  I guess it would be something I might try if I couldn't play the geet anymore.  I have heard it's a frustrating / challenging road though - I would have been more hungry in my younger days!\u000aGod speed sir...
p6982
aVHey Luke, cheers from Israel!\u000aYou're by far my favorite band. any chance you'll be visiting Israel for a show anytime soon?\u000aWhat about a tour in Europe? planning one anytime soon?
p6983
aVWe did three tours in Europe for the Volition album cycle.  That is a lot for any band to do from North America.  \u000a\u000a\u000aWe would love to come to Israel to play a show - that's something arif was very vocal about doing.  We are pretty much down to play anywhere these days no matter how far away it is.  Hopefully we might see you there one day.
p6984
aVHey Luke,\u000a\u000aSaw you guys live in Halifax NS during Rock the Hill, was actually more pumped to see you guys than Metallica, it was a wicked show! \u000a\u000aI've been playing guitar for about 10 years now, and just recently started tackling your songs. I've watched video lessons that you and Tim did on Youtube and was just wondering in C'est La Vie during the verse, theres a lot of jumping around. How did you practice this? Just do it really slowly or is there a special technique you did to help you?\u000a\u000aThanks again, and can't wait for the next album! 
p6985
aVThat's awesome that you were there.  I remember playing as sideways rain was flying in our faces.  What a shot day for a show eh?  My favourite was being able to get everything off stage, crack a beer and watch Coheed play.  What a treat!\u000a\u000a\u000aIf my memory serves me, that verse is pretty scaler?  It's pretty much a harmonic minor scale haha!  It might jump around but is all based on octaves.  You got this brother and/or sister.
p6986
aV[deleted]
p6987
aVHey Luke, you write some awesome shit. couple questions though:\u000a\u000a1. how do you write guitar parts? do you take bits of chords and string them together or what? im a bassist looking for guitarists but id like to be able to write out guitar parts a little more.\u000a\u000a2. Favorite axe? \u000a\u000a3. How did the original PTH get together?\u000a\u000athanks for your time and keep doing what youre doing!
p6988
aVI answered the riff writing stuff quite a bit already.  But if you get Guitar Pro (6 is the latest version), it will help you with your writing.  You can even start with bass ideas and branch out into as many guitar tracks as you want.  It definitely helped me with everything and has for years.\u000a\u000a\u000aFav Axe: my Ibanez LACS models\u000a\u000a\u000aPth got together while in public school.  That is not a type we have been playing together since grade 8.  Frightening to think about!
p6989
aVGiven that your songs are progressive and almost nothing is repeated, when do you decide that a song is finished and doesn't need another riff or part added to it?
p6990
aVI think that was something we definitely focused on in the past.  Every part should be new, repeating a part is a "no-no".  That is definitely something that we have grown out of.  We still enjoy a progressive outlook on a song or album as a whole, but there is nothing wrong with repetition if it's a great part / riff.  Fear not, there is always going to be a song or two we really go for the progressive sound - they just take forever!
p6991
aVBlindfolds Aside or Limb From Limb?
p6992
aVLimb from Limb - that blatant Mastodon rip off riff is my favourite.
p6993
aVHey Luke. A couple of questions i forgot to ask at the Edinburgh M&amp;G if you wouldn't mind:\u000a\u000a1. How're you guys feeling about the reunion of SikTh? Think there might be potential for that UK tour together you missed out on years ago? \u000a2. How do you guys go about playing with the backing tracks live? Is it an ipod panned click track and the backing panned to the other side or something similar? I'm trying to figure out the best way to do the same thing for my band. \u000a\u000a`Michael

aVWho could be upset that Sikth is getting back together??  Not us!\u000aIt would be great to play a show, tour, or album cycle with them ahha - I think the shows would go over really well.\u000a\u000a\u000aPlaying with backing tracks has been a struggle for us to say the least.  None of us want to, but we feel we need to incorporate parts played by album guests if they cannot come with us.  I have no idea how they are triggered hahah - just a sampler I think.  Other bands use laptops, but that's for running some serious backing tracks with lots of stems / tracks.  We will never be that band.
p6995
aVHave you got any tours/shows around planned?\u000a\u000aPortugal would like to have you visit!\u000a
p6996
aVNo plans to head back to Portugal yet, but we all love it there.  I once vacationed after a tour there and it was amazing.  Maybe a little too young and stupid to make the best of it, but I hope I get a second chance!
p6997
aVThere's always hope! Glad you enjoyed yourself during your stay, wish you the best mate
p6998
aVWill you give me some of your guitar skills? I gots none. :'(
p6999
aVtrade me for a better hairline?
p7000
aVIs there any interest from you or the other band members to contribute more to the lyric writing process? It seemed like Rody had a lot of fun and got a lot of praise after taking over for Arif. \u000a
p7001
aVI don't think any of us want to mess with a good thing.  Although they come from completely different places, Rody and Arif are both great lyricists.  I can relate to Rody's a little more and therefor am very happy with our writing set up moving forward.
p7002
aVHey Luke! I'm curious, are we ever going to get bass tabs to the albums?
p7003
aVThe Volition Bass Book should be out in March (latest).  We are also doing a drum book for it.  And a complete score kind of thing for all you GP nerds out there.\u000a\u000a[Sheet Happens Publishing](http://sheethappenspublishing.com)	\u000a\u000aIt is harder to go back in time with the bass books because stems are hard to come by, and trust me, our memories fade faster than you can say....
p7004
aVHey luke!\u000aJust wondering, between you and tim who does the finger picking on the acoustic for tracks like blindfolds aside, mist, skies etc.
p7005
aVhey luke, i'm gonna be a dick and try to squeeze in two questions for the price of one.\u000aA. for a nerdy dude in med school who doesn't get a lot of playing time any longer, any particular scales, fingering exercises, or tips on how to try to continue developing all skills, but speed in particular?\u000a2. when you guys are writing, is there a formula or rule of thumb you use for coming up with a way to transition from one riff to another that  may be in a different key or time signature or just way different sounding from the previous line?
p7006
aVHey Luke,\u000a     What's your usual preshow/general warmup? You have a lost of fast blues scale and diminished runs, although I'm more familiar with the material off of Fortress to be honest. But I've always wondered what you all do to prepare before shows, with what seems to be more tedious practice riffs at crazy tempos. I hope this wasn't vague or that you got the wrong idea haha. Any word on Cam's or Arif's warmup/practice routine would be amazing as well. I'm more of a bassist than a guitarist. Thanks for making it through this long message!
p7007
aVCouldn't think of a question just wanted to say been a fan since the release of Blindfolds Aside MV, saw you guys Dec 27th and y'all played amazingly one of the best concerts I've ever been too. 
p7008
aV[deleted]
p7009
aVWhy do you always use guitars that have tremolos on them? I've never heard any even light trem use in any PTH songs, just curious why have them at all?
p7010
aV[deleted]
p7011
aVHey Luke! I've been listening to you guys since Kezia first hit the scene and PTH is by far my favorite band for a huge number of reasons. Thank you and the rest of the guys for making such meaningful/badass/mind-blowing material.\u000a\u000aIs there anyway we (the fans) could convince you guys to re-record Kezia with todays technology? I listen to at least one song from that album every single day and I love it... but I always think to myself "What would all of this sound like if it were recorded right after Volition?"\u000a\u000aAlso I'm curious - how are preorders going on the [next run of vinyls for the first 3 albums](http://www.kt8merch.com/store/pages/22255)? I made sure to get mine in but I was wondering how many you guys have since the initial 300 runs of each sold out within an hour. \u000a\u000aTHANKS FOR BEING KICKASS! :D
p7012
aVJust wanted to say that PTH is my all time favorite band, and of course you're one of my all time favorite guitarists. Scurrilous is one of the best albums in the history of time and it seriously helped me get through some really rough times after my mother's death from cancer in 2011. Can't wait till you guys come play in Atlanta again!
p7013
aVAre you guys going to do anything special for the ten year anniversary of Kezia? A re-record would be my dream come true
p7014
aVLet me preface this by saying how awesome you are; I love your guitar playing.\u000a\u000aI have two questions (or one question and one that's a series of smaller questions). \u000a\u000aThe series of smaller questions is how do you all write your music? Do you write music that will sound good to you guys, or easy/fun to play live, etc? Do you write music with a specific time signature or time sig. changes or do you just go with the groove?\u000a\u000aThe second question is what's your favorite food?
p7015
aVHey Trukey! Wanted to get your opinion on the new Periphery album. Thoughts? Likes? Dislikes?
p7016
aVSup Luke! If you could have one guitar lesson with anybody alive, who would it be and what would you want to learn?\u000a\u000aAlso i cant believe i missed protest in vancouver last year. I got my special my tshirt and album from the volition kickstart (or whatever site it was) campaign. I wore it when i met Dream Theater and the band and lots of fans have huge respect for you guys! Lots of good comments :)
p7017
aVHey,Luke!I'm a guitarist from Japan.I like to play your guitar very very much.And I play Protest the hero.But,I don't make your sound.What you use effecters&amp;amplifiers?It isn't be  informations at Japan.Sorry about my poor English.sorry about my poor English.
p7018
aVWhy do you guys sound like miley cyrus?
p7019
aVHey Luke,\u000a\u000aFirst of all: thanks for doing this AMA.  Huge fan of PTH and your playing.\u000a\u000aOn to the questions: What guitars have you owned and which one was  your favorite? \u000a
p7020
aVWhen did you start playing guitar and how much did you practice to get to the point you're at now? Did you learn much in terms of theory? Also if I'm ever wandering around Whitby will I possible bump into you guys? :P I'm from Trenton so I'm not too far away, aha. 
p7021
aVWho's Idea was it to cover NOFX?  Man, when you played Linoleum a the hoseshoe I lost my mind.\u000aAlso, any chance that you will pull out anything from A Calculated use of sound in the live show now that Arif is gone, or was our last chance for that that club show in toronto a few years back?
p7022
aVI hung out with you and Rody once in Billings after you played with The Human Abstract and As I Lay Dying. We got Taco's. Do you remember? 
p7023
aV[deleted]
p7024
aVHow do you feel about Newfoundland? Why did you decide to write a song about Newfoundland (mist)? How come you guys never play Heretics and killers live? Everyone loves that song. Thank you so much from St. John's 
p7025
aVLuke! I am a great fan of yours and since i'm also in a prog band, i'd like to know how and where do you get ideas for your compositions.\u000a(PS : I got the volition cover tattooed in my right arm because i fucking love you guys)
p7026
aVWhat do you think about Lye By Mistake?
p7027
aVHi Luke! What are some bands you enjoy that may not receive enough or any(!) marketing or exposure?\u000a\u000aBeen a fan since the week Fortress was released. I saw you guys in Tulsa, OK w/ AILD, THA, and MyChildren a few years back, and loved the show! Even though Arif's entire bass rig seemed to die during the last song. :O\u000a\u000aThanks for all the music you've been a part of. Music is love, life, and medicine.
p7028
aVI know it's obviously a long time before you're thinking of doing another tour but will you come back to England for more shows? Honestly seeing you live was amazing (I was the Habs fanboy in Southampton) and I wanted to know how you thought the crowds were?
p7029
aV[deleted]
p7030
aVHey Luke! Just want to say I remember the 2nd time I went to see you guys live (3 times so far) It was in Ottawa at Mavericks I think. I got to take a pic with Tim &amp; chilled with Moe outside, After talking to Moe for a bit he decided to head to the tour bus so I asked him If he could get you to come outside and take a picture (You being my favorite guitarist) I waited a few seconds and sure enough you walked out of the bus with smile to take a picture. Just wanted to say Thank you for that, Because I know that it's not everyone who would've done that after a really long show everyone was pretty tired. You're Awesome! I'll never forget that. 
p7031
aVIf you played an entire different genre of music, what would it be?
p7032
aVHow was working with Chris Adler?\u000a
p7033
aVWhich of your peers in modern metal do you admire/respect and for what reasons?
p7034
aVHey Luke, I know you're a guitarist but you do your share of vocals as well of course. Have you always been able to do harmonies or did you and Rody practice for those early on? Thanks!
p7035
aVhey! i think i've talked to you and rody about this before but i can't thank you guys enough for writing songs about women, it's been really important to me to hear lines like "i hope she knows how much i respect her." ...not something you get to hear in music a whole lot. so yeah, much appreciation. i guess that makes my question, will you accept cookies as a bribe to play turn soonest to the sea live??
p7036
aVWhat are your thoughts on virtual horse racing?
p7037
aVWill you ever stop play Blindfolds Aside? How about playing Divinity Within? (if you ever do please play it in london, mama needs some love as well)
p7038
aV[deleted]
p7039
aVHey Luke! If you were an animal what animal would you be. Also tell Tim thanks for signing my shoe. Much love from your girl lady G
p7040
aVHey Luke, just wanted to say that I started listening to you guys when I was about 12 and it really changed the way I view and appreciate music and other aspects of life in general (C'est La Vie being one example that does that). I'm not a musician nor am I able to think of any deep and thoughtful questions to ask so I'll just go ahead and ask how has your day been?
p7041
aVHow pissed were you when the crossing the border incident occured?\u000a\u000a
p7042
aVHey Luke, you and the boys are wonderful. Keep making songs like those on the first three albums, especially Scurrilous. Volition was alright, but c'mon...\u000a\u000aHave a lovely day.
p7043
aVHi Luke I was curious, is Plato's Tripartite about anyone in particular? (namely Retheah Parsons?) \u000a\u000aAlso bravo Volition is pure fucking gold I still can't stop listening to it (along with Scurrilous)
p7044
aVHi Luke,\u000a\u000aFirst and foremost, thanks for being a part of this amazing band...you guys are so much fun to listen too! I loved every moment of your show at Krank'd and can not wait to see you guys again in April!\u000a\u000aQ: How did you guys find SA compared to other countries, why did you decide to come back?\u000a\u000aSee you soon! \u005cm/
p7045
aVHey Luke! I've been using your songs as a way to improve my guitar skills and honestly, i've been seeing quite some improvement and they're so freaking fun to play! so first, i'd like to thank you for that and creating such epic music \u005cm/ so, 1st: do you have any exercises, routine or anything to improve your guitar playing you could share? and 2nd: do you ever plan to come to portugal? chill mate!
p7046
aVHey Luke! Who are your favorite bands/artists currently?
p7047
aVHey Luke! I saw PTH in Kingston- got really trashed and had an awesome time. I just have two questions for you:\u000a\u000a-How old were you when you all started working on Kezia? \u000a\u000a-What was something wacky that happened to you while abroad this year?\u000a\u000aThanks for the great music man! Here's hoping I see you guys again soon!
p7048
aVHey man. Big Protest fan here. Volitions is one of my favorite metal albums and Chris Adler knocked the drum tracks out of the park. How was working with him in the studio? Was there time to just sit back and talk and chill with him or was it straight up just lay tracks and leave?
p7049
aVMy buddy Chris gave you an enormous essay when you guys were playing a show in Florida. Did anybody ever read that?
p7050
aVI've seen you guys three times live now, most recently at the Wolverhampton gig back in November. Firstly just wanted to say I adore your passion and playing and thanks for all the great experiences you've given me.\u000a\u000aWould it be possible to bring vinyl pressings to England next time you tour in Europe? I already have the Volition edition from your crowdsourcing effort, but due to high import costs have been unable to purchase any others!\u000a\u000aThanks!
p7051
aVLuke, how do I get sexy? 
p7052
aVAny chance we can get "A Calculated Use of Sound" on the US iTunes store? Or any US outlet? 
p7053
aVHey Luke, who's the female voice on Volition?
p7054
aVI guess you mean Jadea Kelly?
p7055
aVYes! Thanks /u/Gallygher.
p7056
aVHave you guys ever thought of turning Kezia into a movie?
p7057
aVSaw you in Cornwall Ontario, thanks for the great show, are you planning to make any of the festivals in the summer? Preferably Heavy MTL?
p7058
aVHey boy. Will there be more farting bums?
p7059
aVYou've always seemed like a pretty fit guy Luke. So I wonder. How much can you bench? 
p7060
aVHello Luke! I don't know if you remember me, but we shared some beers back at your Roxy show in November 2013! \u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/fQfY1Gz.jpg?1\u000aHere is me with the lovely Timmy. I just wanted to say that I appreciate the amounts of effort you put into your playing and the meaning behind your songs. Our conversation really helped me buck up my own writing, so thank you!\u000a\u000aIf I have to think of a good question to ask to keep your attention, I'll ask, how do you get the inspiration to write strange riffs in odd time signatures? I try my hardest to experiment and with some difficulty, it might come out well. What is your writing method with time signatures?
p7061
aVYou've always seemed like a pretty fit guy Luke. So I wonder. How much can you bench? 
p7062
aVHe can do a lot of burpees. I've seen it
p7063
aVHey Luke,\u000a\u000aI was just wondering how you guys tend to settle/come up with song titles. Is there much thought put into it or is it pretty instantaneous, like "That seems like the right name". Who tends to come up with the titles? I guess this goes for album titles as well. \u000a\u000aI was just wondering since you guys have some pretty unique track names. I remember coming across Fortress and being struck by Bloodmeat. It's so self-explanatory but also really bizarre. Meaty blood - marinara with meat sauce. \u000a\u000aRandom aside - I remember when you guys opened for Dragonforce at the Agora in Cleveland like 8-10 years ago and your snare drum broke or something, but you decided to keep going anyway even as the crowd grew kind of hostile and started booing. I always felt bad about that, but thanks for still coming back to Cleveland!
p7064
aVhey luke, any suggestions on getting a pth-ish sound with axe fx 2? I get the sound directly from axe fx though. 
p7065
aVKezia is probably one of my favorite albums of all time. Will The Divine Suicide of K ever rejoin the set? \u000a\u000aAlso please please please tour with BTBAM and melt all of our collective faces.
p7066
aVHi there Luke! Big fan - only got into you guys with the release of Voilition but went back to all the earlier stuff and am now totally sold, you guys are extremely talented and a damn good jam.\u000a\u000aYou and Tim both have quite a distinctive tone with a lot of midrange presence. What was the motivation behind having such a prominent midrange in a genre where most bands prefer a scooped sound?\u000aAnd hell, whilst we're at it, I know you were using a Splawn Nitro - what's in your current rig?
p7067
aVHey Luke, no question from me.  Just wanted to say that Protest has been my favourite band since I was 14 and that might not sound like much, but it's eerie to think I've been listening to you guys for 1/3 of my life.  Thank you and everyone else who works with you for putting out fantastic music.  I can't find the originality that I find with Protest anywhere else.  You guys are the best.\u000a\u000a
p7068
aVThanks for doing this Luke. I bought the tab books from sheet happens a few years ago - thanks for tabbing your music out and shipping to little old England. :o)\u000a\u000aIf you're still around, what's your favourite thing to practice? A specific song? Or perhaps a specific scale that you like to noodle around in?
p7069
aVProbably a bit late in the AMA to catch you, but...\u000a\u000aProtest has one of the qualities I most love in a band, and by that I mean you guys, even as one of my favorite bands, still have so much potential. A big part of why I'm so excited by what you guys do is that I always feel like you're on the verge of the next great idea in your canon; something beyond what you've already done.\u000a\u000aOne such thing I'm often curious about is the use of additional instrumentation, particularly the acoustic guitar, piano, and string-driven passages in your albums. Even Jadea Kelly could be included in this regard. My question is, do you guys ever contemplate composing music that more thoroughly embraces instrumentation outside of the standard rock combo? I'm obviously not advocating you write "Every Rose Has Its Thorns" or some shit, but I hear those passages like the ones at the end of "Mist" or "Blindfolds Aside" and they really move me.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR**, Could you ever see Protest the Hero further embracing instrumentation outside of the standard guitar/bass/drums rock format for full-length songs?
p7070
aVHey Luke love your work thank you for your time. \u000a\u000aHave you heard anything about Rocksmith? The game that teaches you how to play guitar. I am a big gamer and it peaked my interest as something to get me over the hump of learning an instrument. Would love to know any thoughts you had on it? 
p7071
aVWhich section gave you the most trouble when it came around to learning and tightening up PoT material? What aspect of it made you struggle and how did you overcome your initial issues with it?\u000a\u000aSecond, which riff/section that you have wrote is your favourite and why?\u000a\u000aThanks! \u000a\u000aPS: Protest are next-level incredible and you are awesome! 
p7072
aVKezia was, and is, one of the shreddiest, technically laden albums I've heard all around, was it a conscious decision to make it that way? Coming off of the other albums, which to me sound more drawn back to a degree, how do you look back at it?
p7073
aVMy name is also lucas. I play guitar. Havr you accepted i am the superior lucas?
p7074
aV[deleted]
p7075
aVYou guys always seem incredibly happy and it's fucking awesome.
p7076
aVI know you guys are really proud of the music you've put out (as you should), but I've heard a few times that there are some guitar sections in your songs that you regret writing because they're such a pain in the ass to play live (like those stupid fast triplet runs in Sequoia Throne). So what's your least favourite riff to play from your discography?
p7077
aVFirst thing, not a question, you're a sexy beast.\u000a\u000aNow, the question(s), if I'm not mistaken you guys came to Brazil back in 2012, do you guys plan on coming back anytime soon? Also, how does it feel to play outside of North America? Do you feel like the response from the audience is different?
p7078
aVHey Luke, huge fan, I've been going to your shows since the days of The Dungeon in Oshawa.\u000a\u000aI started playing guitar almost 7 months ago and I started with Sequoia Throne.. Which was probably a bad choice, but whatever. I'm almost done with the song but I'm struggling to get [a few parts up to 100% speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwld4kmCmec). \u000a\u000aWere there any exercises in particular that you worked on for your speed? \u000a\u000aAnd are you offering in-person lessons at the moment? I've tried going to your bandhappy page but that site always seems to time-out for me. \u000a\u000aPS. I'm over in Peterborough and the last show you guys played here was ridiculously good.
p7079
aVWhat is your favourite choice of chip?
p7080
aVWhat's your favorite Canadian Whisky?
p7081
aVYou were at the Toronto Maximum the Hormone show a few years ago, right? I think we talked about you guys touring together. I'm sad that never happened.
p7082
aVHello Luke, Big fan. Do you see yourself continuing to write more polished sounding records? Just a a personal taste thing for me, but some modern metal band's guitars sound too much like synths to me. I love your guitar tones and mixing job done on scurrilous.  
p7083
aVDo you think you guys will ever re-release all of 'A Calculated Use of Sound,' even if it's just digitally? I'd buy that, yo. 
p7084
aVAny chance you guys would play through an entire album live? It could be any of them, I just think it'd be cool to see that
p7085
aVI know you guys in PTH fucking love your beer. \u000a\u000aSo what's your favourite fucking beer? 
p7086
aVHey, Luke! First off, you're a huge inspiration, and in my opinion, one of the greatest guitarists to ever live. Among the many questions I have, I'll narrow it down to three.\u000a1. You have a rediculous tapping technique, any tips at all for speed and jumping around the strings would be amazing.\u000a2. Who were some of your biggest influences on the guitar?\u000a3. Have you and Tim ever thought of jumping up to 7-strings as many in your genre have done? I'm a pretty big fan of both styles; you guys can do more with 6 than most can with 8. Cheers! Hope to see you in NY at some point soon!
p7087
aVWhen VH1 eventually makes a Behind the Music about you will the period between Scurrilous and Volition be the dramatic part they flash forward to before each commercial to keep you watching? Or was it not that bad?
p7088
aVHey Luke! I always wonder what you and the rest of the guys do when you're not doing band stuff, any hobbies you do on the side?? Huge props on staying original through the years man, keep up the good work:D 
p7089
aVHi Luke, I would like to know what riff/solo/lick/part of a song struck you as "wow, fuck thats good. We've gotta include that" as you were writing it or even something that came spur of the moment that you really thought was great. \u000a\u000aPS: Play absolutely as many home town T.O shows as you can, theres something about seeing you guys in Toronto that makes me really proud and happy PTH is from here.
p7090
aVHey Luke! \u000a\u000aI am curious what you think of the Exes for Eyes #ThePlatinumProject, Or if you have even heard about it? (link to their update https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJyhwQfUNvQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) \u000a\u000aWhats your opinion on underground bands taking this route to distributing their music?
p7091
aVLuke! I must know your thoughts on tone!\u000aI've been listening to you guys since about about 08' and and you guys have been my favorite ever since. What REALLY gets PtH to ignite a flame into my soul (and not to mention give me some crackhead-like air guitar when I'm walking outside) is how you really sound to my ears. You and Tim got really know your sound expectations. \u000a\u000aWhat's your EQ set up usually like for shows?\u000a\u000aThere's something about players that have these perfect groovy and melodic chops combined with this clean distorted solid tone. People that come to mind off the top are like Alan Holdsworth, Paul Waggoner, and Mario Camerena from Chon. \u000a\u000aWhat is some groovy music that you listen to that may inspire some of the chops you have?\u000a\u000aWhat are some exercises that become really cool skills after mastered?\u000a
p7092
aV[deleted]
p7093
aVJust wanted to say I was very proud to be a part of your crowd funding effort on Volition and am a happy owner of the vinyl! When you write songs how do you know when you're done? Do you abide by any formula when constructing riffs?
p7094
aVIf you're still here I want to ask you if you could suggest any thing I should learn about. Or study in art or music
p7095
aVHey luke, just want to tell you how much I love the band first off, and how much they've meant to me since middle school.\u000a\u000aSecond, I won some sort of contest with your indygogo campaign from Volition, and still haven't received my stuff. Would love to know if there's any way I can still receive my prize.\u000a\u000aThanks so much!!
p7096
aVWhen will you be coming back to Montreal?\u000a\u000aAlso would it be possible to show [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0z_7bKm258) to Rody any time soon?
p7097
aV[deleted]
p7098
aVHey Luke! just want to say you guys are the absolute nicest bunch of dudes I've ever met, it's always great chatting with you guys after shows.\u000a\u000aI guess something I've always wanted to know is, how often is it a conscious decision to write parts that reference old songs on your recent stuff?\u000aFirst one that comes to mind is the "We are, we are, we are still alive" bit on Animal Bones, Are there other little nuggets we might have missed that are less obvious?\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso sometime back in 2008 - '09 Rody showed us he got a pink belly button piercing when he was wasted, how's it healing?
p7099
aVSo, I live in Yellowknife, NWT, Canada. We have a small metal crowd here, but if we were able to do the leg work organizing a show, would you play here? May only be for 50 people.\u000a
p7100
aVThis. I think the excuse to travel and visit the north alone should be worth it.
p7101
aV[deleted]
p7102
aVWhen I saw you guys in Sydney during the Meet and Greet I froze up and rambled about nonsense because I was in the same room as metal GODS. Now I can't think of a reasonable question :(

aVLuke, a while back some of you guys did some online lessons on some website I forgot all about. Would you be willing to ever do something like that again? I'm in a huge rut with guitar right now, and you are by far my favorite player. I can learn songs that are on a similar level of difficulty as your stuff, but at the same time PtH songs are so... WEIRD that it is hard to grasp how it all comes together when you learn it part by part. \u000a\u000aI really look forward to eventually seeing you guys live, so far you've not come anywhere near me in the states. &lt;/3
p7104
aVJust wanted to say I really love your work man. I love all the albums, but I think I'm gonna have to say the Fortress is my favorite one. I love the grand nature of the Lyrics and I feel like the combo of the music and lyrics on this album paints epic pictures in my head better than any of the rest. It is a solid piece of brutal, classical infused, high art. I got it when it first came out and it hasn't gotten old to me yet. Thanks!!\u000a\u000aCan't wait for another album. 
p7105
aVHave you listened to Destrage? Because PTH sounds similar to them in its own way. maybe its the singing style but I dunno, check them out if you feel like it.\u000a\u000aCheers for good music!

aVThank you for your amazing music! I'm late to discovering you, the first song I heard of yours was Clarity last summer, and it truly blew my mind! I wanted to ask why you guys have the nerve to be such amazing musicians and bring shame to so many other people.

p7112
aVmy question, who are some of your favorite artists outside of the rock and metal genres? \u000a\u000athanks for doing this Luke. Got the pleasure of meeting you after a show you did at the Granada in Lawrence, Kansas around the time Scurrilous was released. My friend and I got to meet you, Rody, and Moe out back afterwards (not sure where Arif and Tim were at), our picture came out sorta blurry and when we mentioned that Rody looked over at you and said something like "It totally captures the moment, we're blurry people!" to which you agreed, it was pretty hilarious.\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/QoeUZe1.jpg\u000a\u000aThanks for that. Please come back to the Midwestern states! (Missouri perhaps?)
p7113
aVOk Lucas, here's the plan:\u000a1- Start a fundraiser to get Arif back to pth.\u000a2- Give 300k to Arif.\u000a3- No one would turn down that offer.\u000a4- ?????\u000a5- Everyone will be happy.
p7114
aVI'm in.
p7115
aVHey Luke! Imma big ol' PTH fan here. I'm also a writer and the plot line for Kezia has always intrigued me although I've never quite understood it, can you maybe give me a brief explanation or tell me which lyrics help explain it? That'd be great! \u000abtw my favorite live show ever was when y'all were in Baton Rouge, LA w/ battlecross 
p7116
aVJust wanted to say thanks. I've never been inspired playing-wise and creatively as much as with PTH.
p7117
aVHey Luke I'm a big fan of the band and I'm wondering when you guys are thinking about comeing back to Texas! 
p7118
aVAre there any up-and-coming bands in your genre/on your radar that you think we should give a listen to?
p7119
aVHey Luke!  I saw your show in Boston with TSF, Battlecross, and Intervals, and it was absolutely kickass, so thanks for that.\u000a\u000aHow old were you guys when Kezia was written/recorded?  Did being that young / in school affect the songwriting, structural, and musical decisions made on that album?\u000a\u000aWhat is your favorite PTH album and why?\u000a\u000aWhat is the best riff you have ever written?\u000a\u000aWhy was To Porter, With Love not included in the English version of Scurrilous?\u000a\u000aAny chance you guys could throw a remake of "Is Anyone There?" or "These Colours Don't Run" our way?  That would be ideal.\u000a\u000aAnd, finally, what is Drumhead Trial about?\u000a\u000aThanks!
p7120
aVAlso, believe it or not, I found out about PTH from an online rhythm game called FlashFlashRevolution, which had a couple tracks from Kezia on it.  It caught my ear and I really enjoyed the technical prowess from all members as well as the lyrical content.\u000a\u000aAnd proud owner of the red Kezia vinyl.
p7121
aVDo you ever feel like some of the things Rody says on stage are too out there? I love his banter but it seems like he really regrets it according to the lyrics of "Toungue-Splitter"
p7122
aVHey fellow,\u000a\u000aAround the time you released Kezia, how much time did you all spend practicing each week, both individually and as a band? You all were pretty young (16, 17?) and I know plenty of players in their 20s who'd struggle to play those songs on their own, let alone pull them off as a band in a live setting.

aVHey Luke, firstly I want to say thank you for creating some amazing music! Secondly, with this year being the 10 year anniversary of the release of Kezia (which makes me feel really fucking old), do you guys have anything special planned? It's always been a dream of mine to see that album performed live in its entirety.

aVLuke please let the band know that [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFCONxIl98) should become a yearly tradition. Possibly a christmas miracle each year? I'll get a kickstarter going to buy you guys a touring van and then break it on the way to SLC
p7136
aVHey Luke\u000aApologies for the late post. Blame the stupid South African time zone.\u000aThat said it's pretty obvious I am fired up to see you guys this year.\u000aI cried rivers of blood and puppies when I couldn't make it to JHB for your maiden gig here and I'm so glad I get the chance to finally see my favourite band in Stellenbosch.\u000aThat said I have three questions:\u000a1: Will the set-list be public knowledge?\u000a2: Will it include Mist? My face is in need of a good melting.\u000a3: Can I buy you guys a round of beers after the show?\u000a\u000aSincerely\u000aChris

p7139
aVHey Luke! Hope nobody has asked you this!\u000a\u000a\u000a**Would you rather have:**\u000a\u000a- $1,000,000 in a long-term investment making 5% interest (that's $50,000 a year, truke!)\u000a\u000a- a Protest The Hero cover band in the Toronto area that played even better than your band live, and was always amazing to hang out with?
p7140

aVIs there any guitar instructional DVD or online lessons which pushed your playing to the next level?
p7143
aVHey Luke, Ive Seen you 2014 im Bochum (Matrix) germany, The first time ive Seen Protest, it was that fuckin amazing! I was 15 and Been there with daddy, makes too prog-music. After the Show, we just gone backstage, we said to the security we were musicians too and they believed it, then you was the first member ive seen i was so shitty nerveus! can you remember the little guy with the Protest hat and Protest t-shirt? :-D

aV"So when you bled on the bed as you fed those expectations, as a whore, not a human you embraced with hesitation, the very parameters of all you can be \u2014 not a mother, not an aunt, not a sister that's not subdued. Because dignity is not physical, and your flesh means more than you."\u000a\u000aI just want to say how much I love the lyrics in your songs, especially the ultra-feminist ones. ESPECIALLY Turn Soonest To The Sea. I think it's my favourite. It's rare to find a metal band that seems to really support feminism, by that I mean you're the only one I've found. Ever. Besides your unique sound and serious talent and skills, this is what made you guys really stand out to me. Your feminism; portrayed by dripping sarcasm and angry accusations. I love you. Please play shows in Ottawa every month and also marry me. 
p7145
aVWhen are you coming to Finland?
p7146
aVHow much alcohol does my country need to donate to the band on their next visit  in order to get a tribute song like NFL did? \u000a\u000aThe People of Australia have a bounty of booze and i think i can convince the government to step it up for such an honour.

p7150
aVHi Luke! Saw you guys in Karlsruhe last year, great time. Anyway, what constitutes for you a "bad crowd" or that would make you want to leave the premises as fast as possiblr? As in, what would make a crowd either boring to play to, or borderline dangerous (e.g. too many people holding broken bottles). Both cases acceptable as a response.
p7151
aVHey Luke.  \u000alast december I saw you guys live in Karlsruhe and we hung out till about 2 o'clock. [Here's a picture of you, tim and dez from the safety fire with us.](http://i.imgur.com/KpvYWzo.jpg)  \u000aI'm the guy und the bottom right.\u000a\u000aNow my question is this:  \u000aCan you name the 15 albums/eps/singles, that are currently without much thinking about it, the closest to your heart? Just 15 releases that come to mind that you absolutely love. There can be several releases from one band, too.\u000a\u000aThanks for everything. You guys are great :)
p7152
aVHey Luke! Saw you guys live in Germany (first time i saw a band live) and it was amazing.\u000aTo get to the questioning part:\u000a  What gave you the idea(s) for Kezia? I mean how'd you guys get to the thought of linking the songs together story-like?\u000a
p7153
aVHey Luke! First off I want to say that you guys have been a huge inspiration to me, and I love the music down to every note. I have a few questions.\u000aWith Arif and Moe gone, do you think the style of future albums with be any different from your past albums? Will we see more acoustic pieces? More American Tours (especially in Missouri?;) )\u000aI think it would be great to see a "reworked" version of ACUOS, not that I don't love the original, but I think that it'd be really interesting to see how the band's sound has evolved. Thank you! Keep on melting faces and kicking ass!\u000a

aVWhat would it take for you to play at my wedding june 25 2016 in Niagara ontario?
p7155
aVWhat happened with Rody and the guys from Alexisonfire?
p7156
aVWhat is your favorite riff off the Fortress record?\u000aAnd by the way, saw you guys in Norway when you were there.\u000aAwesome show, you're a mean guitar machine!
p7157
aVHi Luke! Big fan here! So, if you could choose any bands or musical artists on the planet, who would be alongside you on your dream tour?
p7158
aVLuke do you like alexi laiho 
p7159
aVLuke! Big time fan and fellow Whitby native! Are you a member of the Canadian beard olympic team?
p7160
aVI went to a show in Reno to see you guys, must've been a few years back. My friends and I got kinda lost and stumbled upon your bus. I knocked on the door and one of you opened the door. Thinking quick, I made an offering of the two girls I was with. You politely declined and gave us directions to the small venue (it was actually a bar.) After the show you signed both my friend's boobs.\u000a\u000aDo you remember that night? 
p7161
aVI didn't think you'd actually keep answering all the questions but since it looks like you might I'll toss a late one in.\u000a\u000aI think I read somewhere that you guys had 3 extra songs off scurrilous that didn't make the cut, one being To Porter With Love and then two others. Are you planning on releasing the other two at any point? \u000a\u000aThanks for making such great tunes and treating your fans so well! Come back to Winnipeg whenever you can, we can't get enough of you guys over here. \u000a
p7162
aVMight be too late but hey. . I was part of the Volition crowd funding. . Why is my name the only one with non capitals on the record.. It's cool but I was like wtf... oh Btw met you.. Love you
p7163
aVVery late to the party and little thought of you seeing this, but after reading the ama a few days ago I really started listening to your music beyond the handful of songs I knew and had marked as favorites on Spotify. \u000a\u000aEnjoying the shit out of it and decided to try and learn at least a riff or two. The ending of The Divine Suicide of K almost made me tear up, so decided to try that song first. My hands and head hurt and I'm only somewhat clean at 25% speed. It's amazing you did this at such a young age. Massive respect.\u000a\u000aSo, a question: a: play more in Sweden? We did give you Mats Sundin so... \U0001f609
p7164
aVAre you guys gonna be in Indianapolis or Southern Florida anytime soon?
p7165
aVWhy is the intro to Limb from Limb (or outro to Palms read) not on the instrumental version of Fortress? It's seriously the best intro you guys have ever done.
p7166
aVeverything you guys make is awesome but is there a chance of doing something live from a calculated use of sound, its my favourite also is there anywhere I could buy an lp of it.
p7167
aVHey Luke, my name is Mathew. This warm summer night here in old dusty ass AZ, you played at Club Red. Whilst listening to the last band perform before you and the rest of p-test hit the stage, I recall peaking back stage. We locked eyes, I had no shirt on at the time so you gave me a weird forwarded brow. But I believe a star was born that night. 
p7168
aVHonestly, it's tough to look away from shirtless dudes.  Obviously we all understand that fact.  I am glad we made something special big fella!
p7169
aVLuke!  You are my hero.  \u000a\u000aCan you please tell me what is your methodology to picking your tone? I'm especially talking about your live tone where I know you don't change your tone that much between sections of the song.  Whenever I try to play your songs, I notice i'm either not using enough gain and then the tapping parts kind of fade out quickly or I use too much gain and it just sounds messy.   I have the exact same Ibanez s5470 as you have too with some barknuckle pickups and I find that despite the awesome playability of the guitar, the sustain isn't really the greatest
p7170
aVThe S guitars definitely forfeit some sustain for the thinness of the body.  I moved over to RG guitars mainly for that reason.  That and they began to feel like a toy when I played them on stage and it got uncomfortable.\u000aA kids hairband will generally help with the two hand tapping stuff.  You just have to get used to sliding here around!
p7171
aVAhh that makes sense.. As far as tone goes what is your 'philosophy' on what makes good guitar tone?  Do you like mostly mids, some bass, little treble?  And what kind of effects do you use live that contribute to your unique sound, if any(i.e compressor, overdrive pedal, etc.)?\u000a\u000aThanks for responding!
p7172
aVTruke! I have a couple gear questions. What do you like about the Ibanez S series over the regular bodied line? Also, what pickups are you using nowadays? Your tone on Volition was absolutely monstrous!
p7173
aVVolition tone was mainly a re-amped axe fx.  We took DI signal while recording and ended up not being too happy with the final tone.  So we re amped it.  I am happy with how it came out, but would go for a more natural / organic tube tone next time I think.  Or maybe mix the two tones more.\u000a\u000a\u000aI use predominantly RG series guitars now.  I like them for their bigger bodies, and sustain.  I haven't used S series on stage for years.  However, they will always be the ultimate couch writing guitars for their size, shape, and playability.
p7174
aVJust wanted to let you know I took part in the Volition crowdfund and preordered the entire discography on vinyl (Volition also) last week!\u000a\u000aStay cool!
p7175
aVyes, luke if you do another crowdfund we will all be back for more
p7176
aVHello Luke :) What are your opinions on games like Rocksmith?
p7177
aVNot to nag, but am I seriously ever going to get my kick starter pack? 
p7178
aVWe didn't do a Kickstarter campaign.  But if you mean IGG - just email us at pthofficial@gmail.com - we realize there are still some of you who didn't get their perks, but also have found a lot of those moved addresses, frigged up their address details, thought they ordered but actually didn't etc.  It will help us if you can verify your purchase and we can go from there.  Would never want you to pay for something and not get it.\u000aAnd genuinely appreciate your contribution and patience.

That's obviously not objective facts that could suggest when it was recorded.\u000a\u000aA young-looking Geoff Tate? Nope, don't care. It's all about the *style* man. Which brings me to another clue:\u000a\u000a* The *style*, man.

aVThis was on the "Empire" tour and I think this video was recorded in May 1991. They recorded three nights of the show and released it as Operation:Livecrime.\u000a\u000aI saw this tour and didn't know much about the band.  They played all of Operation:Mindcrime and it was amazing.

aVYou lucky duck! No knowledge of what you're getting into and you get to see Queensryche in their prime putting on the entirety of one of the greatest metal albums of all-time. It must have been something else.\u000a\u000aIf only I was into good music as a child, I could have gone as well!
p7243
aVOperation: Mindcrime is one of my top 10 albums of all time, love it!
p7244
aVI got drawn in by listening to "The Mission" on vinyl. About six songs later I didn't know where the time went.\u000a\u000aOperation: Mindcrime is truly one of the masterpieces of my lifetime.
p7245
aVIt's so sad how once the Lead Guitarist (spacing on his name) left and Tate took helm, the band fell dramatically. Now that Tate's out and La Torre is in, the band sounds a lot better.\u000a\u000aI saw them live in Renton, WA for free, with La Torre. Man did they sound great, I even got a drum-stick from Scott Rockenfield that was tossed into the crowd.
p7246
aVChris DeGarmo is who you're thinking of. When he left...Queensryche just changed. It's like a really subtle shift but I don't find any post-DeGarmo stuff interesting. And I especially think Tate's new album is bad. The LaTorre album is...meh. kinda okay. I just really miss DeGarmo
p7247
aVYeah the new stuff is decent. I meant the live performance of the older stuff is more proficient.
p7248
aVChris DeGarmo? Once he left the band did go downhill dramatically, but I don't know that the quality declining was solely because Tate took the helm. He had a lot of credit and was involved with the material right from the start.\u000a\u000aActually, the band as a whole seemed to do a lot together as a group early on. I think the problems came after Tate seemed to dictate the musical direction the band was going to take with no input from the other guys. If you look at the newest album with La Torre, there's a lot more group involvement in the song writing department.\u000a\u000aAnyway there's no way we can know for sure what happened after a certain point. All I'm looking forward to is another Queensryche album. And in spite of all I said about DeGarmo, if he was mentioned as involved in the album I might just poop my pants from excitement.

The new vocalist is good, but not quite as powerful as the last guy, even though he does mimic the original singer quite well.
p7262
aVAww, no Mikko? I didn't realize that. Boo. Still, what a huge track. This actually reminds me quite a bit of Swallow the Sun, ironically. 
p7263
aVDark. Doomy. Delicious. I just got into this band a few weeks ago so I don't really have a strong opinion on the new vocalist, but I like what I'm hearing!
p7264
aVCheck out their last 2 albums. They're phenomenal
p7265
aVThe clean vocals are certainly different than the last front man but the harsh vocals are spot on. Will take a little getting used to but overall I love the track and have high hopes for the new album overall.
p7266
aVI dunno, I'm not really feeling the clean or harsh vocals. The clean one doesn't seem to fit the music well, and the harsh one is a bit too raspy for my liking. It may just take some getting used to, but it's a bummer since I didn't know until now that they got a new singer.

VFairly certain this one's going to be in their HoF post, but it's still cool. IMO, this track is even better than Anesthetize (I know, radical opinion here); it all just comes together so perfectly.
p7289
aVI love Anesthetize, but I agree, Arriving Somewhere But Not Here is the song that got me into PT and will always be my favorite of theirs.
p7290
aVAgreed. I actually think Deadwing is better than Fear (albums)
p7291
aVI love PT, I love Arriving Somewhere and Anesthetize, but I love even more Steven Wilson solo albums.  \u000aGuthrie Govan was already my favorite guitarist, and with Steven he's even better!
p7292
aVI'm with you on this. I don't think Anesthetize is a bad song at all, but I don't think it's anywhere near as great as everyone makes it out to be. FoBP as a whole was my least favorite album. 
p7293
aVShame, it's my favorite by a mile. Anesthetize is absolutely incredible, definitely my favorite 10+ minute PT song.

p7302
aVIt makes me sad that not enough people know about them. I found them from this [hilarious Unholy Confessions cover with subtitles](http://youtu.be/ZtMuzFA-URA) on their channel. They had a link to their music and I thought it would be another shitty deathcore nobody band. Now they are on my list of go to bands to listen to. 
p7303
aVHoly shit I remember watching that way back in 2009. Really cool that they ended up pretty successful and wrote a kick ass LP in "Scryers of the Ibis"\u000a\u000a\u000aSTEPPIN IN SHIT, JOHN!\u000a

aVYup, the opening riff is my favourite part. \u000a\u000aPS: love your work! 
p7348
aVI hate to be that guy, and I want to love it so much, but with the opening being so powerful, I feel that what it builds up to is a bit of a let down. The spoken Japanese part kinda ruins the flow of the song for me too. :(

aVThis has been recommended more than once, so I'll have to take your word for it- it's going on the list!
p7356
aVI nominate Steven Wilson's "Ancestral" as a track in the 2015 playlist. 
p7357
aVOh right, I'd say you should have a playlist that's exclusively clean vocals for people who want to get into the genre but (like me) don't dig the growling. 
p7358
aVThen help me get some songs together :)\u000a\u000aI'd love some suggestions for clean bands. I know Haken is mostly clean, and I think Chon(?). We can divide up the main playlist by vocals, like this sub breaks up posts.

aVOkay, so out of the bands you listed that I know, I'm going to start listing songs for each:\u000a\u000aPTH - [C'est La Vie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZ-eKBJ9dw)\u000a\u000aPeriphery - [Ragnarok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyHFVtgsCzI)\u000a\u000aTesseracT - [Lament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C99SU-IjYQ)\u000a\u000aDevin Townsend - [Kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nubJjB95VdY)\u000a\u000aTool - [Ænema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCEeAn6_QJo)\u000a\u000aBTBAM - [Swim to the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhkpCjmXHTU) (might be too long for newcomers to get into, though, so I'm not sure)\u000a\u000aAAL - [CAFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfzWpp0hMc)\u000a\u000aAnd, aside from that, I think bands that deserve mention are:\u000a\u000a\u000a* Ne Obliviscaris\u000a\u000a* Monuments\u000a\u000a* Vildhjarta\u000a\u000a* Sikth\u000a\u000a* Haken\u000a\u000a* Mastodon\u000a\u000a* Gojira\u000a\u000a* Porcupine Tree\u000a\u000a* Cynic\u000a\u000a* Meshuggah\u000a\u000a* After the Burial\u000a\u000a* Veil of Maya\u000a\u000a* Corelia\u000a\u000a* (Shorter songs by) Dream Theater\u000a\u000a* The Human Abstract\u000a\u000a* Glasscloud\u000a\u000a* Destiny Potato\u000a\u000a* Red Seas Fire\u000a\u000a* Reflux\u000a\u000a* Chimp Spanner\u000a\u000a* Cloudkicker\u000a\u000aAnd that's all I can think of for now, but more will come later, rest assured.\u000a\u000aAll the song suggestions I put up are up for debate, so if you have any recommendations, then please let me know! I think this assortment would best suit a "Getting into Prog" or "Best Of Prog" playlist, rather than a 2015 playlist. Just my opinion.
p7368
aVDon't forget about the old schoolers!  Symphony X and Blind Guardian.  Angra is another good one, though might lean more towards power metal.  Planet X &amp; Liquid Tension Experiment for those who want their instrumental fix.  Not necessarily metal, but The Mars Volta shouldn't be overlooked.  Ayreon for sure as well.  
p7369
aVMy suggestions for classic late 80s/mid 90s:\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aDream Theater - Metropolis Pt 1 \u000a\u000aFates Warning - Guardian\u000a\u000aPsychotic Waltz - Into The Everflow\u000a\u000aDeath - Crystal Mountain\u000a\u000aCynic - Veil of Maya\u000a\u000aSymphony X - Of Sins And Shadows\u000a\u000aAtheist - Unquestionable Presence\u000a\u000aThreshold - Paradox\u000a\u000aVoivod - Le Pont Noir\u000a\u000aNeurosis - Souls At Zero\u000a\u000aMekong Delta - Heartbeat\u000a\u000aOpeth - Under The Weeping Moon\u000a\u000aDevin Townsend - Seventh Wave\u000a\u000aQueensryche - Revolution Calling\u000a\u000aAnacrusis - Sound The Alarm\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aI tried to keep it under ten minutes. Thanks for nothing, Opeth.
p7370
aVHaha, awesome! Gonna add these to the list for sure. I was confused for a second but then remembered that Veil of Maya got their name from the Cynic song. I appreciate your help.\u000a\u000aAlso, I should be shot for forgetting Neurosis (at least Scott's in Crack the Skye, though) and Opeth.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I'm sorry, but I might not be including Death. I understand they were progressive as hell, and completely fucking amazing, but they just seemed to click better with a different movement. I hope you understand &lt;/3
p7371
aV"bubble dream" by Chon.\u000awe should hit a two birds with one stone with "moonrise" by Sithu Aye and Plini (it was on a collaborative EP they did).\u000aI don't know why Intervals hasn't been included but "Epiphany". I like "obzen" by Meshuggah but I like "New Millennium Cyanide Christ" a lot better.\u000aMaybe some Born of Osirirs, I was thinking "Absolution".\u000aA progressive metal list does need some Rush so I was thinking "YYZ".\u000a 
p7372
aVI love BOO, as well, and I was considering putting Follow the Signs or XIV+Behold, or maybe even Automatic Motion.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Holy shit, Intervals! They totally slipped my mind. I think I'll go with Tapestry from their first album, but I'm not sure what to use from their second album.
p7373
aVI for one cannot wait to listen to this playlist! \u000a\u000a\u000aAs for Plini might I suggest [Selinium Forest](http://youtu.be/5fNhD_lP1F4) \u000a\u000aAnd for Dream Theater [Panic Attack](http://youtu.be/5hDs6mCVAKs)\u000a\u000a*Edit: I love Opeth and Orchid and Under The Weeping Moon as need much as the next person, but is that really the best song we can think of to represent their sound and get people into them? Maybe [The Leper Affinity](http://youtu.be/9xRPG0-qVks) or [Reverie/Harlequin Forest](http://youtu.be/nIo3lpXrc5A) \u000a\u000aAlso, can we add both Maudlin of the Well and David Maxim Micic to the list? [The Blue Ghost/Shedding Qliphoth](http://youtu.be/S2lEROcrYjc) by Maudlin is breathtaking. As is [Smile](http://youtu.be/6LZ40VkdHuI) by Micic. :) 
p7374
aVI think Maudlin of the Well was already suggested, so like I've already said about ninety times in this thread, I'll consider it for sure. I think I'll stick with Pull Me Under for DT, but I'll definitely add some other songs by them into the list. As for Opeth, same. And thanks for the Plini suggestion! I haven't heard many for them.
p7375
aVHere's some:\u000a\u000aSikTh\u000a\u000aMeshuggah\u000a\u000aThe Contortionist\u000a\u000aCynic\u000a\u000aLast Chance to Reason\u000a\u000aVildhjarta

aVExotic Animal Petting Zoo and The Safety Fire.\u000a\u000aI do not believe Chon belongs up there.
p7381
aVThanks for the suggestions! I've opted to keep Chon, since they seem to be a popular choice in this sub, although I personally do not listen to them very much myself. Safety Fire is great, though, and I'll probably put Exotic Animal Petting Zoo up there because I know they have some fans here.
p7382
aVSome extra song suggestions since you asked:\u000a\u000aMonuments - I, the Creator (if you're going for new, if you want older I suggest Degenerate ^or ^both...)\u000a\u000aSikth - Hold my Finger\u000a\u000aGlasscloud - She is Well and Nothing Can Be Ill\u000a\u000aAnup Sastry - Nemesis\u000a\u000aThese are songs that I find to be high quality, and representative of those bands while not being their most popular. Hope it helps.
p7383
aVYou're awesome :)\u000a\u000aI just started listening to Monuments, but wasn't so sure if I wanted something from The Amanuensis or maybe a little older, so I'll take your word on that second suggestion. Thanks so much!
p7384
aVFor Porcupine Tree - either Trains or Blackest Eyes for newcomers.\u000a\u000a
p7385
aVThanks! I was going to go for Anesthize, but it *is* quite long. Trains is awesome (PT is awesome in general, but you know what I mean).
p7386
aVIt's a tough choice. I once made an into to progressive rock mix CD.... let me dig up the list. 
p7387
aVOkay, so I lied about going to bed right now, and I'm going to reply to you. I'll probably hit the lights before you find it, so thanks in advance and I'm anxious to see that list tomorrow morning :D

p7391
aVGlad you enjoyed!  They did 4 albums, a handful of EPs and a live collection that is absolutely must-have. Unfortunately, they self-destructed a few years ago and are no longer together.  Quite possibly my favorite band noone has heard.  No two albums are alike!

aVGet some Fellsilent in there! Oh, and Cloudkicker!
p7397
aVBands I think are missing from the list: \u000a\u000a* Pain of Salvation\u000a* Persefone\u000a* Pan.Thy.Monium\u000a* Ayreon\u000a* Orphaned Land\u000a* Sigh\u000a* Kayo Dot\u000a* Maudlin of the Well\u000a* Sleepytime Gorilla Museum\u000a* Unexpect
p7398
aVYo, I'll be honest, I only know Ayreon, Unexpect, and Pain of Salvation out of that list. But I'll see if this gets some positive feedback and I'll definitely consider throwing them in. Any song recs for those bands?
p7399
aVDifficult to pick tracks, but here are some recommendations:\u000a\u000a* [Persefone - Consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_LtFlqBtuU) (Unfortunately split into two tracks on Spotify.)\u000a\u000a* [Pan.Thy.Monium - Thee-Perenth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfPKfHpaZyY) (A very underrated band. One of the first progressive death metal bands ever, doing some really proggy stuff in the early 90s.)\u000a\u000a* [Orphaned Land - Halo Dies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xgxQR78wM) (A very unique Israeli band mixing progressive metal and middle eastern folk music.)\u000a\u000a* [Sigh - Equale I) Prelude II) Fugato III) Coda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVkQzE8vsVE)(Probably Japan's most famous experimental/prog metal band.)\u000a\u000a* [Kayo Dot - The Manifold Curiosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik-Fp2defYk)\u000a\u000a* [Maudlin of the Well - Secret Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnLX1y2G8-w)\u000a\u000a* [Sleepytime Gorilla Museum - Babydoctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7FeVPoMlC0)\u000a\u000aThere are loads of other great bands one could add too of course. These are just some of the ones I missed the most.
p7400
aVOkay, I'll check these out for sure! Going to start assembling a playlist on Spotify now, so I'll add these in as I get the chance to listen to them.
p7401
aV[Chon - Fluffy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEsdAIQwphE) has been one of my favourites from them :)
p7402
aVThanks! I believe this one was already suggested, too, so I'll take it into serious consideration!
p7403
aVSkyharbor - Allure
p7404
aVI've heard that one. I think I'll use it.
p7405
aVI nominate Rush's FULL 2112 Suite , The Odyssey by Symphony X and if you want a longer song by Dream Theater then I nominate DT's Octavarium  
p7406
aVI was actually going for shorter, newcomer-friendly songs as an intro to prog. But thank you for your suggestion anyway.
p7407
aVOk then , how bout Another Day or The Answer Lies Within or even The Dark Eternal Night
p7408
aVI don't agree with A Wolf Among Ravens for After The Burial. I'd recommend Pennyweight or Neo Soul because they have a bit more variety.  Although, that's only my opinion. Cool list, none the less!\u000a\u000aAlso, I'd recommend Dysphoria (or the weather front song from Subsume if you want something newer) for Cloudkicker. 
p7409
aVHarken: Atlas Stone. Visions and Pareidolia\u000a\u000aCynic: Veil of maya, Carbon-based anatomy, Integral Birth\u000a\u000aChon: Bubble dream, Dew, Fluffy\u000aThose are my suggestions!\u000a\u000aAlso! I'd suggest some The Mars Volta aswell! Goliath, Cotopaxi, Roulette Dares(the haunt of)\u000a\u000aEdit: Formatting.
p7410
aVMars Volta is going for up for sure, and I already have Veil of Maya for Cynic. Thanks for your other suggestions, though, I didn't really have anywhere to start with Chon!
p7411
aVI've noticed a couple of mentions of Karnivool but no one's suggested any songs. \u000aI think either Themata or New Day. \u000aThemata is a bit less progressive but is a good introduction to the band but I think New Day, as a song, has everything.
p7412
aVThanks! I'm not much of a Karnivool listener, so the suggestions are appreciated.
p7413
aVI'd say New day, Themata and We Are. :)
p7414
aVI'd throw a few more in:\u000a\u000a**Distorted Harmony** - Kono Yume\u000a\u000a**Caligula's Horse** - A Gift To Afterthought\u000a\u000a**The Mars Volta** - Day Of The Baphomets\u000a\u000a**Pain Of Salvation** - A Trace Of Blood\u000a\u000a**Riverside** - Second Life Syndrome\u000a\u000a**Seventh Wonder** - Welcome To Mercy Falls\u000a\u000aEach song is the one that got me into the band so for that reason I think they'd all be good picks. Especially Caligula's Horse, I reaaally like that one right now
p7415
aVI'll definitely throw in Caligula's Horse, Riverside, and Pain of Salvation. I'm not sure about the other bands, though.
p7416
aVMan Distorted Harmony is definitely worth the listen. Kono Yume is what got me into them, and their album they released last year was really well done. Every Time She Smiles is one of their new album or As One. 
p7417
aVChimpspanner - [Under One Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNJBYW2SKjQ)\u000a\u000aWould you guys stretch to The Mars Volta at all? I know it's not strictly 'prog-metal, but I love [Viscera Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4K_PHn21dc)
p7418
aVMars Volta is prog enough for most of us in here, so I'd say yes.
p7419
aVRed Seas Fire - Cypher\u000a\u000aSithu Aye - Hypatia\u000a\u000aThese songs in my opinion show case these artists the best.
p7420
aVI love Cypher! RSF's first album was as good as debuts get.
p7421
aVAre we limiting it to one per artist? Seems a bit restrictive when a lot of artists have such phenomenal discographies.
p7422
aVNo. I'm just not very good at updating every artist with YouTube links when I'm ultimately trying to make a Spotify playlist. I'm going to consider 1-3 songs for each artist with a few exceptions.
p7423
aVSome suggestions I have are:\u000a\u000aMore examples of Meshuggah since they are such founding fathers to the genre and have so much material. On top of Obzen I would add a track off Contradictions Collapse [(Humiliative?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAPn8Jz6qL8) and one off Koloss [(Demiurge?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xD-KJSjIxw).\u000a\u000aSomething by [The Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7y1ZYFODw).\u000a\u000aAnd maybe some [Deftones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTPn4Jlrjb0) for being prog-pioneers as well.
p7424
aVI'll for sure get some more Meshuggah on there. I've been super-busyish over the last couple days and will update the playlist ASAP.
p7425
aVI don't know if I would consider them prog, perhaps more stoner/sludge power trio rock, but they have a ton of prog tendencies, so I'm going to go with it.\u000a\u000aIf King's X is prog-metal, so is this.  (And I love King's X.)\u000a\u000a[Amplifier - Interglacial Spell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klUupS7GcpA)
p7426
aV* Sithu Aye - Arrow + Knee = Adventure Over\u000a* Chimp Spanner - Terminus pt I &amp; II &amp; III\u000a* Ne Obliviscaris - As Icycles Fall\u000a* Cynic - Carbon-Based Anatomy\u000a* Cloudkicker - Our Crazy Night\u000a* Dream Theater - The Bigger Picture\u000a* Between The Buried And Me - Astral Body\u000a* The Contortionist - Oscillator\u000a* Soilwork - Distortion Sleep\u000a* Gojira - World To Come
p7427
aVThanks! I already picked a couple songs for Gojira, but I must admit I totally overlooked From Mars to Sirius on that list. It's hard to choose with one's favorite band :(\u000a\u000aI picked songs already for BTBAM, The Contortionist, and Cynic, but I'll definitely take some of those suggestions once I have a chance to listen to them.
p7428
aVMastodon- Divinations or Blood and Thunder\u000a\u000aAnciients- Giants\u000a\u000aHacride- Awakening or Lazarus\u000a\u000aNero di Marte- Clouded Allure or Time Dissolves\u000a\u000aLeprous- Cryptogenic Desires, Bilateral or Bury\u000a\u000aThe Ocean- Firmament\u000a\u000aCorelia- Treetops\u000a\u000aFair to Midland- Amarillo Sleeps on My Pillow\u000a\u000a
p7429
aVI got Treetops, and I went with Crack the Skye for Mastodon since it's a very good introductory song to the band. Thank you for the other suggestions.
p7430
aVDestiny Potato: Indifferent\u000a\u000aTesseract: April or Eden (1.0)\u000a\u000aChimp Spanner: Cloud City\u000a\u000aCHON: Bubble Dream\u000a\u000aMeshuggah: Rational Gaze\u000a\u000aHelix Nebula: Temple\u000a\u000aTool: Lateralus\u000a\u000aAAL: On Impulse\u000a\u000aPlini: Atlas or Opening\u000a\u000aRed Seas Fire: Skye
p7431
aVI have a few of these already. Chose a couple songs I think showcase AAL brilliantly in both technical ability and catchiness (a lot of people hate on AAL for being "music for musicians", and it kills my soul). Thanks!
p7432
aVI tried choosing the songs I think are good representatives of the band and that aren't the hardest songs to get into (that's why On Impulse)
p7433
aVI'll probably add it; I don't have much from AAL's self-titled.

But I've never seen any "recommend me new shit" sorts of threads on here, and I want people to hear them! Maybe you can help :)\u000a\u000aOh, and Anup Sastry wants to work with them on their new album.  So they've got that going for them too :)

p7490

VDefinitely check out Sikth.
p7492
aVIre works is my favorite Dillinger album as well! They're definitely one of those bands that sort of walks a line between progressive metal and a more hardcore punk sound.\u000a\u000aI'd check out Protest the Hero (insane guitarwork and excellent vocals), Converge (mathy hardcore, very little clean vocals, but definitely one of Dillinger's heavier influences), and Exotic Animal Petting Zoo (especially their album "I Have Made My Bed in Darkness;" weird ass guitar effects and a good mixture of heaviness and softness).\u000a\u000aBased on your favorite Dillinger tracks and your other suggestions, it seems like you might like more straightforward metaly stuff. Try Hark, I've been jamming them a lot recently.
p7493
aVOmigosh! I'm listening to PTH: Volition right now and I already really like Rody's vocals. I'll check out the other recs as well! Thanks.
p7494
aVHell yeah. I'm just suggesting shit as it comes to me, so if you're a fan of that vocal style, you may enjoy The Fall of Troy (I'd recommend the album Doppelganger) and Coheed and Cambria.\u000a\u000aAnother that just came to me is The Human Abstract. Their album Nocturne is beautiful. 
p7495
aVi'm gonna suggest some noisier stuff that might fall more into the range of mathcore than progmetal, but they're the bands that i know of that are similar to DEP\u000a\u000aThe Hirsch Effekt is probably the most similar that i know of. [Fixum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPtyCR8S3S0). [Absenz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfBiPXtLTrQ). they've got a pretty diverse sound and go all in between slow/melodic and crazy/noisy.\u000a\u000aPsyopus has a bit less range (pacing-wise, at least) and is more consistently noisy, but they're just as experimental and mind blowing as DEP. [The Pig Keeper's Daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIiYwKO88aY). [X and Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSVOBHtm0r0).\u000a\u000aThe Crinn - [Meat Eating Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqN8Gupjc4g) (note that the video uploader accidentally repeated the song,  it's not actually that long)\u000a\u000aAn Isle Ate Her - [Easy, Charles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi-0_9fV_Gk). this one's got weird vocals, but i personally think the music is worth getting used to them.\u000a\u000aCar Bomb - [This Will Do the Job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4nBM8MtX-g). oooh, trippy album art.\u000a\u000aokay, i've heard that Botch is really similar to DEP but i've never really listened to them, so i looked them up. and yeah, i think you'll like em. [Transitions from Persona to Object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Q87LFycXI). they're new to me, and i'm really digging it.\u000a\u000alastly, these guys aren't very similar to DEP, but i saw that you were enjoying Protest the Hero. if you like them then check out [Raiju](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcjup4uxzEQ).
p7496
aVPsyopus might take some getting used to, but it's sooo worth it. Fucking Arp is an alien.
p7497
aVNo one has recommended Toothgrinder? [They just released an EP and music video not to long ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3PagrocKk). They are a recent hidden band that needs to explode in popularity. The first thing that comes to mind is DEP when I listen to them but they are just *really* good.
p7498
aVBest EP since Hunab Ku's rewiring process
p7499
aVEdit: Added more bands I've enjoyed. \u000a
p7500
aVSomeone else recommended [Botch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brqZ6jZiOFE), which I would second. They aren't as dynamic as DEP, nor do they sing much, plus 90s metalcore production can get kind of claustrophobic, but they're truly an awesome band. It might sound a little dense or lacking in range at first, but over time you'll pick out what makes them so legendary.  \u000a  \u000aMy other recommendation would be [Intronaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVcxDsY3vv4). The vocals are all in the throat and depending on where you are in their discography, they range from growls to yelling to singing. They're usually lumped in with Mastodon and Baroness and though they don't have a Southern rock sound, they should bring something to the table that you'll enjoy.
p7501
aVDillinger are my favorite band alongside Meshuggah. So obviously I listen to lots of music that have "similar" styles. Even better when they have influences from both those bands.\u000a\u000aSome of my favorite "mathy" bands are Botch, Converge, Sikth, The Safety Fire, Equal Minds Theory, Torrential Downpour, Toothgrinder, Exotic Animal Petting Zoo, Car Bomb, Psyopus, Rolo Tomassi, Destrage, See You Next Tuesday(Psyopus with more Death Metal/Grindcore), Dionaea, The Crinn, Carnivores At Grace, Every Time I Die(southern influenced), The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza, Sectioned, Cave In, Protest The Hero, Enabler, The Chariot, Coalesce, Ion Dissonance, Hunab Ku...\u000a\u000aI hope that was helpful :D There are some more heavy and some less heavy bands in there. some with southern influence, some more hardcore, some more metal, but all very good in my opinion

p7534
aVMist- Volition\u000a\u000aI feel as though the song sums up what PTH is in essence. From its punk rock influences to the marching melodies that get stuck in your head. The song has a lot of heart and that's what the band is all about. (At least that's what I've always felt.)

The guest vocals done by Kayla are very well executed and fit in wonderfully with Rody's voice. Finally, BRING ON THE STORM, BRING ON THE RAIN, BRING ON THE JESTERS AND BRING ON THE PAIN! Need I say more? 
p7542
aVPreeeeetty sure it's Jesters instead of Justice if I remember the lyrics correctly but either way that part kicks ass! 
p7543
aVOh, you are correct sir, thank you!
p7544
aVHer guest vocals on this song (and the others on Volition) are absolutely perfect.
p7545
aVThe female vocals on this song are done by Kayla Howran, not Jadea. I'm pretty sure this is the only song she sings on, but seriously killer part.
p7546
aVYou're right. I've looked her up before, she's a country singer apparently. I was hoping she'd be in a more indie rock type band which I think I'd quite enjoy. 
p7547
aV**Dunsel** - Scurrilous\u000a\u000aProtest the Hero's musical expression of their journey in the music industry and their discovery of its greedy grasp on creative freedom. Heartfelt lyrics with beautiful instrumentation. 
p7548
aV**The Dissentience** - Fortress\u000a\u000aThough it could be argued that such praise is par for the course regarding PTH, The Dissentience is a prime example of their incredible riff and melody work, and is a stand-out for it's evocative lyrics. The last verse with the little break before Rody's final scream is chill-inducing.\u000a
p7549
aVHair Trigger - Scurrilous\u000a\u000aThis is a very personal PTH song, that has been their most essential driving quality throughout the years. Serious riffs and you know when you first figured out the meaning you read the lyrics 10 times. This song finishes with the most uncomparable mind numbing guest vocals from Jadea Kelly that has to be noted as their best with lyrics like, "frozen, dripping, holiday bird."
p7550
aVDunsel - Scurrilous\u000a\u000aWhile not as flashy as a lot of their songs, Dunsel is an important part of PTH's discography. The song feels a lot more controlled than their previous work, showing how the band has matured during their time as a band. Lyrically the sing is rather straightforward, but lays out some of their feelings towards the music industry, feelings which would later lead them to move to crowd funding for their next album. 
p7551
aVI agree with this one, obviously.
p7552
aVI love this one! 
p7553
aV**Bury the Hatchet** - Kezia\u000a\u000aRody evokes the rawest emotion of the whole album during this song (IMO), speaking from the perspective of the prison guard. His interleaving screams perfectly punctuate the guard's violent outbursts, backed by some of the heaviest guitar work on the album. This song stands out from many others on the album which, despite telling their part of a coherent narrative, tend to sound a bit "samey", stylistically speaking.
p7554
aV**The Divine Suicide of K.** - Kezia\u000a\u000aThis is the last song in the section of Kezia that tells the story from our hero whom the album is named after. Next to *Turn Soonest to the Sea*, this song has the best lyrics on the album, and some of the best by Protest the Hero amongst their entire works. The song ties up everyone's perspectives together, referring to them all directly as well as a reference to *Blindfolds Aside*. The song ends in yet another fantastic vocal contribution by Jadea Kelly, wrapping up everything beautifully tragically. *The Divine Suicide of K.* best humanizes Kezia, allowing the listener to connect with her one more time before her execution. \u000a\u000aSeriously, why has no one made this album a movie or musical? It's begging to be made!
p7555
aVI don't think you can call her a hero, more of a victim. \u000a\u000aGreat song though!
p7556
aVSkies - Volition\u000a\u000aThis song is all over the place, constantly introducing new riffs and sections, as well as different singers throughout. If there was ever to be a song to really capture Luke and Tim's skill, this is it.
p7557
aVNot to mention the story telling. Everytime I hear this song I can just picture the scene in my head. All coming full circle by reminding you that all you need is your friends and those close to you, and you can overcome any adversity.\u000aThis one has my vote.
p7558
aVA Plateful Of Our Dead - Kezia\u000a\u000aThis song is a perfect and innovative end to a concept album, having the band finish a story with their own perspective. The lyrics, riffs, and punkish melodies are impecable and really make you think with some large metaphors. It also ends with a beautiful instrumental piece. 
p7559
aVThe "if I believed in meat" line prompted me to look up and find out that they're all vegetarians. Pretty awesome.
p7560
aV**Skies**\u2014Volition\u000a\u000aThis and Tool's Lateralus are my two favorite metal songs ever written. It features a phenomenal blend of style, from a clean intro displaying Rody's gorgeous vocal skill to an absurdly technical riff showcasing Tim and Luke's precision to a couple of ultra-mathy and proggy bridges, and wraps it all up with one of the most satisfying conclusions in all of music. The long low E that fades out at the end of the song wraps up the album perfectly. Overall, one of the most diverse, brilliant songs, which represents both their varying styles and their brilliantly cohesive overall songwriting.

p7563
aV**Underbite** - Volition\u000a\u000aLike "Dunsel" from the previous album, this song addresses the band's grievances with the music industry, but instead of denouncing the corporate big-wigs, this one attacks the artists who are just trying to make money and don't actually care about their music or fans. PtH are known for caring a great deal about both, so it makes sense that Rody has so many powerful things to say on the subject. Not to mention the music is top-notch.
p7564
aV**Heretics and Killers** - Kezia\u000a\u000aThis is the first demonstration of what PTH was capable of when they started out. Fast, melodic up and down riffs, tight rhythmic backing with power chords and octaves, and slithering call-and-response arpeggios at the end between Luke and Tim that are pristine. Moe's odd-time signature changes, mixed with punk-influenced snare hits, guide you through the changing paces and sudden stop-starts that PTH utilize throughout Kezia and onward. Arif's bass slaps and pops at the beginning grabs your ear and reminds you that you cannot simply count him as 'another' bassist. Lastly, Rody's highs and lows are on point adding just the right amount of raw emotion and tenacity. The lyrics being belted out are complemented well by growling and a street-gang like yelling from the backup vocals. This song set the stage for Kezia and sets a very high standard for the rest of the bands discography, which does not disappoint. \u000a\u000aEdit: Shit, not 2-3 sentences. It stays.
p7565
aVBone Marrow - Fortress\u000a\u000aThere's quite a lot to talk about with Bone Marrow. Rody's vocals are on point, the way he alternates between raspy screams and very full melodic vocals is really pleasing to listen to, and this song is the best example of how he can blend the two into the same section so seamlessly. The song goes from this real driving rhythm, to a slow dirge, to a mid-paced stomp, and finally to an instrumental piano section, and yet it works, and is a good example of Protest's style of through-composition, which is the main component of their music that has helped them stand out from everyone else.
p7566
aVTandem - Scurrilous\u000a\u000aThis one is terribly well written. It's about cancer and how we deal with it inside and out. Standing by someone who is fighting and fighting with them. The last verse of the song is just beautiful. 
p7567
aV[deleted]
p7568
aV[deleted]
p7569
aVBlindfolds Aside - Kezia\u000a\u000aThis song brilliantly wraps up the soldier's POV section of the album. It exhibits both the frantic feeling/pace that pervades much of the album along with the emotion inherent in the lyrics, and blends them well. It is a great showcase for the band's instrumental and lyrical talents, especially at such a young age. \u000a\u000a
p7570
aVKezia was such a good album, but unfortunately I don't think a lot of people have realized this. I hope this track gets support it's my favorite off the album.
p7571
aV[deleted]
p7572
aV **She Who Mars the Skin of Gods** - Kezia\u000a\u000aEvery part is own amazing piece all working together. It keeps you engaged the entire time, and wraps up with a great appearance from Jadea Kelly.
p7573
aV[deleted]
p7574
aVClarity - Volition\u000a\u000aWhile some PTH fans probably dislike the song because of its more accessible sound, it's personally one of my favorites. Phenomenal songwriting and a really neat opening riff. Plenty of my friends that want to get into PTH or prog metal in general have asked me who to check out, and this song has topped the list every time.
p7575
aVTurn Soonest to the Sea - Kezia\u000a\u000aThis song has some of the same riffage going on in the rest of the album, but one thing makes it stand over the rest: the ending. When "MAYBE SOMEDAY" kicks in, the song reaching a whole new level of mind-shatteringly awesome. It's just a beautiful, powerful end to a phenomenal song.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, as /u/AsylumPlagueRat mentioned, the lyrics for this song are amazing. It's a feminist anthem of sorts, and it's totally badass. \u000a\u000a&gt;I'll know our city is in ruins when our greatest source of pride \u000a\u000a&gt;is a monument of dicks and ribs and the gender crown we wore\u000a\u000aThat's just amazing stuff right there, folks.
p7576
aVYou got my vote!
p7577
aVThis song has my vote, but this song has some of the best musicianship this band had to offer. And the lyrics and vocals are so awesome.
p7578
aVYeah, absolutely, the whole song is killer. The end stands out to me, though.\u000a\u000aForgot to mention the lyrics though, they're a big boon to this one.
p7579
aVI'm gonna make a strange comparison, but when everyone starts singing "Maybe someday..." it reminded me of Les Miserables when they sing Do You Hear the People Sing. I think it's the most powerful moment on the entire album.
p7580
aVThat or the gnarly break from Divinity Within!
p7581
aV**Bloodmeat** - Fortress\u000a\u000aAs one of their most popular - if not *the* most popular song, Bloodmeat instantly draws you in with the iconic intro rhythm that sets the tone for the rest of the song. In its relatively short timespan of just under 4 minutes, it covers a lot of ground and rarely repeats itself, making it a welcome listen after hundreds of plays.
p7582
aVDA DA DADA DA DA DA DADADAooooooooohhhhhh
p7583
aVThis is the only song ever that gives me tingles every time I listen to it no matter how many times I listen to it.
p7584
aVSex Tapes - Scurrilous\u000a\u000aThis song has some of the coolest riffage from all four of their albums. It epitomizes the great tapping riffs paired with rhythm that Luke has been pulling off! It has strong blues references, and is an overall amazing song.\u000a\u000a(Or we could just put all of Fortress on it)
p7585
aVSequoia Throne - Fortress\u000a\u000aTechnically one of the most difficult songs to play, but nothing feels like it was put in for the sole purpose of being flashy. The lyrics are fairly thought-provoking and intelligent, Rody absolutely kills the vocals. This song most sums up what PTH do and do well.
p7586
asVKarnivool + The Contortionist North American Tour leak!
p7587
(lp7588
VOh fuck yes
p7589
aVIf this is real than my life has officially reached it's climax. Holy shit. 
p7590
aVPersonally, I think Karnivool is one of the best bands to come out of the last decade of music.. possibly even longer than that.  Surprisingly though, I've tried to introduce many friends to them with similar musical interests, with little success.  Their loss, I suppose.
p7591
aVIt might be because you're hyping them up a bit too much.\u000a\u000aI mean they're good... but ya...
p7592
aVWhen I introduce a band to someone I try and leave my own opinions out of the conversation.  I can hype them all I want on a website where at least one or two other people are most likely going to agree with me though.
p7593
aVFor what they are I mean I agree that they're the best thing at what they are....since Tool.  I mean they're basically Tool.\u000a\u000aThe Contortionist on the other hand, was pretty boring on the BTBAM Parallax tour when I saw them.  If it was with someone else I'd probably go and see it, I really enjoy Karnivool.
p7594
aVI've been a fan of Kanivool for years but never had the opportunity to see them live since I live in Ohio.  I've heard very good things about their live performances so to me it wouldn't matter much who the openers are.  The Contortionist I can't say I'm a fan of, but their recent album I think is really interesting, much more so than their previous efforts, which were basically just scream-only djent albums with slightly more rhythmic complexity than the average.\u000a\u000aOn a side note, I get where the comparisons to Tool originate, but I hear a lot of people compare bands to Tool simply because Tool doesn't fit into any traditional category of music, and neither do Karnivool.  I simply don't seem to hear as much similarities in their music as some do.  I don't compare any band to Tool, really.  Tool is Tool.  Hopefully they grace our ears with another album sometime this decade.
p7595
aVThat is a very unfortunate opinion of TC's first two albums.
p7596
aVI have never been able to appreciate Tool, yet I am an enormous fan of the 'Vool.\u000a\u000aI am broken, I know.
p7597
aVYou are not alone. I like a couple Tool songs but for the most part I find that they're being complex just for the sake of being complex and that a lot of their discography is just a mess of sound in odd time signatures and isn't particularly meaningful. Karnivool may have the *sound* of Tool with the beautiful guitar work and driving bass, but 'Vool has meaning and purpose to the complexity of their songs. Also Ian Kenny.
p7598
aVI hope they have a show in Toronto!
p7599
aVThey need to play through sound awake and assymetry in their entirety.\u000a\u000aOr I need to go to every single show on this tour.\u000a\u000aBoth.

p7613
aVYup. The app Songkick on my phone buzzed this morning to alert me of a DC show on March 19th. The venue is listed as Markthalle Hamburg which I have no fucking clue about. 
p7614
aVWooooo I'm seeing them in Manchester! Also seen the contortionist with protest the hero twice!
p7615
aVI reallyyy hope they're coming by Québec City, but the fact that The Contortionist is already touring here in February has me worried that it's not going to be the case. Oh well, everything is possible i guess. I'd walk to Montréal in a heartbeat to see those fuckers anyway.

asVCity in the Sea - The Ocean [Off one of their heavier albums, Aeolian]
p7625
(lp7626
VOne of my favorite bands around.  Pelagial was my album of the year in 2013.  These guys stayed at my cousin's house during the summer slaughter, good times were had.  
p7627
aVSounds like an awesome time, I saw them live before and they were one of the best live performances from a band I've ever seen. Too bad they were only opening, their songs are so long and epic they only managed to fit 3 or 4 in the time they had.
p7628
aVYea man it was wild. Each band on summer slaughter only had a measly 25 minutes set. So, night before, Robin and the band are telling us that Robin has been having technical issues on his equipment on this tour but they've figured it out. Sure enough, they only play 2 songs because of said issues. That part sucked but I can't complain since I got to hang out and party with one of my favorite bands for two days non stop. They made up for it when they headlined and played pelagial in its entirety on the next tour.
p7629
aVDoood I'm jealous you got to experience that. Gonna definitely be looking out for their shows. Idk if they've ever headlined a tour in Canada but to see them rock a proper setlist would be epic..
p7630
aVI really like their [epic, more melodic stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndQP7CQoiw), but I still feel like their heavier energetic stuff [is still top notch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzlIyY_Jwig). The composition and diversity these guys show is incredible.

asVAnd So I Watch You From Afar - A Little Bit of Solidarity Goes a Long Way
p7632
(lp7633
VThe overly long title gives it away that this is more along the lines of noisy postrock, but AWIWYFA has always been a bit of a grey area for me, since they're energetic enough and occasionally heavy enough, if it was mixed a bit differently could sound like metal. The mix on their second album 'Gangs' was even closer, especially the drums, such as on [Search:Party:Animal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFXcfEQ2Gv0), which has a great groove.\u000a\u000aReally I just wanted to post this because it's probably in my "Top 5 songs in 5" (ha!) list, right up there with [Vicarious by Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOKV9Stri_M).
p7634
aVI think post-rock can fit comfortably in a few different genres, depending on their style.  I certainly enjoy this album.
p7635
aVI enjoyed it, thanks for sharing.

p7643
aVI haven't delved too deep into Black Metal yet I've only enjoyed around 6 bands from what I've heard. I don't think this is for me, as it felt uneventful and slow. Perhaps that's what it's supposed to be, but as it stands this song didn't do it for me :(
p7644
aVWhat kinds of black metal bands do you like? Like you said, this is probably not for you, as to me the song is the opposite of uneventful. I think it's more prog than black overall though, so yes, it does have quite a few slow sections.
p7645
aVXanthochroid and Ihsahn really stood out to me for black metal however it seems I'm more into Extreme Prog over Black, but I don't mind some of it. 
p7646
aVFair enough.
p7647
aVYeah it took me a while to get into black metal. I'm still not a huge fan of it, but I found that I was more into the atmospheric black metal. Bands like Winterfylleth and Fen hooked me right away. Ne Obliviscaris made me appreciate black metal vocals a little bit more as well. I think it's more of an acquired taste.

aVOh man, such a wonderful journey. I'm glad you're enjoying it :)
p7652
aVDude, yeah. Just finished reading / listening through the whole thing.... it's insane. All these references to the Night Owls and the Prospects throughout BTBAM's discography. I've listened to all their albums' countless times, but with the story to Parallax II sorta explained it's even better. This idea of "Night Owls" watching over us and predicting our futures is creepy as fuck, too.... especially at midnight haha. \u000a\u000aThe whole album creates really interesting (and at times creepy) images and appearances for these characters and places in my mind. A really interesting story, wow. Really sweet stuff. \u000a\u000aAlso interesting is (the 2 year old, but whatever) comments where people are like "what if this...." or "I think...." and go in a completely different direction than the write up.\u000a\u000aFantastic music and story telling. I'm blown away.
p7653
aV&gt; Fantastic music and story telling. I'm blown away.\u000a\u000a100% how I feel.\u000a\u000aIf you like horror movies, The Fourth Kind is about as close to a cinematic representation of the Night Owls as you'll find.
p7654
aVI'll check it out, thanks
p7655
aVI didn't even know Isolate was a concept album. I knew that the Great Escape *song* was a story, but I didn't think album was a concept album either.
p7656
aVI didn't either for a time! Isolate is a concept album about one man's battle against insanity. Totally interesting!\u000a\u000aAnd The Great Escape isn't technically a concept album, though some songs are independently connected:\u000a\u000a* Long Way Home is the prequel to Alley Cat, involving a protagonist named Jackie who grows up in an abusive household and ends up with co-dependency issues.\u000a\u000a* King of Whitewater is about a Swedish legend of a river sprite that lures people in with violin music and then murders them...\u000a\u000a* Angelmaker is about a woman who ran an orphanage for profit and horribly mistreated the kids.\u000a\u000a* Move on Through is about how music helps people cope with life.\u000a\u000a* Wiseman is about a man predicting what will happen in The Great Escape.\u000a\u000a* The Great Escape is about humanity bailing on the Earth they destroyed, flying into space to their death. Basically Wall-E, but with the opposite ending.
p7657
aVI guess thinking back to Isolate now, it makes sense. I never listened to it looking for a story, but in songs like A Darkened Mind, Abyss, Mouth of Madness, that is incredibly obvious. The whole album actually matches up with that plot but those songs came to mind instantly. 
p7658
aVPersefone's Spiritual Migration has an instrumental final track, it basically reiterates much of the thematic and motivic material throughout the album in kind of an anti-overture. I think it's kind of a representation of the cycle of life and death that is sort of discussed in the album, as the album speaks about the concept of *samsara* prevalent in many Asian religions. 
p7659
aVLove that album (and song)!
p7660
aVHm, I'll need to listen back through that album. I adore it for the music, but I admit I've never really dug into the lyrics. Good thoughts!
p7661
aVAnd don't forget "Core", which is a clear concept album, with one story told from three intertwining angles. I love it just as much as "Spiritual Migration"!
p7662
aVWow, I can't believe I stopped at shin-ken and SM...Persefone is an incredible band, and I now require Core in my life.
p7663
aVWhat's interesting to me is how The Contortionist's album **Exoplanet** ends. \u000a\u000a\u2022 "This extra solar vessel, orbiting the cluster.\u000aEjects the sample pods of the Eden passengers.\u000aAs for us, we must migrate.\u000aThis exoplanet has failed."\u000a\u000a- Exoplanet III: Light\u000a\u000aIt's obvious the passengers failed their objective. The songs title is Light however. Light is supposed to benevolent, yet they fail? What's next? And the undulating pulse at the end is ominous and eerie. Is it a beacon? An SOS to the pods or the colony? A beacon not shut off at the colony, that says, "Exoplanet is A-OK, colony is thriving" that will doom future comers? Such a poignant way to end a concept record.\u000a\u000aAnother TC album, **Intrinsic** centers around a fabricated dream realm, and the main character is being tested on, or is he?\u000a\u000a\u2022 "Sensing a new wave of neuronal presence in the field / Entropic clues\u000atells me this is not a dream / I'm melding into surroundings The terror\u000aand the fear feels as if it's mine alone"\u000a\u000a- Solipsis\u000a\u000aFrom Solipsis, an interesting title. Solipsism is the philosophy that only I exist and everything outside the mind is a fabrication of my mind. The song is short, but brutal, full of awkward time changes. Making it jarring and quick. A reference to the character's thoughts? The next song is an synth-filled track, with bits of vocals saying "I can feel/see". Did he get lost in his mind? Did he create this reality (including the experiments) and now he scrambled his brain and created an existence in stasis? Is he in a stasis because of the dream testing, and now holds the key to creation/God?\u000a

aVReally cool thoughts here!\u000a\u000aI think I need to give The Contortionist another shot. I saw them live with BTBAM and even bought a copy of Intrinsic. Didn't hate it, but didn't really love it either. Everyone here seems to love them, though, so I'll give them a few more spins, as well as checking out Exoplanet and Language.\u000a\u000aFrom your thoughts here, it sounds like there's loads of story and context in their music that I hadn't noticed at all. Thanks for bringing this band back to my attention!
p7665
aVLanguage is a masterpiece, but I can't listen to it as often as the other two. Intrinsic was definitely  sleeper record. While Exoplanet is regarded as their best, and it really has its moments, Intrinsic was never given a fair shake.\u000a\u000aExoplanet is beautiful light music written around lots of heavy passages. The contrast is nice and serves its purpose. It makes the narrative more severe.\u000a\u000aIntrinsic is heavy passages written around pretty music. Different flow. Lighter tone, not enough moshing. Just kidding, it has its brutal moments and because there aren't as meany heavy moments, it amplifies the severity of our character. Makes the brutal parts cooler too.\u000a\u000aAnyways, Intrinsic's story is a little subtle, but is definitely there. Here's what Jon Carpenter said,\u000a\u000a&gt; Intrinsic\u2018s lyrics were aimed to be a science-fiction inspired conceptual storyline. It\u2019s like a handful of puzzle pieces. Instrumentals that have different feels and styles. The Contortionist has always been about contrast, the heaviest and then the most beautiful. This provides a very wide range of emotions to write over. We want the listener to feel the ups and downs and to get engaged in the content. When piecing it all together lyrically\u2026 I wanted the concepts to be present without being overbearing. The fans who go looking for the details will find them and the casual listener can listen to any song and enjoy a small piece of the puzzle. Never leaving the boundaries of the mind, the first five songs range from mind/brain phenomena and reality theories to religion and mind trips. The last five are from the perspective of future patients coping with a shared reality scenario; a narrative on the potential of using technology to achieve a perfect dream you could feel and control with ease. There\u2019s an eerie uncertainty to how a person\u2019s psyche will react to that degree of extended consciousness.\u000a&gt;
p7666
aVAh, so I stumbled on their worst album then. Exoplanet and Language, here I come!
p7667
aVHaha, I wouldn't say that, but as far as fans think, Exo is god tier and Language is a masterpiece. Poor poor Intrinsic. Enjoy! Language is a concept record too, but not a story record really. It's more spiritual and such. Haven't read the lyrics in their entirety yet.
p7668
aVBig fan right here. I think language is the worst. Exoplanet is my favorite by far. Just my opinion though. 
p7669
aV[deleted]
p7670
aVI'm inclined to agree with you. I like it, but Language I and II are pretty ill. Sad that's the best from the record. I was super stoked for it too. Intrinsic is a very close second to Exoplanet, I think. Wish Carpenter could have stayed.

aVMaybe since the Exoplanet failed, they released the sample pods hoping they will be found by someone/something else or land on a different planet? Last ditch effort by them. 
p7675
aVA desperate measure which only makes their end even more weighted. I love it ending like that.
p7676
aVI also did a quick mini-writeup on Exoplanet a while back regarding concept albums and how they tend to "revisit" certain aspects of itself, but from a musical standpoint rather than storytelling.\u000a\u000a**Chord Progressions:**\u000a\u000a* [Contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEE_N0qbAG8&amp;t=16m18s) &amp; [Axiom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEE_N0qbAG8&amp;t=34m07s) (5-note pattern)\u000a\u000a* [Oscillator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEE_N0qbAG8&amp;t=29m45s) &amp; [Exoplanet III-Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEE_N0qbAG8&amp;t=42m40s)  (freefloating ambience, although not *exactly* the same they're very similar to one another and both fit the album perfectly)\u000a\u000a* [Exoplanet I-Egress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEE_N0qbAG8&amp;t=34m49s) &amp; [Exoplanet III-Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEE_N0qbAG8&amp;t=45m13s) (3-note pattern)\u000a\u000a**Lyrics:**\u000a\u000a* Track title references throughout the album outside of their respective songs. (Language put a heavy focus on this one)\u000a\u000a**Themes:**\u000a\u000a* They play around with the number 5 a lot. Examples being the first two I linked up top, the last part of [Vessel's outro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEE_N0qbAG8&amp;t=26m35s), and the beeping during [Light's outro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEE_N0qbAG8&amp;t=47m16s) beeps every 5 seconds. There may be more, but these are the ones I've found.\u000a
p7677
aVI remember reading your comment someplace regarding some of these points.  Haven't noticed the beeping in Vessel, I'll have to give it another listen. Wonder why the pattern 5 is significant.
p7678
aVI posted it in /r/Djent a few months ago right before Language dropped.\u000a\u000aIt could be something significant, then again it could just be a continuity thing.
p7679
aVNice find! That's rather an excellent article and very interesting.\u000a\u000aTo add to the list: I really like the ending of Appearance of Nothing's album "All Gods are Gone". The song is called "The Rise and Fall of Nothing". Unfortunately I don't have a deep analysis of it, I just think it's a great ending. \u000a\u000aI love the contrast between the quick pace and hard drums present throughout the album and the very ominous sounding and slow ending to the whole thing. Also, I'm a total sucker for unsettling sounding piano pieces.
p7680
aVI've never even heard of Appearance of Nothing! Thanks for the recommendation; I love unsettling piano pieces as well :)
p7681
aVOne of my favorite instrumental ending sections is the final few minutes of ["Curator"](https://potmoshetoimos.bandcamp.com/album/maribel) by Potmos Hetoimos, which finishes up a three-album concept suite. There's so much catharsis in that buildup and release. 
p7682
aVThree albums of sludge metal is a huge undertaking...Is it worth it for someone whose only experience with doom/sludge/post is The Ocean?
p7683
aVIt's pretty intense funeral doom (albeit with a lot of creative ideas), so it might be challenging. But if you like The Ocean, you'd probably like the album "The Greater Gospel" instead. 
p7684
aVCool, thanks for the recommendation.
p7685
aVAlso: get into post-metal! Recommendations for more creative stuff:\u000a\u000a* [Burst "Lazarus Bird"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lslvvTnE4QE)\u000a* [Callisto "Noir"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz5tVrA-zzY)\u000a* [Crib45 "Marching Through the Borderlines"](https://crib45.bandcamp.com/track/borderlines)\u000a* [Cult of Luna, basically everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDtTI9ryibc)\u000a* [Inter Arma "The Cavern"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuOuPMXw6xs) \u2013 prog-sludge as good as it gets!\u000a* [Swallow the Sun "Plague of Butterflies"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ANdnf2M7Ek) \u2013 the best epic doom song ever, period
p7686
aVNice! Thank you so much for the suggestions. This sub is fantastic :)
p7687
aVI'm sitting here listening to Plague of Butterflies, which is pretty incredible I might add. 15 minutes had gone by and I'm like "Man, this song is long, wonder what the length is?" Then I actually look at YouTube, and realize I'm barely halfway through it haha. So epic.
p7688
aVYeah dude, it's awesome! I really wish StS made more stuff like that. They have some other great tracks, but nothing this huge. 
p7689
aVNo mention of Isis on here? They're practically the godfathers of prog-post.
p7690
aVIsis is one of my all-time favorite bands, and prog metal is one of my favorite genres, and I respectfully submit that there's virtually nothing prog about them. (CoL is even further from prog, though, to be fair.)
p7691
aVDirewolf : Beyond the Lands of Human Existence is quite interesting.\u000a\u000aAn album filled with space, aliens, intergalactic wars, prophets, psychokinetic powers and all sorts, ends with sounds of war as seen by a civilian, women screaming in terror and a haunting acoustic guitar...\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLUxL6JJuGU#t=2874
p7692
aVThat sounds incredible! Thanks for the recommendation.
p7693
aVThe two clean guitar breaks in Meshuggah's Catch 33 are so well placed. The last one ends the album beautifully. \u000a\u000a\u000aI don't think they mean anything in particular. It's just more of Fredrik's amazing sense of writing contrasting melodies to the intense rhythmic pulse of the music.

p7729
aVThis has got to be the heaviest song Periphery's put out
p7730
aVDepends on what you mean by heavy. It's not very brutal or technical. Just super low tuned to me. Imo, Four Lights is heavy as fuck. 
p7731
aVFour Lights is one of the heaviest moments on the entire album. That and the end of Psychosphere.
p7732
aVThat riffage on Four Light is magnificent!
p7733
aV"It's not very brutal or technical" I think that's the point, at least for me. I consider "heavy" and "brutal" as different categories of extreme metal. For me Meshuggah is the heaviest band but certainly not the most brutal (would probably be some tech death or grindcore? dunno, not something I really listen to)
p7734
aVMost brutal... Dethklok. 
p7735
aVHeavy does not = brutal or technical.
p7736
aVImo it does. Low tuning does not equal heavy. To me, this song lacks vigor to make it their heaviest song put out. I see why people might feel that this is heavy and that is their opinion. It is heavy, it's just not THAT heavy. I just feel the tuning makes it SEEM like it's their heaviest. To each their own.
p7737
aVI don't think low tuning makes something heavy either (though it doesn't hurt). Heaviness is a certain quality stemming from a real hard hitting groove for me. Technicality, while nice at times, certainly doesn't make something heavy IMO. In fact I think too much technicality can ruin a good heavy groove. But too each their own indeed. I love these discussions because everyone feels heaviness as something different.
p7738
aVFor me it's a tossup between this and MK Ultra with Four Lights as a close third. MK Ultra is just so fucking raw. 
p7739
aVI agree, Mr person has always been probably bulbs heaviest song. Mk ultra has also very similar mixing ,it has that punch and raw feel like the original. Rainbow gravity is definitely amongst similar ranks 
p7740
aVThis song gave me a hell below. 
p7741
aVThe music perfectly fits what's going on in the lyrics (If I'm correct, the character in the story is on his descent to Hell).\u000a\u000aThe jazz interlude at the end made it for me though.  It reminds me of elevator music, which also fits in the whole descending feel.
p7742
aVyoutube link got DMCA'd. still seems to be on grooveshark for anybody who has no moral quams stealing music (I don't)
p7743
aVParts of this remind me of the second half of Massamune, which until now I believed to be their heaviest moment.

p7760
aVWell this came out of nowhere... \u000a\u000aI much prefer the 'Gentle' version of the song. The 'Storm' version is honestly probably one of the least interesting things Arjen has written in 15 years or so. It isn't awful, I just had higher hopes for something from him. The good news is the Gentle version sounds very pleasant, and all the parts work well together.
p7761
aVYes, it wasn't bad at any rate but it was way too similar to "Dragon on the Sea".

p7773
(lp7774
VI really dig this album.  I appreciate this song, but I find myself skipping it most of the time.  It's just so over the top it's kinda draining.
p7775
aVThat's why I LOOOOOOVE it. I think this album draws a noticeable influence (mostly this song and "Whatever Makes You Feel Superior") from 80's rock/metal, including some of the ridiculousness of it. This song is just a lot of fun to me, and so enjoyable to jam to.\u000a\u000aThat's why I love the album as a whole, it excels in diversity for sure. You and I Both Lose (But Five Wins) is a very progressive-sounding song, and then it immediately switches to that 80's almost Boston-like sound with the next track. And then you get to What Kind of Creature Am I? And it sounds kind of like Protest the Hero, honestly. That variety gives it strength.
p7776
aVI agree with all that.  And I do actually like this song, just in moderation.
p7777
aVI'm the exact same way. I actually love this song, but I don't ever want to hear it if I'm listening to the full alubm.

I used to always subject him to my music in the car as a teenager which was right about the time I was getting into PT.\u000a\u000aEvery time he has to sit through some tedious meeting he relays to me that he starts hearing this song play in his head as he watches his fellow meeting-goers let their minds drift into oblivion. Gravity eyelids all around the room.

aVI have trouble deciding my favourite of the various headbanging riffs in the PT catalogue. Gravity Eyelids, Way Out Of Here, Arriving Somewhere, Fear Of A Blank Planet. They are all so damn satisfying ;_;

p7826
aVSpeaking of CT, I've always loved the ending lyrics of "Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt." Cedric delivers them so perfectly, and it's such a chilling way to end the record. I don't really listen to them anymore, which is kind of a shame because they were one of the first prog bands I really liked and after a while they just weren't what I liked listening to anymore, but I'll always remember how awesome De-Loused and Frances the Mute were for me for quite a while.

aVI also love the delivery of that line in Obfuscation, with the Growl + shouting in pitch. The entire last 2 minutes of that song is pure prog heaven.\u000a\u000aMy favorite would probably be in the same song, at it's closing,\u000a\u000a"We will always be part of the great misdirect, stepping in, stepping out.\u000a

aVFuck it, long post.  Buckle up.\u000a\u000a**Anathema - [One Last Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs-emvLUY20)**  \u000a*Oh I wish, I wish you could've stayed.*  \u000aI don't think I know of a heavier song (emotionally) than this.  It's about the death of the mother of some members of the band, but the words, because they are so plain and direct, can apply to anyone feeling a similar loss (I'm still afraid to listen to this since my dog died because it's so powerful).  The last lyric (above), though, is just bare grief, and devastating for it.\u000a\u000a**Dream Theater - [Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqHSrJ2mLo0)**  \u000a*Her ecstasy means so much to me  \u000aEven deceiving my own blood  \u000a...  \u000aHelp! He's my brother, but I love her  \u000aI can't keep away from her touch  \u000aDeception, dishonor*  \u000aEdward generally feels like a straight villain, but these lines allow a little bit of humanization.  For a moment, we see him not as a cold-blooded killer but as a desperately conflicted man.\u000a\u000a**Dream Theater - [Only a Matter of Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXD4gonkJIA)**  \u000a*Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on horizon  \u000ain a steady-set gaze  \u000aa mariner soon from an open cocoon  \u000atakes a moment to summon his courage  \u000ato stifle his grave apprehension and  \u000atrembling, approaches the surf  \u000aA father's benediction as his hopeful son departs  \u000ato brave the sea of rage and conquer at all costs  \u000alingers in his memory  \u000aand visions still surviving in a logic-proof shell  \u000athat should have been held sacred, safe and hidden well  \u000aare compromised in usury  \u000awith every rising sun that yields no sight of land  \u000athe hesitation cultivates within the tired man  \u000aand rumors spread of mutiny  \u000aand though the time will come when dream and day unite  \u000atonight the only consolation causing him to fight  \u000ais fearless faith in destiny*  \u000aFirst of all, in a song about a band sticking it out in the face of potential failure, this seafaring metaphor is unusual but expertly handled.  When the band lost Kevin Moore, they lost more than just a keyboard player.  Outside of the vivid imagery, Moore plays with the sounds of the words to great effect.  Alliteration (*sacred, safe*, *consolation causing*, *fight // is fearless faith*) and tight internal rhymes (*mariner soon from an open cocoon*, *unite // tonight*) help to stabilize the unusual rhythmic structure of the passage.  Counting stresses (mostly by iambs), the lines *A father's...* pattern 7-6-4-7-6-4-6-7-4-6-7-4, a very uneven structure; though Dominici doesn't sing it according to that pattern, it still underlies the syllables that he must sing, and the effect remains still.  In fact, Dominici's delivery of these lines is just as imbalanced, dividing his stresses evenly through some lines and in others being rather lopsided (listen to *and visions \u2026 hidden well*).\u000a\u000a**Gentle Giant - [Think of Me With Kindness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z833vvmbKGM)**  \u000a*And you know, long ago when first we made our promise -  \u000aEmpty words, I wonder did you know -  \u000a\u2026  \u000aFare thee well,  \u000afare thee well,  \u000ayou that was once dear to me.  \u000aThink of me with kindness  \u000aThink of me.*  \u000aIt's rare to see a breakup handled with such grace.  The first of these two segments stands out to me as a sentiment so rarely ever expressed, and done so well here.  But it's the second that makes me love the song so much.  How better and more bittersweet to part from a beloved than simply to be remembered fondly?\u000a\u000a**Porcupine Tree - [Even Less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NrhKM3G8Mg)**  \u000a*But you're a martyr for even less*  \u000aThe stupid pointlessness of suicide.\u000a\u000a**Porcupine Tree - [A Smart Kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfPy8XtbvYA)**  \u000a*There was a war but I must have won  \u000aPlease take me with you.*  \u000aSteven Wilson has a gift for expressing tragedy with disarming simplicity.  A hauntingly unique twist on the alien abduction theme.\ufeff\u000a\u000a**Riverside - [Forgotten Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU9NZUyiEbI)**  \u000a*Oh, how quickly they died  \u000aOh, how quickly they turned into  \u000aThe dust of the forgotten land*  \u000aThe whole set of lyrics for this song is great.  I love the portrayal of the rise and fall of a great, arrogant civilization, ending in only ruins (reminds me of \u201cOzymandias\u201d), punctuated by the chilling *Oh listen to them now*.  But the crucial moment of collapse, which I quoted above, is the clear peak.  No memorial, no tale of great defeat.  They died and turned into dust.  No more.  And Mariusz sings it with a frustrated, lamentatious grit that emphasizes the tragedy.  (Side note: I recommend to anyone to play the game Journey and then listen to this song.)

aVI pay very little attention to lyrics and this is more tech death than prog, but Nile's latest album has some ones I really like:\u000a\u000a["I am alone in making the transformation from man into God"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdqnylEmQYc#t=3m05s)\u000a\u000a[Every mortal is lost ...

p7877
aVI love lyrics that create their own world and atmosphere. My favourite example would be Karnivool, they have this "The world is ending but somehow that isn't all that bad"-feel. I don't know, imagine you are watching the sun explode: You know you are doomed, but in the face of death you become calm, accepting and appreciative of everything. Best example would be Aeons:\u000a\u000a*And I hope you hold a place for us*\u000a\u000a*Far enough away*\u000a\u000a*From all the flames they like to tell us burn*\u000a\u000a*And I hope you hold a way for us*\u000a\u000a*But I don't really know you*\u000a\u000a*I don't really know you...*\u000a\u000aAnother band that conveys a certain feeling for me in their songs is Porcupine Tree, especialkly the songs that are about Wilsons childhood. I don't really know how to say it, but for me they have this feeling of a summer holiday when you are in elementary school, with only a few things being important, almost everything being perfect, but now that you are grown up and look back at it you can see how twisted and wrong some of the things were. Best example would have to be the classic Trains:\u000a\u000a*Train set and match spied under the blind*\u000a\u000a*Shiny and contoured the railway winds*\u000a\u000a*And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed*\u000a\u000a*The hiss of the train at the railway head*\u000a\u000a*Always the summers are slipping away*

p7891
aVWhat is with Browne keeping his pinky on the highest string? It's almost like torque for all that down picking!

aVI do something similar when I'm string skipping quite a bit. It gives me a reference point for how far I have to move my picking hand to the string i want to reach.

p7894
aVUgh can't stand that crackly bass tone... great technique though
p7895
aVI like Monuments, and Browne's playing is really awesome to hear and watch, but listening to a full album I really felt like this is just a generic djent list of songs. No surprises, badass riffs and catchy choruses, everything that happens is pretty much expected. Just my opinion, but this band should take more risks and innove more.
p7896
aVI think there's plenty of cool proggy bits if you listen closely but what impresses me most is that there really isn't a bad song on their latest LP. They aren't going for wankery and I like that.

p7907
aVI remember when they did a Taylor Swift cover people were complaining about the vocals. Like seriously?
p7908

aVOh. See, that's what I was afraid of. Because [Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzby8GO_sBw) doesn't get enough love. 
p7931
aVI'll definitely check them out - the first six minutes so far sound promising.
p7932
aVGod I wish I could've seen them live. Such a sick song by such a sick band.
p7933
aVLove this band. Kinda sucks that I can't wear their shirt in public anymore though.
p7934
aVThis band should change their name to Osama. 
p7935
aVI was browsing video and this was fuckery of a misleading title.  neighbor countries are damming rivers to close down water supply  on Isis, the terrorist group.    This's a song.. ugh
p7936
aVSorry, I'll let the Egyptian goddess know she needs to stop obscuring 21st century political news headlines.

asVTool: Hooker With A Penis. Heavy as fuck and funny as hell.

(lp7939
VAll you read and wear or see and hear on tv is a product begging for your fat ass dirty dollar so shut and buy, buy, buy, my new record. Send more money. Fuck you buddy.
p7940
aVMore of these words need to be capitalized. This song is SUCH a rush. Love listening to this when im feeling disenchanted with the world around me. 
p7941
aVI, too, listen to Ænima when I'm feeling a bit too comfortable with things. Lateralus is for centering, though. I only listen to 10,000 Days when I'm in a good place.
p7942
aVWings for Marie makes me sad though. I always think about my grandma.
p7943
aVTool is perfect for disenchantment. I also listen for motivation. Helps me re-align. This is one song I've never seen live and am awaiting patiently.
p7944
aVThey opened with this song last time I sawb them several years back. It was pretty awesome.
p7945
aVSame here. 
p7946
aVI've got some advice for you, little buddy.

aV"My new record" has always sounded like "Fuck you, Reagan," to me.
p7951
aVYup..
p7952
aVNever listened to Tool... (Don't shoot me yet) but where can I start with them?
p7953
aVLateralus and 10000 Days are catchier albums so they may be the best starting point, specifically the songs Lateralus, Schism, The Grudge, The Pot maybe too.\u000a\u000aÆnima and Undertow are both darker and more evil, but they're both fantastic in their own right. Ænima is probably their best album so if you like what you hear I'd say just listen to that full through to really enjoy them. 
p7954
aVSo like basically anywhere haha :) 
p7955
aVI'd start with the Aenima album myself. It gives you a good idea of what they're about. Stinkfist, Aenima, 46&amp;2 are good entry level tool songs.
p7956
aVTool has significantly changed over the years. Each album seems to get more and more complicated both rhythmically and acoustically. I'd start at the beginning and work your way from there. Opiate, Undertow, Aenima, Lateralus, 10,000 Days. Their first hits were [Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF_WKwbueG8) and [Opiate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt0Zqo-vOFM) and are both a great way to get a sense of what this band is about. Undertow is a brilliant album (may be my favorite) with [Flood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cNR2Td2lIE) being one of the epics. It starts slow but the payoff is well worth it. I'll let you discover the rest. Enjoy.\u000a\u000aNow it's time to go on a tool binge. 
p7957
aVAenima is my favorite, which this is from.
p7958
aVI'm jealous... You've got such a great journey ahead of you. I wish I could rediscover them.
p7959
aV[deleted]
p7960
aVI know this goes against what most are saying, but I would start with Lateralus if you're just getting into Tool. It's a much more accessible album than Aenima and Undertow, which I've not really been able to get into at all after several attempts to over the years. 
p7961
aVOne of my favorite Tool songs. So good.
p7962
aVGod, I love this band. Was just spinning Lateralus today at work for everyone to hear.

p7972
aVThank you! We'll be posting these like every two weeks. I'll be putting them up here, so feel free to check them out! Side note, I almost joined a djent band a few months ago. Glad I didn't, only because the guy who took my place is WAY better at it then I would have been! haha

aVI play bass and if I could be half as good as you I'd be happy. Keep doing what you're doing because it sure as hell works for me!
p7977
aVWow, thanks! You guys are gonna make me blush.
p7978
aVDude, you're crazy good and very fun to watch! Your band has a great sound, everything fits together very well
p7979
aVA little late to this, but, damn man, you're amazing at both the bass AND the vocals.
p7980
aVThe instrumentals were on point. Everything grooved and fit together really well! 
p7981
aVThanks! All credit for the groove to our phenomenal drummer. Never played with a guy who makes prog groove quite like he does! Love playing with him.
p7982
aVThat bass is absolutely stellar! Great job guys!
p7983
aVCool stuff! Your vocalist has an almost Jørn Lande quality to his voice. 
p7984
aVThanks, man! I am the vocalist, and I love comments like this because, and maybe I should be embarrassed to admit this, I have never listened to Jorn Lande. Which means I have some new music to check out. Looking forward to it.

asVClutter - The Enemy (Can't think of many bands from Portugal! FFO: Periphery, Twelve Foot Ninja, Persefone?)
p8001
(lp8002
VAlmost turned it off, but after 30 seconds or so has some pleasant surprises. Nice acoustic interspersion and decent clean melodies, some of the additional synth textures reminded me of a Persefone-ish sound.\u000a\u000aWouldn't say it's as good as any of the bands it reminds me of, but not a bad amalgamation of a few different sounds for a debut! I'm a sucker for a good [WAAAOOOHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTGG4qP_FN0#t=58). Also really like the transition [at 3:00 or so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTGG4qP_FN0#t=169), just tiny bits that stuck out as pretty good to me.
p8003
aVActually, check out Shell From Oceanic if you didn't already. Very talented instrumental prog fusion, great rhythms, some epic melodies... and they are from Portugal too. Digging these guys as well. Good overall effort into making this album, deserves recognition
p8004
aVHey, listening to it right now, I've definitely seen the album cover before (I remember the obvious comparison in art to Language), but didn't check out the music. Glad I went back to it, some cool stuff!

aV**My favorite headache:** This is the exciting opening track with the heavy-does-it bass riffs. If you're a Canadian or Quebecker, the lyrics would get you right away: "*One man standing on the plains of Abraham, Watching a damaged sunrise, One man standing near the edge of a quiet Breakdown*." This album came out in 2000. It was an interesting alternative to the Rush stuff but with still a bit of the flavor of course. [Album details](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favourite_Headache)\u000a\u000aIt's an alternate dimension where Geddy let himself experiment a bit further. Indeed an underrated album, and we would be open for more.
p8018
asVPeriphery - Buttersnips
p8019
(lp8020
VEasily one of their best! I'm sad they're straying so much from their original sound, but I guess you can't be upset with progression from a progressive metal band..
p8021
aVTell that to Opeth fans.
p8022
aVTrue..but even as an Opeth fan myself who doesn't like their new material as much I can't expect them to pop out death metal records for the rest of their lifetime. I appreciate the direction they're going in, but it's not my favourite. Same goes with Periphery
p8023
aVI'm just glad they're playing old heavy material live again, I'm happy for them to evolve in the direction they want if they'll do a little fan service live.
p8024
aVWith you there, I commend them a lot for exploring new ground but at the same time I'm very disappointed at the fact that there will never be an album like P1 again. New bands won't even come close to that.
p8025
aVTo me, the new songs have made me think the equation for the new album is P1+P2=P3. The P1 sound is also Misha, not 'Periphery' as they are now, so it was to be expected. Still lots of classic Misha goodness in the new songs so far though. 22 Faces, Bad Thing, Graveless... They all sound dope imo
p8026
aVI agree. I'm a P2 person, but I still enjoy P1 and the new stuff immensely.
p8027
aVYup. Awesome song. Love the clean tapping section in the middle with the groovy drum beats.
p8028
aVIt's very satisfying to play on guitar too!
p8029
aVHaha yes it is! Really cool tapping riff/lick

asVPeriphery's Juggernaut Dual Release Debuts at #15 and 16 on the Billboard 200, Quite a Milestone.
p8036
(lp8037
V&gt;We\u2019re incredibly proud of the progressive approach we took to releasing this body of music from such a progressive group of artists\u000a\u000ahow progressive...
p8038
aVIts even funnier because it's their least prog album yet
p8039
aVI thought it was pretty damn progressive. Jazzier parts here and there, definitely more musical, more experimental, and theres a concept behind both albums. Just because every song isn't djenty wankery doesn't mean it isn't progressive. Juggernaut is Periphery's strongest and most progressive effort to date.
p8040
aV[deleted]
p8041
aV&gt;Just because every song isn't djenty wankery doesn't mean it isn't progressive. \u000a\u000aReally getting sick of this lame strawman that every periphery fan defaults to when I say their latest album isn't as progressive as P2. The djent honestly has nothing to do with it.
p8042
aVSo I also believe that this is a more progressive approach from Periphery than Periphery 2. My reasons are varied but primarily steeped in the song structures and their approach to the whole album\u000a\u000aI do conced the pop elements you reference in the rest of this thread, but I will politely point out that Periphery 2 was very poppy. I could barely enjoy The Gods Must Be Crazy because of the overly catchy chorus.\u000a\u000aI haven't felt the catchyness of Juggernaut has worked to its detriment. Heavy heart is almost a borderline alternative track, but it might be my favorite track on Alpha, if for no other reason than that it is simply a well constructed song. Its just good, and Spencer's vocals really kick ass in the track! They fucking use an acoustic as a layering track! No djent band has the balls to do something so against the very grain of 'djent'. Those melodies are so impressive! The hooks are not bubblegum but just well constructed. That's why it works.\u000a\u000aIf you want the quintessential prog standout track on this entire double album, look no further than The Scourge, which showcases an off time build of one melody and  and one arrangement until it explodes into an entirely different key and time signature with quite possibly the most head banging riff they've ever wrote. Spencer truly shines on this track, pushing the boundaries of his role as singer. He almost hits Mike Patton levels of crazy vocals, with his raw, visceral scream, off melody singing pattern and then growling sectional lyrics. Then he fucking releases all that build up in a full on layered vocal that morphs into a chant! All from one damn song! If that isn't progressive, then you are missing it. This is the Periphery I envisioned when I first heard Casey's fucked up vocal arrangement on Inertia, the first song they released as the modern Periphery back in 2008.\u000a\u000aYeah, this wasn't TOOL levels of genre breaking music, but it is a fun and explorative djent album. This album is so far my favorite effort of Periphery. I really appreciate the risks they are taking. They are stepping on the toes of what YOU (as a fan) think they should put out, and creating something they earnestly wanted.\u000a I felt that this point definitely came across in this album release.\u000a\u000aI say all this in respect. I up vote you for promoting discussion.\u000a\u000a
p8043
aVA little late to the party on this one, but I really enjoyed reading your analysis. I definitely see eye to eye on you on almost all of this. 
p8044
aV&gt;2 posts about how it's less proggy, still hasn't explained why.
p8045
aVBecause its too formulaic and half the songs are just pure pop metal.\u000a\u000aSpencers vocals are also over done and are far worse than P2
p8046
aVExplain what "Pop metal" is. Cause I haven't heard any Periphery on any radio stations.
p8047
aVSome of the songs are pretty poppy. In the sense they have strong, catchy, choruses. Some parts sounds pretty damn close Coheed who have been on the radio.\u000a\u000aI'm not knocking it. I love the diversity the albums have, both the poppy and metal side.  
p8048
aVAlpha, 22 Faces, The Parade of Ashes, Jetpacks Was Yes 
p8049
aVExplain the genre, not list songs that are 'too poppy for your taste' 
p8050
aVVery solid songs, all of em.
p8051
aVnever said they weren't
p8052
aV[deleted]
p8053
aVi'm listing songs which are perfect examples of pop metal since you asked what it was
p8054
aVBut you've failed to describe WHAT POP METAL IS. 
p8055
aVI very much disagree. Once you listen to them a few times, It grows on you. Then its just amazing from there.
p8056
aVWho gives a shit anymore really? Why are you going to tack on additional genre descriptions?\u000a\u000aThey've got heaps of talent, they wrote (and continue to write) incredible songs and the production is top notch.\u000a\u000aNo matter what someone does, there will always be a lesser wannabe that will criticize them warrantlessly. 
p8057
aVall I'm saying is I don't like the album as much as P2 and I'm disappointed. I don't want periphery to make a contrived P1/P2 clone, I'd rather they make music that they want to. but just because juggernaut is the album that they wanted to make doesn't mean I like it.
p8058
aVThat's been the main gripe I've seen with fans and new Periphery. A lot of fans won't be happy unless the band released Periphery 1 2.0. It's not some lame stawman, it's exactly what a majority of the Periphery fanbase that is upset with Juggernaut is saying. You also just said that its "their least progressive work to date". And looking at Periphery's release history (very very djenty, much wankery)... Congratulations, you've embiggened the strawman.
p8059
aVTake all the djent away from P2 and its still way more prog than Juggernaut. In fact, probably more prog than it was originally, since djent has nothing to do with prog.\u000a\u000aBut since I think P2 is more prog, I must automatically like djent, right?
p8060
aVP2 was a much djentier album than Juggernaut. And I don't agree with you one bit with the whole "take the djent out of P2 and it'll still be more progressive than Juggernaut" claim. Periphery is moving away from the djent sound, but getting proggier and proggier. In fact, they are progressing in their musicality and song writing. By definition, they are getting more progressive.
p8061
aV&gt; In fact, they are progressing in their musicality and song writing.\u000a\u000aProgressing, or regressing?\u000a\u000aP2 actually felt like a prog metal album and was indeed a progression from P1, then Clear came along and gave us 30 minutes of fun pop metal, which I was fine with since it's just a side project. I've listened to Juggernaut enough now to make the verdict that I don't like this album. It's really boring, formulaic. Spencer's vocals are overdone and don't sound anywhere near as good as P2. Sorry
p8062
aVZero and Extraneous were pop metal? Come on bruh.
p8063
aVTo each their own, I guess.
p8064
aVWhat's more proggy than a freaking 80 minute concept record? Nothing. The answer is nothing. 
p8065
aVNothing was prog as shit, idk if it was really a concept album, though...
p8066
aVA concept record of formulaic music that still tells a story
p8067
aVPopgressive. Is that a thing yet?
p8068
aVIt is now!
p8069
aVThey deserve it. I can't get over how excited I am to see them this friday!!!
p8070
aVI wonder how many more times they coulda' used 'progressive' in the post.
p8071
aVWe\u2019re incredibly proud of the progressive approach we took to releasing this progressive piece of music from such a progressive group of artists for such progressive fans.\u000a
p8072
aVAs a person who wasn't really a fan of their previous works for various reasons, I must say, I really love this album.  I've had it on constant repeat since it became available on Spotify.  \u000a\u000aOnce I satiate my current obsession with this album I will most likely re-listen to the rest of their catalog with renewed interest.  
p8073
aVI think the biggest thing they brought is diversity. I would put on P2, listen for 15 minutes then get bored. Every song on Juggernaut  an  identity.\u000a\u000aI especially love they explored a poppy sound while keeping to their roots.  Keeps things varied and interesting.
p8074
aVAnybody knows exact amount of copies sold ?
p8075
aVa progressive amount!
p8076
aVThe amount of unneeded controversy surrounding this album is too damn high...
p8077
aVI enjoyed the first 2 sentences of the article before the ads overtook me. 
p8078
aVIn my day a double album was packaged together.
p8079
aVTheres only like 3 songs from the double that i can listen to.
p8080
aVWhat are they?
p8081
aV22 faces,  rainbow gravity, and stranger things. Everything else has a pop tone or just bad mixing. Doesnt sound anything like p1 or 2, clear sucked. \u000a\u000a
p8082
aVAs much as I don't want to be one of the guys complaining about the over-abundace of Periphery on here, did this really need to be posted here? This feels like it would be fine on /r/peripheryband, but a prog metal album reaching #15 on the charts isn't really that impressive. It's a high charting for Periphery, and a high charting for Djent, but really not for prog metal. Opeth, Mastodon, Dream Theater, Tool have all had much higher charting albums.
p8083
aVfirst of all, every time a popular prog metal band puts out a new album people post about it here frequently for the first couple weeks.  Not sure why you're singling out Periphery when it happens all the time here.\u000a\u000aSecondly, Prog Metal is still a niche genre, so regardless of what other prog bands have done, it is still notable when a prog band charts in the top 20, especially when it's a young band like Periphery that is really just hitting its stride.  This isn't a band that has had decades to build a cult following before starting to chart high.  They are doing it with their 3rd release(s).  And what's more impressive is that they are doing it while releasing not one, but two albums.\u000a\u000aAs for the other bands you listed, in the US Opeth has never charted above 19.  It took DT almost 20 years to put out a top 20 album.  Mastodon's highest is 6.  Is that "much higher?"  As for Tool, yeah they're one of the biggest bands in the world.  Does that invalidate Periphery's success?  In any case I think you're really overstating how common it is for prog metal bands to chart in the top 20 (just talking in the US here)...it's only really the upper echelon of prog bands.  So if nothing else, this news is noteworthy because it firmly puts Periphery in that group.
p8084
aVWhile I'm not really a Periphery fan (I appreciate their jams seriously) I think it's a huge deal and deserves to be shared here.
p8085
aVI dunno man, I think it's a pretty big deal, especially considering both of the albums made it that high. I mean, obviously no one's going to buy only one half of a double album, but still... The bands you mentioned are huge and have been together for 15+ years, as well.  \u000a  \u000aI guess I'll add some sort of disclaimer saying that I hate Periphery's new direction and haven't heard either album yet.
p8086
aV&gt;I **hate** Periphery's **new direction** and **haven't heard either album** yet.\u000a\u000aHow is this even possible?
p8087
aVEasy, you listen to one or two songs, and decide you don't like the new form of the band.
p8088
aVRemember P2 and The Joy of Motion when the singles were released and people were all 'these songs suck, generic metalcore' and 'AAL becoming a standard djent band wtf' and then the albums dropped and suddenly they were AOTY material? \u000a\u000aI don't really care if you like the bands or not but I feel like people should give albums a chance instead of judging them based off a couple of singles. 
p8089
aVThis happens for any song by any band in any genre. I think people just want to hate things.
p8090
aVBecause I've heard PII, Clear, and the singles from these albums and I prefer PI over all of them.
p8091
aVGive both albums a listen before passing judgement on a few out of context songs. \u000a\u000aClear is not even relevant because it was each member writing their own song. 
p8092
aVConsidering this doesn't really happen often for bands of the genre I think it's definitely worth noting in this sub. I'm very happy for them, they are extremely talented and hardworking. \u000a\u000aThis is well deserved. 
p8093
aVAs others have said. When bands release music, their subreddit is usually flooded with new tracks. With the exception of some, most band subreddits are poorly moderated and those interested may never see this link.  \u000a  \u000aI'd also like to point out the hide link between "save" and "give gold". Once you hide something, you won't see it again in the sub.
p8094
aVYeah. I see a post about Periphery on a daily basis here. I remember a few days ago, there was a post about one of their concerts being cancelled, which only really matters if you like the band, live in that specific city, and were planning on going to that concert. For a subreddit devoted to all progressive metal, information about the concert or success of one band really seems irrelevant, especially since I am not all a fan of the band.
p8095

p8158
(lp8159
VI'm 17, wear custom fitted earplugs with the highest filters available, and I still think some of these shows are just too damn loud. It isn't about, "drowning out the crowd" as some people on here have suggested. It's about the sound guy being deaf / not giving a proper fuck about the audience. Their goal is to show off their sound system, to see what it can do. Their goal ought to be making the show more enjoyable. If anyone in the crowd is even conscious of the sound guy being there, something is wrong with the whole situation. \u000aSorry for the rant. 
p8160
aVNO we need this rant.\u000aI agree with you.  No matter what we are right in that its too damn loud.\u000aIf you are at home do you turn it up until you cant tell whats going on in the song?  NO\u000a
p8161
aVI've noticed at a few shows that sometimes the opening acts will be mixed terribly, but then the headliners are a lot finer tuned and crisp. \u000a\u000aMy hypotheses for this is that they either have the sound mixed for the headlining band and can't be bothered to change it up for the openers, bigger bands have their own sound engineer/ actually care what they sound like, or they just fluke out and the staff at the venues literally don't give a shit how the bands sound and just care about your money.
p8162
aVAll of the above.
p8163
aVThis is almost entirely accurate
p8164
aVI think you're spot on.  Last show I went to where there was a huge contrast was Priest/Anthrax.  The mix for Anthrax was so loud, that even with earplugs, the sound level hurt.  Like, the sound waves were just pummeling your body.  It sucked, and after a while, the group I was with went out to the arena lobby to hang out till the set was over.  Priest came out and was perfect.  
p8165
aVI was at a gig last year where the venue had an infamously terrible sound guy. He just drowned out the vocals, the first band's sound suffered hugely as a result. The headliner (YOB) were experienced enough to stop and tell him to turn everything down and the vocals up through each monitor which solved everything. I'm inclined to agree that some sound guys are just assholes and bands need to know how to handle them.
p8166
aVThat's pretty much it. Also, depending on the show, they also come in with their own gear sometimes, I mean, the opening act's playing through some shitty Chinese brand 24 channel desk from 1992 while the headliner's got some crazy modern digital desk with racks of all sorts of audio goodies. When my band was opening for a big band, we got a pretty awesome desk(I'm not sure if we shared it with the headliner), but our sound guy was specifically instructed by the promoter, the headliner's management and the headliner's sound guy that the SPL was not to exceed a certain amount. Anything above that all the way to what was deemed safe was reserved for the headliner. So yes, headliners get priority. After all, that's what you're paying to see. 
p8167
aVIf a metal fan says it's too loud, it's way too loud.\u000a\u000aedit: oopsy
p8168
aVWay.
p8169
aVHaha a truer statement has never been spoken. \u000a\u000aEver since a Mastodon concert a few years back left my ears ringing for days, literally DAYS, I've been sure to bring a pair of earplugs to every show I attended. Aint nobody got time for hearing loss. Not even metal heads who enjoy their music turned up to 11. It's an issue that really should be addressed and fixed. 
p8170
aVThis is one of the best posts I've seen in a while. I couldn't agree more. It always seems to be metal too. \u000a\u000aI like my music loud - especially at a concert - but there is satisfying loud and painfully loud. Metal almost always ends up painfully loud. \u000a\u000aJam bands like Umphreys and Phish always seem to have super well mixed and pleasurably loud sound. 
p8171
aVexactly, it can be done!!!!!!
p8172
aVThere are a LOT of different aspects of a sound system. If an audio guy isn't trained as well as they should be they won't know how to fine tune each stage of the system, and the end result will sound bad. It's not all just the console the guy is standing behind, it's also the system controller, power amplifiers, and speakers themselves. If just one of these devices is set wrong, it can make the whole system sound bad.
p8173
aVSubwoofers with phase issues fml
p8174
aVAs someone who works in the production industry I'd just like to point out that touring bands usually bring their own sound guy, so she/he's not "showing off the system".\u000a\u000aI would hazard a guess that most of the time the issue is that they're not familiar with the venue acoustics and are having difficulties.
p8175
aVWhich ear plugs do you use?
p8176
aVOn top of all the noise, I can NEVER understand a single word out of the vocalist's mouth. The vocals are always muddied and the singer might as well mumble gibberish and it would sound the same.\u000a\u000aOne of the best examples of a band doing it right live, although not prog, is Amon Amarth. They use dynamic compression to their advantage. The singer can whisper if he wants to and his voice is crisp every single time.
p8177
aVAmon Amarth sounds *amazing* live! They sound so clean and their atmosphere is incredible. Who ever is in charge of their mix needs a pat on the back
p8178
aVYeah, vocals usually get the shaft at shows, which is a major bummer. On the flipside, I just saw The Contortionist on Saturday, and it was one of the best live mixes I've ever heard (though the opening bands were still poorly mixed). I could hear Mike's vocals clear as day, which was great because he absolutely killed it.
p8179
aVI think it depends on the venue. I also saw them on Thursday in Toronto and they sounded just ok. The venue was pretty shitty and it's not a common one that's used by bands stopping by in the city. That could have had a huge impact. Regardless, I was so glad to see these guys. Lots of passion between all of them.
p8180
aVI was at that show and yes they did sound much better than the other bands.  Fallujah was a f ing mess with their sound..  I was standing on the balcony behind the PA
p8181
aVNice! I was definitely let down with Fallujah - partly because of the sound, and partly because they only played songs from The Flesh Prevails, except for one. I know it's their latest album, but it got old on me pretty quick. A man can only take so much whammy bar.
p8182
aVWhen did you go to see Fallujah?  I am planning to see them later this month.
p8183
aVLast Saturday, in Newport, KY.
p8184
aVSide note - do you go to a lot of shows in the area? I moved to Cincinnati 6 months ago and I've only been to a couple (one in Lexington). It doesn't seem like many good shows come through here.
p8185
aVWell i think it has to do with Cincinnati being so conservative and really i dont know.\u000aI know the Who show in 1979 really hurt the city for a while.\u000a\u000aWe always need to go to Chicago or Columbus etc.
p8186
aVNot trying to be rude, but don't ever expect to be behind a PA and have a good experience. It's aimed the other way for a reason. All you're going to hear is backline, monitors, and wrap around from the PA. 
p8187
aVI had to be back there because the sound was horrible and it hurt.\u000a\u000aMy statement sounded like i was proud of where i was standing.  I was back there for the whole show almost, until The Contortionist came on and they were much better.\u000aI would love to see them at the Taft\u000a\u000a
p8188
aVSaw Amon Amarth live, can confirm.\u000a\u000aAlso saw Turisas the same show, they did very well too!
p8189
aVNo more earplugs recommendations!!!!!\u000aI get it.\u000aYou are missing the point!!!!
p8190
aVNo you are old man. Get some earplugs you god dn senior citizen and stop crying. 
p8191
aVSo here's the deal: some sound guys understand the equipment they're using. They know how to operated it and that's about it. They may even have been a musician at one point.\u000a\u000aThe difference between an ok sound guy and a good one is their knowledge of the room's acoustics and the affect the music is supposed to achieve when played to the audience. If the sound guy doesn't understand these concepts you will have shitty unbalanced overblown sound every time. \u000a\u000aThe music needs to be louder the bigger the room is so that the furthest listening spot still has adequate volume levels. However this needs to be taken into consideration compared to the area right in front of the speakers or in front of the stage. Not only does the amplitude change but the quality of the sound changes, too. \u000a\u000aThe decent sound guy has been in the space enough and has monkeyed with the equipment to find this balance throughout the room. Great sound guys can estimate this from venue to venue based on experience. \u000a\u000aNow on the listener end, you have to understand standing right up near the stage is going to be ridiculously loud if the venue is big. Even if it's a smaller venue the musical affect the performers are trying to achieve may require a higher volume to make the music resonate (literally) In the listeners' bodies and minds. Think really low bass notes or in heavier music the chugga chugga of palm muted guitar. This sound wave literally moves you. Quite the feeling. Very enjoyable if you have earplugs. \u000a\u000aSo as much as it is a frustration for you there are just a lot of elements in live sound that can go wrong that aren't necessary related to the sound guy. All of this still doesn't take into consideration the instruments and equipment settings of the musicians, which could also cause problems if they are set up in such a way that doesn't work well with the space. There's only so much a sound guy can do without telling the musicians that their stuff just sounds bad so then some form of compensation has to be made, unfortunately this can result in further problems. \u000a\u000aEarplugs are a good idea anyway but they definitely aren't the only fix to the issue and they may not be the best. \u000a\u000aTry different places in the room. Try talking with the sound guy (if your ever get the chance- maybe in small venues) and see if they're hearing the same thing as you. They will probably tell you to duck off (I'm leaving the typo) but some guys haven't been jaded by people telling them the sound is shit and will take the advice if it is presented in a reasonable fashion. \u000a\u000aBut all of this is only my own experience and is more from the performance side as well as the listener/audience side. I know a few sound guys and have had conversations with them about it but it isn't indicative of all scenarios. \u000a\u000aAlso, before you try to correct my usage of affect, please look it up when concerning musical performance; affect is correct. :)
p8192
aVHappened with Wovenwar in Toronto. I know they're not technically prog metal but it was so fucking annoying that it made me not enjoy the show. \u000a\u000aEDIT: I should add that I was standing right by the mixer at the Opera House with my wife. The house sound tech looked like he was cringing as Wovenwar's "sound guy" took over, and I shit you not...the red lining was EVERYWHERE. I was like "what are you doing! You're just red lining everything!". 
p8193
aVYep out of all 4 bands on the Juggernaut tour, their sound was the shittiest.
p8194
aVI'll just put up the disclaimer that I'm not a sound guy but I've worked around them enough to know the basics and logistics of how and why they make decisions. Here's my two cents as someone who works in the production industry:\u000a\u000a- First - and I know like 30 other people have said it, but it can't be overstated - always wear ear protection. Unless you're watching an acoustic jazz trio or a singer songwriter at a coffee shop you have to protect your ears. If you get decent plugs (NOT the yellow/green foam ones) they can also actually affect the levels of the sound so everything comes through clearer. I hear a lot of people gripe about sound at shows that I've thought sounded fine. Difference? Plugs. With that out of the way, lets move on to some of the other issues.\u000a\u000a- Position in the room - Please take into consideration your positioning in the room relative to the sound system. The audio engineer's job is to make sound loud enough to cover the whole room while setting the mix to sound best AT THE POINT OF THE BOARD. The board is usually 30-50 feet from stage indoors and 75-90 feet from stage outdoors. If you're standing in the first row, this might be why you only hear bass. Subs are generally ground stacked in front of or on the sides of the stage while the PA or line array is flown higher to get better room coverage. It's entirely possible that you're missing the high end because it's shooting over your head. This is the fault of the VENUE and not the engineer. Venues don't want to pay another $5-8000 to get proper sound right in front of the stage because the majority of the crowd is covered (and usually those up front are people enamored enough with the band not to care).\u000a\u000a- Touring engineers - As others have mentioned sound systems and acoustics vary from venue to venue, and it can take a lot of experience in one specific room to make it sound good. However, touring bands usually bring a sound engineer with them. This creates all sorts of little issues because they're not familiar with the room and possibly the equipment. Usually tour engineers are seasoned enough to work their way around most problems, but unknown factors do occur. Is there a balcony in the back? Usually that traps quite a bit of sound and they boost to compensate. If the venue has a digital board they're not familiar with it can take them longer to perform somewhat simple tasks. Just keep in mind that they're probably not sitting on their hands back there.\u000a\u000a- Stage volume - A lot of bands want to crank their shit to 11 on stage. This can create some real sonic problems because the engineer has to be able to mix the sound for the back half of the room while the front half gets blasted by both PA and stage amps. By the time the stage audio gets to the back it's gone through 100 rows of bodies and pretty much negated itself so they only hear the PA, but the front half is saying "WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SO LOUD MY EYES ARE LITERALLY MELTING!!!".\u000a\u000aThere are a lot of factors that go into the decisions that sound guys make and the answer can't always be to "turn it down". They have to make sure the whole room gets coverage (it's actually in most contracts). That said, if you're hearing actual audio clipping and distortion, that's probably because the venue's system sucks ass and they did want to pay for someone to come in and beef it up a bit so it could handle the load.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: There's more at work here than the sound guy.
p8195
aVI agree and i dont want to be that guy that just blames the sound guy.\u000aI do know that we need something better with all of the electronics out there and the scientific knowledge.  \u000aThe fact that a place can say "hey play here" and thats all it takes is ridiculous and unfair to the bands that have to make their way by touring.  They just want to be heard and this is the translation they get.  Marble mumbo jumbo!!!\u000aMaybe i am too old but damn i do love loud music that you feel so maybe i can come up with something to make this world better.
p8196
aVWell, I am 24 and have been feeling like you about this for ever. I commonly use earplugs at shows. \u000a\u000aHowever, I really like the power of all the acoustic waves hitting you outside and inside. I like to feel the bass in my stomach, and the kick drum. And I think it would be really underwhelming to go see a show that just plays quietly.\u000a\u000aIt's true that it sometimes is badly mixed, but a well-mixed, loud enough concert is just awesome. Then, it should be warned that the sound can cause ear damage, and earplugs should be distributed for free at the entry, for those who don't have their own.
p8197
aVI saw Veil of Maya earlier this year and the sound was fucking atrocious. All I heard was a wall of noise and kick drum. I have no idea if they were good or not.
p8198
aVI saw them in January and it was also really bad.  Where did you see them?
p8199
aVThe Catalyst in Santa Cruz
p8200
aVAh yep, I was there.  That was a disappointing show all around, not a great crowd and shitty sound.
p8201
aVI do live sound for a living, and I think there are many things in your post that you're not taking into account. First of all, if a band is very loud, it's not necessarily the sound guys fault. Quite often if a band is too loud and the vocals are muddy, it's because the band themselves are too loud without any PA reinforcement. Full drum kits and guitar stacks are very loud instruments, and sometimes they compete with each other to the point that they become an unruly mess. \u000a\u000aI've dealt with bands who were playing with 2 Fender 4x10 combo amps for each player, totaling to 6 amps. If you have any experience with Fender combos, they're staggeringly loud, even with the volume set to moderate levels. The band I was mixing for had all of their amps on 9, which is unheard of for a room I was mixing in (500-600 cap venue). This, in turn, made it so that no matter how loud I turned up the vocal in the PA, the guitars would still drown them out. I asked the band to turn down, and they wouldn't. With the PA hitting limit (as loud as it can possibly go), the vocals just couldn't compete. \u000a\u000aI assume this is a common problem in metal, especially so with the mentality that metal has to be a loud genre. That, in itself, is another point to take into consideration. You keep bringing up symphony concerts and jazz gigs for things that are a respectable volume. If you ask any person on the street which is going to be loudest between a symphony, jazz, or metal concert, we all know that the metal show is going to be common answer. My point here is that if a band is really that bad sounding, either A. talk to the band and let them know that they're too loud. Many bands want a good sounding show just as much as you do. Or, B. if the band has a touring FOH engineer, talk to them. Sometimes they'll just write you off, but you never know. \u000a\u000a\u000aSomething else that can be an issue, especially with the muddy vocals, is improper mic technique. I've seen SO MANY metal vocalists who have horrible mic technique. This can cause muddiness, thinness, or general lack of volume overall. This, along with cymbal and guitar bleed in the vocal mic can ruin an otherwise acceptable vocal performance.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn top of that, some bands are just plain hard to mix. The other night I was filling in at FOH for a friends band at a local venue. They play instrumental, synth-filled prog. There were 3 bands before them, 2 indie and one pop-punk (it was a strange show). The first 3 bands all shared a drum kit. That kit was so easy to mix, and so well tuned that I didn't really have to do much to get a great mixing going with it. Then came the headliner. No matter how much I tried, I could NOT get that drum set to sound good. The toms had no attack, weird resonances, and a general muddiness without a perceivable tone throughout. The snare was super loud (even unmic'd), and the cymbals were crazy harsh and loud. I could only get the kick to a useable sound. The guitar sounded OK, but the guitarist had an axe-fx and didn't have pretty much any of his sounds level-matched, so I had to ride his fader all night. The bassist's tone was fairly thin and honky, and EQing the honk out took away all of the character and intelligibility of the instrument. All of this on top of a very harsh backing track made for the mess you've been describing. So, sometimes it comes down to badly tuned/maintained instruments and mediocre players. No matter how hard the guy at FOH will try, the band will sound like a mess.\u000a\u000a\u000aLastly, you've been saying you don't want to wear earplugs, and while you're obviously free to not wear them or not *want* to wear them, it's becoming extremely commonplace to do so. If you get a nice pair of [These Earplugs](http://www.amazon.com/Etymotic-Research-ETY-Plugs-Protection-Earplugs/dp/B0044DEESS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425329697&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ER-20), I guarantee you that you will be able to hear the band clearly. They take away all of the harsh high end and shitty, muddy boxiness that can cloud a mix. Added to that, PAs are becoming more powerful and efficient pretty much by the year. The days of yore where a PA was strictly for the vocals, and eventually the vocals, kick drum, and keys are essentially gone. You can pump pretty much as many dB into a venue as you see fit for a fraction of the price, space, and weight than ever before. Sure, some people may take this too far and generally mix far too loud, but I assure you that there are plenty of sound people just trying to do the best with what they're given, be it bad players, bad instruments, loud bands, and bad singers. \u000a\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Don't just blame it on the sound guy, man. Some of of genuinely care and want the show to be as awesome as possible.
p8202
aVWhats funny is that some orchestras can be as loud as metal shows.  The CSO's Brass is the strongest in the world and it can actually get to like 115+ dB.
p8203
aVOk fair enough.  Im not blaming the sound guy completely.\u000aI am saying that something needs to be done.\u000aFurthermore if it sounds shitty, turning it up to bleeding levels is not the answer.  I know you know this and I'm sure plenty of sound men would agree in saying that their profession is full of idiots.\u000aYes i have been comparing the jazz and orchestral shows but in all honesty how many of us would rather hear the show instead of cower away!!!\u000aIt isn't simple i know.\u000aBut when in doubt don't turn it up.\u000a\u000aIm hoping that some musicians will see this and try not to be so loud on their own.  Quit competing for sound on the stage and listen to your sound man (if you have hired a good one)\u000a\u000aJust because Scale the Summit has their own sound man doesn't mean he is smart.  He may know what he is doing but when the room won't allow you to turn it up that loud then you shouldn't because you only hurt the band!!!
p8204
aVRandom note: Fates Warning was easily the best sounding crispest live band I've seen. 
p8205
aVSteven Wilson for me.  Followed by Pain of Salvation.  The SW show was probably the only show I've been to where I didn't have some sort of ringing in my ears afterwards, and all the instruments were completely distinguishable from each other.  And it's not like it was quiet, cause the droning instrumental section of Radioactive Toy was monstrous.

aVYes i saw Porcupine Tree at Bogarts in Cincinnati and surprisingly it sounded amazing!!!!\u000aThank you
p8208
aVAgree completely. The Contortionist is one of my favorite bands and both times I've seen them (at different venues) the sound has been so blown out that I had trouble hearing the parts even though I know them by heart. I'm really butthurt about it in regards to that band especially, since they are one of my favorites and they focus so much on dynamics and ambience. But almost every metal show I go to is like this. Fuck hearing any metal band for the first time live, I can't tell what the fuck is going on in the song if I don't know it before the show. I'm not sure if the sound guys think they're entitled to crank everything because it's a metal show or what, but this bugs the piss out of me too. 
p8209
aVThat's rough. When I saw The Contortionist, I was super impressed because it was so unlike the other shows I'd been to. I could actually make out everything that was going on. Maybe it was the venue.
p8210
aVIt's the soundguy.\u000aSaw them twice at the same venue.\u000aFirst time was brilliant and  the mixing was really precise.\u000aSecond time, was very recently and it was like the sound guy cranked an overhead mic so loud all you could here was a cymbal blasting in your ear.\u000aI even saw them at a shit hole in the wall venue and it wasn't the best sound but it wasn't absolute garbage. \u000a
p8211
aVYeah, the venue I was at, the sound was actually really good... must have been just a shitty venue/night for the show you were at.
p8212
aVJust get some earplugs, they do wonders in regards to being able to discern instruments.
p8213
aVIts more than just getting earplugs.\u000aThey need to do their part as well.\u000aIf it was a jazz show do they turn it all the way up?\u000aNo
p8214
aVAlthough I agree with all of your statements up to here on the thread, I think we can agree there is a clear difference between a jazz gig and metal gig.
p8215
aVYeah that lost me as well
p8216
aVsimply stating that metal doesn't have to be so loud to enjoy.\u000aIf you can enjoy a jazz then you can enjoy a metal show the same way.\u000aWe need to get away from the mentality of who started all of the metal and punk movement.\u000aMostly idiots wanting to get back at their parents and society.\u000a\u000aI JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE DAMN MUSIC......THATS ALL
p8217
aVYou should have said what you meant as opposed to talking about jazz and all that.  Most jazz groups/venues don't use FoH sound.\u000a\u000aYeah, they should turn it down.
p8218
aVI hear ya\u000a\u000a
p8219
aVWHAT???  I CANT HEAR YOU ITS TOO LOUD IN HERE MAN!! /s
p8220
aVNot using earplugs is dumb though.  Even a show at a medium/lower volume can damage your ears plenty.  \u000a\u000aYeah, it shouldn't be that earplugs give better sound, cuz obviously venues need to have better sound, but really, you need earplugs.  You'll be deaf by 60.  I'm serious.
p8221
aVCheap ear plugs will fix that right up for you. I don't really mind the discomfort of loud shows, but the unbalanced sound does. [These ones are what I use, and I'd recommend them.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0015WJQ7A/ref=s9_top_hm_bFrJf_g121_i7)

p8223
aVWhen I saw Opeth and Steven Wilson at upstate concert hall in Albany NY it was mixed so extremely loud that Steven said "this is the loudest fucking gig I have ever played" this was in a small venue of about 500 people I would guess.... very unnecessary and just plain painful to my ears.
p8224
aVAnd ill bet that they all screamed and yelled thinking it was a cool statement!!
p8225
aVHaha /u/sebul and I were there! What a show, felt so lucky since it was a one-time thing for that tour where their paths crossed and they decided to play together. And that was my first time seeing either of them to boot heh. Katatonia was also pretty good too!\u000a\u000aBut yeah, pretty crappy venue... :p
p8226
aVDon't forget the hearing damage we now have after seeing Devin Townsend there...
p8227
aVHe was so damn loud
p8228
aVI was actually side/ back stage, it was a really awesome experience. Said hello to a few of the guys (Guthrie, Steven) after the show, awesome time for sure!  Opeth played and sounded incredible that night, along with Steven and his band.
p8229
aVI'm *pretty* sure I've heard Chris say that Scale the Summit has their own sound guy that tours with them, so I'm surprised you had a problem at one of their shows. Maybe their guy wasn't there for some reason or something. I've always found their shows to be at a reasonable volume. But I agree for the most part. \u000aI saw Scale the Summit with Fair to Midland (and others) and everyone's volume was fine until Fair to Midland came out. Either they didn't do a sound check or their sound engineer is Helen Keller. That shit was so fucking loud we just left because we couldn't tell where the music began amongst the barrage of noise we were being face-fucked by. 
p8230
aVI actually asked the sound guy to turn it down at Scale the Summit actually i had to yell at the top of my lungs in order for him to hear.\u000aSeems to me that either this guy was deaf or just didnt care.\u000aThe place was an old church and it was painful.  I stuck paper towels in my ears.\u000aThere was a point that toward the end the crowd was getting into it and head banging a little when the sound guy thought it would be a good idea and turn it up even louder and everyone stopped moving and couldn't get into it!    I saw it.\u000a\u000aI actually told the band about it after the show.  I felt bad but damn they need to know that while they have their own monitors were they want they don't exactly hear what we hear.  \u000a\u000a
p8231
aVI will wear earplugs from now on, however i know most of the sound guys have issues to deal with but they dont even check to see if the audience will drown out the sound.  Trust me in saying that the mentality with metal bands is too be outrageous with the loudness.   The bands that i'm talking about aren't mindless idiots that want it too be this loud.  I would think they would rather be heard individually instead of just a cacophony of metal.\u000aIf you have the volume down then people will be quieter.....besides the people that just like to talk about the band instead of listening to them, which is another gripe i have.\u000a
p8232
aV&gt;besides the people that just like to talk about the band instead of listening to them\u000a\u000aSo annoying. Every show there's two guys yelling in each other's ear about some inane fact they know about the band. What are they paying money for?
p8233
aVI actually yelled at some people at the Porcupine Tree show in 2009 for talking incessantly esp during quiet parts.
p8234
aVI remember when I caught Explosions in the Sky in 2010 (I think) there was a girl and a her friends directly in front of us. One of them just completely talked through the entire first set. Befor Explosions came on I asked her if she'd mind shutting up because this is the band I'm really paying for. She got all angry and walked away, expecting her friends to come with her. They knew she was being stupid and chose to stay right where they were. I found it both pleasing and hilarious.
p8235
aVI was with you until this.  People are loud at a rock concert.  I've been annoyed by it myself.  But, you can have the "home" experience at home or the concert experience.  Unless you are paying for a private show, you sorta get stuck with all the other people who paid to make that show happen, to.\u000a\u000aEdit: spelings
p8236
aVSo you like it when people talk.\u000aIm not asking for anything but to listen to the band i paid to see.\u000aWhen you go to a restaurant you other people get to touch and eat your food that you paid for.\u000aThey are talking when they should be listening to the band!!!!!!
p8237
aVNo, I don't like it when people talk.  But, I have common sense.  I'm at a rock concert.  People are gonna talk.  I've never asked anyone at a rock concert to be quiet so I could listen.  Common sense, dude.  You want a private concert, pay for one.  You go in public to see a metal show, people are going to make noise.  You go out in the rain, you're gonna get wet.  
p8238
aVok then.\u000aWhat are they doing there then?\u000aThey are talking the whole time!\u000aIm not an idiot i am aware people will talk dude.\u000aThey were incessant about it and it was like their own party with PT playing in the background.\u000aSo obviously we arent talking about normal conversation every once in a while. \u000aGive me some credit here man.\u000aIm not a curmudgeon 
p8239
aVWhy would we even need earplugs?\u000aI get it that they might work and like i said i will try it.\u000aBut what im trying to do now is make it so we dont need them.\u000a\u000aThats like making your steering wheel out of knives and the solution would be to wear a vest to protect yourself!!!
p8240
aVWearing ear plugs is a trade off for having music that causes a physical reaction. Want your chest to shake every time they hit the kick drum? Probably should wear plugs. On top of that they help to even out the frequency response from both speakers and subs so less of the sound gets muddled. Frequencies have a tendency to override each other creating a "muddy" sound where you can't distinguish one instrument over another. Plugs help to reduce this muddiness to give you more clarity (good plugs at least).\u000a\u000aAlso, wouldn't you want, like, gauntlets for a steering wheel like that?
p8241
aVThis. Also with tube amplifiers for guitar and bass it's basically required for them to be loud before those vacuum tubes have enough juice behind them so they don't sound cold/sterile. It's annoying but it's the truth for high wattage amplifiers (which have some physical differences in their transformers/types of vacuum tubes they use that have a very real effect on their sound). 
p8242
aVIn some cases the gain knob also acts as a volume for tube amplifiers, so they have to be set at a certain level before they provide the desired distortion.
p8243
aVHi, the thing is, it is common at concerts to play it that loud. Actually you could achieve a studio sound quite easily, but thats not what the average listener wants to hear. Most people want to hear a raw loud and harsh sound live.\u000aI'm studying Recording and got some live lectures too.
p8244
aVI feel like prog metal concert goers are probably not average listeners
p8245
aVDefinitely not when it comes to weight and personal hygiene in my experience. Anything but average there. 
p8246
aV"Harsh and raw" might work for an indie band or your typical rock/metal band.\u000aBecause their gear might be a bit warm, muddy, and not cutting through.\u000a\u000aMost prog/metal bands have a crunchy harsh compressed tone that cuts through already.\u000aFrom the kick drum up to the vocalist.  \u000a\u000aAn example is the bands who use axefx.  Usually the guitar sounds thin, tinny, or just way to loud in a live setting.  Which is what most bands who go for a prog/djent/metal sound use nowadays.\u000a\u000aNot shitting on the gear in anyway, but I certainly wouldn't mix those bands with the thought that this needs to be more "harsh and raw".\u000a\u000a\u000a
p8247
aVPro tip: Go get some custom molded ear plugs. I'm 31 now but spent years touring in super loud clubs.  Spend 70 bucks on some nice plugs and the volume will be perfect and you'll be able to hear everything in the mix at every show 
p8248
aVI dont mind spending money for quality.\u000aI will check it out.
p8249
aVI think it will help a lot. The good ones don't have any frequency loss so the music will still sound good but your ears won't be a ringing mess afterwards. Let us know how it works out!
p8250
aVI absolutely despise this. I've see Between The Buried And Me twice, the first time everything was fantastic, minus Tommy sounding a bit low in the mix. Second time, couldn't hear anything but kick, snare, and the occasional pinch or two.
p8251
aVDo you wear earplugs? You should wear earplugs. The band is wearing earplugs. The sound guy is wearing earplugs. You should wear earplugs.
p8252
aVThey are not wearing them to hear their instruments, they are wearing them because they are dealing with loud music almost everyday. \u000aBeing a normal concert goer, i don't want to or like wearing them.\u000aIf i have to i will from now on but just know i don't have to wear them to see the symphony or a jazz band.\u000a\u000a
p8253
aVThe places you see jazz and symphony bands were also probably constructed with that purpose in mind. That is not an apt comparison to a metal venue, where you may be seeing a band in a re-purposed warehouse.  \u000a  \u000aI understand not wanting to wear earplugs, but the fact of the matter is that wearing them will solve your problem 90% of the time. The guitars will suddenly be less piercing, the bass will be more apparent, the vocals will have some separation from the cymbals / high guitar frequencies, your hearing won't be damaged, etc.
p8254
aVI agree with the venues being the culprit.\u000aI will get some earplugs for sure
p8255
aVSymphony Orchestras can get pretty loud, surprisingly. 
p8256
aVIf it's too loud, protect your ears.
p8257
aVSome of that is disruptive interference, walk around the venue until you find a good sound pocket. Also, ear plugs.
p8258
aVoh ive tried that and nothing helps.\u000a
p8259
aVMaybe you are just cursed with shity venues :) these are the ear plugs I use for concerts. They don't muffle the treble, just cut down overall sound level.\u000aThey are a bit pricey, but I have had mine for like 10 years.\u000a\u000a http://www.hearos.com/hearnowearplugs/
p8260
aVIt goes to 11!
p8261
aVas a former sound guy, I used to struggle with this as well, especially in smaller venues. When you're a house guy and the guitarists have their amps turned up to 11, there isn't much you can do. You can ask the guys to turn it down so that you can have a better chance to mix and balance, but that could be a longshot given on the personalities at play.\u000a\u000aWhat you have to take into account as well is that headliners always sound check first, and usually, for as long as they want. So this means that openers have to deal with a board/system that's already mixed and can't really fuck that up. This is where you'll usually find that openers sound like shit compared to headliners; it's just a result of show politics.
p8262
aVMany of these problems would go away with a good venue.\u000aThe Taft Theater in Cincinnati is one of the best places to see a show, sounds fantastic and looks even better.\u000aIve seen Yes there and you could feel and hear everything and it was loud.\u000aDream Theater turned it up so damn loud that i couldn't take it, they had a speaker popping and JP was wondering what the hell that was!\u000aThe last couple of places have been nasty building and frankly dont care about the sound\u000a
p8263
aVI was going to suggest this. I'm lucky enough that the 4 venues I frequent most I don't have to worry about hearing what's being played.
p8264
aVIt's not always the sound guy's fault. Plenty of bands playing in small venues will have guitarists who insist on turning it up to eleven and bleeding out your ears all on their own. All a sound guy can do at that point is try to compensate. Really though, standard volume for rock and metal shows in the US is too loud to safely endure without ear plugs or filters.
p8265
aVI would say the problem lies more in balancing the mix.  Metal in general has a crazy low end that is very difficult to control.  
p8266
aVWhile I do agree that sometimes its hard to pick out the instruments, you have to look at it from the sound guy and band's perspective. If it's too quiet the crowd drowns out the band and that would be awful. The sound guy also has a responsibility to make the band sound the way that they want to. It is difficult for some sound guys to get a good, consistent sound every night because some of them are using a different mixing board every night. Also, every venue is different, so they're dealing with an entirely new acoustic environment.
p8267
aVOne band I saw, and enjoyed live, was Meshuggah at The Marque Theater in Tempe AZ. They were not attacking my ears and brain with a terrible wall of cacophony. I have tinnitus bad, and I'm starting to wear plugs at band practice now, and when I go to concerts, or gigs. Maybe it was the sound guy was on point, or Meshuggah's own crew?\u000a\u000aAt smaller venues like The Mesa Underground, beneath the Nile Theater in Mesa AZ, the sound is always terrible. Saw Glass Cloud, and they were great, however. But I could not stand Scale the Summit. They were WAY too loud, especially for an instrumental band. Their cleans pierced my ears!\u000a\u000aFor Periphery's Juggernaut tour, they plaid in a new venue for Club Red. Big and spacious, maybe the sound guys weren't used to the acoustics yet, but that entire show was fucking loud as shit. Especially standing stage right by the huge ass stacks. Woven War was god awful. Their vocals were way too loud, couldn't hear any instruments, and they left my left ear numb and buzzing. The drummer was the only entertaining part. Periphery rocked, but, as any headliner in the same vein, it's hard to hear with the crowd so loud. Not to mention the damage done by the open acts on my ears. I've seen Periphery before, and they are always mixed beautifully by Alex Markides. In small venues like Joes Grotto, and even spacious ones like The Venue of Scottsdale.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Some, or most headliners have a crew who know what they are doing. Sometimes it's the crappy venue. But I agree, let's fix this shit, as a musician, having tinnitus sucks, and could become a problem. Thanks inconsiderate sound engineers!
p8268
aVWent too far in the other direction when I saw Between the Buried and Me a couple of years ago in London.  Everything was too quiet! People were shouting for them to turn it up but nope. Annoying as the support acts The Safety Fire and Periphery were perfectly fine. \u000a\u000aA shame too as BTBAM are my favourite band and that's the only time I've gotten to see them. 
p8269
aVYeah, a local venue here in salt lake city has ruined countless shows for me.\u000aThe last show I went to there was the Contortionist.  It was like the engineer cut all the mids out, cranked the highs up crazy loud, then left for coffee.\u000aEven with earplugs it was just terrible mixing.\u000aI had to feel like an asshole with my hands over my ears to even attempt to have a clear picture of what they were playing.\u000aWhich is hugely disappointing, cause they are so amazing live, especially with their newer line up.\u000aThis is a smaller venue and these bands don't bring in people in droves, but that isn't an excuse to not have a decent engineer.\u000a\u000aIt's like going to a movie theater and the projectionist doesn't have the picture aligned on the screen, the house lights are turned on and the staff are talking loudly at the exit doors.\u000a
p8270
aVI have a friend who is a sound engineer who refuses to go to any show with me at the venue here (Ace of Spades, Sacramento, CA) because the sound guy fucking sucks. I've only been to a small handful of shows there where the sound actually had a decent balance. And I've seen way more than just metal bands there, I saw a local indie band there a couple weeks ago and couldn't hear a word out of the vocalist's mouth because the kick drum and snare were so damn high. It's a pretty known thing with music enthusiasts here that the sound guy blows but they have done nothing about it. Unfortunately they are still the main venue here that most bands go to so we have really no choice, especially if this is the only NorCal stop bands make. 
p8271
aVI COMPLETELY AGREE! Over the past few years I've seen tons of shows where whoever the fuck was on the mixing board needs to get their shit together.\u000a\u000aBlack Label Society, High on Fire, and the last Judas Priest show I went to were all just gigantic walls of noise.
p8272
aVAs the guitarist in a band, we make sure our sound guy knows exactly what's up. Also, as a developing band, having an awful sound would harm interest in us, sales, gig opportunities etc... It's an absolute no brainer.
p8273
aVthis is exactly the point!!!\u000a
p8274
aVThe last time I saw Porcupine Tree, I had to leave the venue because the bass was so loud it felt like I was being kicked in the chest every single time the drummer hit his kick drum.  It was physically painful to be in the venue.\u000a\u000aGranted, it was the Electric Factory in Philly, and that place typically has *horrendous* sound.  I don't go to many prog *metal* concerts (as opposed to prog rock) for this reason, because I just can't stand how loud it is.\u000a\u000aI sound like an old fogey...
p8275
aVMetal shows, particularly for less well known acts, tend to really get shafted when it comes to the quality of sound guys they get. I've been to a lot of great metal shows with excellent engineers at the helm. I've also been to a few where the only thing you could hear was a rolling wall of bassy noise and indecipherable clashing mid to high end. Yuck.\u000a\u000aProblem is the venues I think. Metal shows aren't expected to draw very heavy crowds. That's not always the case, obviously, but that's the reasoning at work when the owners of the venue decide that instead of paying a quality engineer for that particular show they'll give that untested kid who's been begging for a job a shot that day instead. Because he's practically going to work for free.\u000a\u000aIt also has to do with metal being the odd man out when it comes to *how* it should be engineered. A lot of guys who do perfectly fine when it comes to engineering a live country, rock, pop, rap, etc. mix have no idea what to do with a sonically dense super compressed metal mix. In their minds, based on the one or two albums they listened to before the show, metalheads obviously like it loud and distorted so "lets just crank it up."
p8276
aVI am sick of not being able to afford going to see bands play lol.
p8277
aV[deleted]
p8278
aVOur main venue here has cement floors and brick walls with no sound absorption materials of any kind.  They crank it up so loud you can't make sense of any instrument.  Even an Opeth concert during acoustic interludes are washed out by sound waves just being bounced around everywhere.
p8279
aVA lot of the time it has to do with additive mixing practices (can't hear it?  Turn up what you can't hear vs turn down masking elements) but some of it is out of the hands of the engineer.  Amps, etc, on stage are usually turned up to a ridiculous level and you are competing with them, and if the band uses wedge monitors instead of in-ears you're going to compete with those suckers blasting at 100dB+ for the band as well.
p8280
aVI still think its great that some bands don't make it big, because you easily see them live without fear of it selling out in an hour, they wont be crazy expensive and its not going to be filled with morons just going to see what band everyone is talking about.\u000aHowever with these shitty venues they have to play at and the lack of sound quality that the owners wont care about since it will cost more money im starting to think that we are in a catch 22.  \u000aI wouldnt mind to pay more if i knew the sound would be good.\u000aThe Contortionist, Fallujah, Revocation and Toothgrinder all for 16 dollars is a freakin' steal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I would've paid triple!!!\u000aSo for that i am grateful.\u000aEspecially since the singer for Toothgrinder fell down trying to climb up the balcony....pretty entertaining.\u000a\u000aListen, if we dont speak up, then this will keep happening, sound guys wont do their jobs right, bands will keep being selfish with their instruments and how loud they want them and shitty venues will keep making money.  \u000aThis "metal" mentality that many people have is foolish!!!  There are plenty of metal fans that are intelligent and want great sound and would rather get what they paid for.\u000aI keep hearing "If its too loud your too old"  I'm sick of it!!!!\u000a\u000a\u000a
p8281
aVThe older you get, the less loud noise you can stand.  Wear plugs
p8282
aVActually...the opposite is true
p8283
aVFunny thing is I heard the exact opposite.  Keep down voting though, since you know, you don't agree with me and that's the intended spirit of the down vote.
p8284
aVI didn't actually down vote you, but you are correct that is the sentiment of the downvote. Hearing sensitivity declines with age. 
p8285
aVI meant that the likelihood of your hearing being damaged by loud goes up as you age.  Yes your sensitivity goes down, but that doesn't mean your ears develop some defense to loud. 
p8286
aVThey do develop a defense against loud.  It's called hearing loss.  It's not good, but it is a defense.
p8287
aVI guess one of the problems with turning it down is that the crowd becomes more audible.\u000a\u000aI'd rather have it a little distorted than drowned out by bad sing/scream-alongs

aVThis album was peerless when it came out in 1996(ish) it took a good 11-15 years for it to start sounding just a touch dated. 
p8315
aVIs it still not peerless?
p8316
aVit sort of is. the only album i know of that came close to capturing that level of dissonant intensity was [The Book of Lambs by Internicine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm2l_jcQum4)\u000athis one is an oldie but a fucking goodie. i believe it was hate eternal's bassist's solo project.

asVThe Contortionist - "Geocentric Confusion"
p8318
(lp8319
VThe last 3 mins or so in this song are just magical....one of my favorite moments from TC
p8320
aVEven better live.
p8321
aVI cried.\u000a\u000aActually, everyone cried. It was beautiful.
p8322
aVThis and Casualty. Best songs on Intrinsic IMO. Hell, the whole fucking album is a masterpiece. 
p8323
aVIntrinsic Contortionist is best Contortionist imo
p8324
aVI think I like Intrinsic just a little bit more than Language, but I like the line-up on Language far more. I feel like the whole band, as a collective, just have this awesome chemistry with each other now. They're phenomenal live. 
p8325
aVProbably around once a day I find myself skipping to the 3-minute mark and listening to one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard.
p8326
aV"Please do not miscalculate my tone"
p8327
aVThe tapping section is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard 
p8328
aVAmazing when performed live, they totally immerse themselves in the music.  Particularly at the end of this track.
p8329
aVCameron always looks like he's having a blast playing live hahaha! They were in Norway in November but I didn't get to see them which bummed me out quite a bit...
p8330
aVI saw them in Denver...front and center right in front of Mike. Easily the best show I've ever seen!
p8331
aVThey only did about a half hour set when I saw them sadly, would love to seem them blast out a good 1.5hr set doing the best of all three albums.....then when I think of it I'm like well I guess they'd have to play all 3 albums in their entirety.  Its seriously hard to think of a track that wouldn't be worthy of a live rendition.
p8332
aVThey NEED to play Feedback Loop. That's one of my favorite songs and they have never played it live to the best of my knowledge.
p8333
aVDude I would kill to see Feedback Loop and Exoplanet! I saw them in October and it was amazing but they played mostly Language stuff.
p8334
aVI've seen them play feedback loop live. Can confirm, it was awesome. \u000a\u000aBest song i've seen them play live though is Oscillator. That long ambient section near the end... Just magical.
p8335
aVI went to see them in Joliet, Illinois last year and they played Oscillator. Everyone was moshing in slow motion during the ambient part at the end. It was incredible 
p8336
aVThat sounds amazing. When/where was this? I've loved them for years but I only got to see them in October at a small place in Syracuse.
p8337
aVI think it was back in 2012. It was before they changed vocalists, and right around when Intrinsic came out.\u000a\u000aI haven't had a chance to see them play anything from Language live yet though
p8338
aVWhen they played Language 1 into Language 2 it was amazing. I'm not a big fan of Primorial Sound, tho. I thought that was boring. They finished with Flourish and that was really good, even with Mike instead of the old vocalist
p8339
aVWhen my friend saw them, they ended up having way more time than expected and said, "So it looks like we actually have enough time for one more song... except... it's three songs."\u000a\u000aAnd everyone cried tears of joy.
p8340
aVIt was Causality that peaked the show.  There's something about live progressive that really hits you on an emotional level, I was in complete awe.
p8341
aVThis is fantastic. Thanks for the share. 
p8342
aVYou need to go listen to this entire album right now. I've been following these guys since Shapeshifter in 2008, and I personally think it's the best thing they've put out.
p8343
aVAlready on it. Thanks though :) 
p8344
aVSaw these guys open up for Protest the Hero.... Literally the weirdest thing I've ever seen. Dude yells for a little then goes to the back near the drumset (still visible) and faces away from the crowd on his haunches. Stays that way up to 5 minutes. Freaking weird. \u000a
p8345
aVYeah the vocalist does look like he isn't experiencing the same world as the rest of us, but I think he just really feels the music on such an intense level and he isn't afraid to express that in his own way and I think that is also reflected in his skill as a vocalist - one of the reasons Language at least for me was one of the best albums I've heard. The passion and feel is there
p8346
aVMike Lessard easily has the most unique stage presence I've ever seen from a singer, and it completely fits. Just like u/icecubenscc I was kinda weirded out the first time I saw them play (also opening for Protest) but the second time I saw them I knew what to expect and his stage presence was captivating. That combined with his incredible vocal skill make him even more fun to watch and listen to
p8347
aVI have a lesson with Cam tomorrow. Do you guys want me to ask him about specific songs or anything? I'm definitely going to learn Anatomy Anomalies, Cortical, and Feedback Loop.
p8348
aVI want to know what their *exact* tuning is. They say standard in interviews, but they're definitely tuned to like G#. I just need to *know*.\u000a\u000aAlso if you could post tabs or a video of how to play [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJyIhPMSS5Y) from Feedback Loop I would love you a lot.
p8349
aVLuckily I have a very good idea of what their exact tunings are.

The video just starts from the beginning of the song. I really want to learn from [this part](http://youtu.be/rJyIhPMSS5Y?t=1m43s) part of the song onwards, especially the lead guitar part. Also, [here is my rough tab of Anatomy Anomalies](http://i.imgur.com/drDrvMJ.png)\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: [Here is a clip of me playing one of the leads from Anatomy Anomalies](https://vid.me/ro8W) (its so short because it was an Instagram clip)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a

p8358
aVThis is exactly what I was looking for ! I really like the off beat feel of a lot of these. Thanks for introducing me to all of this !
p8359
aVI've watched Chris Potter Underground [Open Minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VxMX2LuEW0) probably a half dozen times in the last couple weeks, it's such a great look into his process, and the process of the whole group. Your list is awesome, I need to check out a few of these I don't know!
p8360
aVOh dude, don't even get me started! Listening to everyone speak about what their vision of the group is and watching them take on new tunes for the first time is so insightful. I've been obsessed with Ultrahang for the past three or four years so when I saw the trailer for this way back in 2011, I freaked out. It made it's way online briefly in 2012 and then was taken down, finally being made available in 2013. I just wish I could purchase it on DVD.
p8361
aVI love his album! I really live Scale the Summit though. I hope they're planning on releasing new material soon.
p8362
aVThey are, hopefully the new album will drop this year!
p8363
aVI hope Chris plans on touring the Lightbox! 
p8364
aVHave you listened to The Reign of Kindo yet? The pianist used to be in the band. I definitely suggest checking them out!
p8365
aVYeah I've been a fan for a long time ! I didn't know there was any connection to StS though. Thanks for the suggestion!
p8366
aVSometimes he gets a little flack for some of his writing, but I adore most of Pat Metheny's output, he writes such fantastic chord progressions, always goes places you wouldn't expect, but sound really smooth. He's got sort of a progjazz/fusion group that plays wonderful wonderful music.  \u000a\u000aHell, you want to talk prog, probably my favorite thing the Pat Metheny Group has done is this 5 part singular composition called The Way Up, and all told it's about an hour piece. Recurring motives, cool grooves and meters, and a ton of different textures. The way it's written, it's hard to tell where the structured material ends and the improvisation begins. You can watch/listen to it [live in South Korea!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4JJbY4Qv6c)

p8374
aVThis is the 16 seconds of 2015
p8375
aVI know how much /r/progmetal loves to beat off their collective dicks to anything BTBAM even breathes on, but are we seriously counting 16 seconds of drumming as a worthwhile submission?
p8376
aVdidn't know there was a time requirement
p8377
aVYou could say the same thing with the Corelia updates. But is it only worth complaining about when its a popular band like BTBAM?

aVAre you familiar with the rest of their stuff? If so, what should I get next? This is the only album I have and I practically haven't listened to anything else since I got it. 
p8383
aVTheir self-titled album is probably their next best. If you find you liked what you heard there and maybe want something a little more fuzzy and raw, check out Insider. Echo Street is a softer album as a whole and has a lot of songs like this one, but the pacing's a bit uneven. Mystoria I haven't listened to a ton, but it seems to be a more mainstream effort from them, in some ways similar to Insider-era stuff.
p8384
aVMystoria is a strange album. It opens with a DT/Liquid Tension Experiment sounding instrumental then within a few tracks goes full Rolling Stones. Still cool though.

aVI know people would rather hear new music from EF (and I'm in that boat as well), but I do wish that they'd kept on re-releasing the version2 tracks that were mixed differently. Would love to hear a little more oomph in the low end on this song. Love the album, my ears just get a little fatigued after listening to a chunk of it.
p8402
aVSomething closer to what we were hoping for from the new Periphery :/
p8403
aVFunny, I always thought Periphery should also go in this direction, but maybe a bit less intense as Ever Forthright
p8404
aVYou can totally hear this type of stuff in the old misha and haunted shores tracks. I think in trying to make the songs more digestible, they lost the wow factor that made periphery so standout in the first place.

asVWhere to start with the Dillinger Escape Plan?
p8441
(lp8442
VI'd recommend miss machine to start out with. There are a few poppier songs that I don't personally enjoy but the rest of the  album captures dillinger at some of their most intense, technical, and experimental moments. Ire works is similar, but with more experimental tracks. Calculating infinity has a different singer and is pure face melting madness. One of us is the killer has the two tracks you mentioned and is amazing as well. I'm a newer fan and have yet to listen to option paralysis, but have heard great things about it. 
p8443
aVYou should definitely check it out. Farewell, Mona Lisa and Widower are my favorite off of it. It has a good combination of the sound from ire works and one of us is the killer (since its between those two) and the first album billy rymer recorded with them. Gil Sharon is fantastic on ire works but I like billy better for some reason
p8444
aVI just took your advice and it was amazing. I think its going to quickly become one of my favorites from dillinger
p8445
aVI personally started on Ire Works, pretty solid album IMO.
p8446
aVOne Of Us Is The Killer is their most accessible album, I'd say work backwards from there.
p8447
aVThat's what I did. No ragrets.
p8448
aVI'm fond of Option Paralysis's first few tracks. Farewell, Mona Lisa. Good Neighbor. And Gold Teeth on a Bum.
p8449
aV"Widower" is my favorite track from Option Paralysis. It builds up so perfectly to such an incredible chorus.
p8450
aVOne of my favorite songs of all time
p8451
aV"43% Burnt"  from "Calculating Infinity" gives you a pretty good understanding of what DEP is all about. For an overall cleaner sound I would try their single "Milk Lizard" off the album "Ire Works".
p8452
aVIre Works then Option Paralysis then Miss Machine then One of Us Is the Killer. Do it in that order then randomly pick whatever albums are left. Only do it this way because I told you so. 
p8453
aVDo what this guy says (only because that's also the order I did it and I don't appear to have died)
p8454
aVI feel that TDEP won't "click" until you hear a full album.  Try Ire Works all the way through and see how you enjoy it.  
p8455
aVCan't go wrong with with Ire Works, Option Paralysis, or One of Us is the Killer. I think I'd recommend One of Us first, as I think it's their best album by far. \u000a\u000aAlso, if you're a Mike Patton fan, they did an EP together - Irony is a Dead Scene - which is equal parts awesome DEP, and awesome Patton. 
p8456
aVIn my opinion Option Paralysis is their most cohesive and most progressive album. It's also my absolute favorite(of any band ever). Each song is a masterpiece and the whole thing is just the most dynamic record I've ever heard.\u000a\u000aIt took me a lot of time to really get into Calculating Infinity, because it is SO extremely experimental and complex, but now I love it, too. But Option Paralysis was easier. Although It got better and better, because it revealed more and more aspects of itself.\u000a\u000aEach album is great and a masterpiece in it's own way, but in my opinion calculating infinity is the best for pure mathcore and Option Paralysis is the best for pure dynamic math/prog
p8457
aVDEP, haven't heard that name for a long time. I can't remember the song titles unfourtunaly buuuut... I can share you a quick story from their gig.\u000a\u000aI was like 19 y/o when Dillinger visited my city. Without thinking I bought a ticket, gathered my friends and went there. We were so hyped up as we've saw on youtube how wild their gigs could be. During their third song everyone went nuts- wall of death etc. Then the vocalist decided to run from stage on our heads (literally stepping on our heads). I had the bruise on my forehead for like 3 weeks. I didn't care- BEST.GIG.EVER.  I wish you good luck on your journey, young fellow : )

aVYep pretty much! I don't mind Grace either. \u000a\u000aI still think it's very strange that you pick that track as a teaser for an upcoming album though. Quite cool that the voice is Katherine Jenkins. 
p8480
aVWell, he also dropped the title track first on iTunes which is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more accessible for a teaser. Perfect Life is meant to show more of the album's theme to go along with the blog that he's made.\u000a\u000aHe's made way weirder music in the past. Look up his first solo album Insurgentes and his Bass Communion stuff.

p8510
aV*'So many reasons why one should never entertain the taste of scarlet.'*\u000a\u000aThis sounds pretty relevant to the Juggernaut Alpha cover with the birthing rite involving blood. Possibly Scarlet and the blood spilled by those observing the birthing rite are synonymous? 
p8511
aVYeah, alot of lyrics seem to fit in well. "slave thats born in a dark world of disease". to "selfish lies, i'm diseased" from Stranger Things. Also, "scarlet robes and sadistic minds surround me" from Heavy Heart.
p8512
aVMy mind is blowing so much linking the lyrics of Scarlet to this concept, holy shit.
p8513
aVThere's a theory explained in the comment section. Thanks to "InLovingMemoryOfficial" for the posible meaning behind this awesome (and funny) clip:\u000a"It looks like the video game grants him the ability to view past memories/troubles.  His life seems to be displayed linearly on the street with all the identical houses, each one representing a different time in his life. As he moves from house to house, he views different negative memories and mistakes, progressively moving forward in time.  He eventually reaches present day, where his virtual self meets with his real life self.  Some crazy stuff happens and he now seems to be able to go back and fix everything that went wrong (catching the trophy before it breaks, not flipping out on his parents, not driving drunk).  then at the end i guess he sort of just comes to and realizes what happened? any other thoughts?\ufeff"
p8514
aVUm yeah all that explained was the obvious parts... 
p8515
aVwell the game he is playing is called rainbow gravity, which is a theory on how the universe came to be.  The game is a lot like the theory in the way it plays.

aVThanks
p8528
aVThis sucks so hard.
p8529
aVSeriously, The song structure is so bland compared to what these guys have come out with in the past. The song pacing is so boring too, its basically verse-chorus-verse-chorus-instrumental break-chorus-hur dur breaks etc. Plus it sticks in 4/4 the entire time so I don't get how this could be considered prog. I really don't get why everyone still has such a huge hard on for this band
p8530
aV&gt; I really don't get why everyone still has such a huge hard on for this band\u000a\u000aBecause taste is subjective. \u000a\u000aYou can croon all you like about how think people only like them because they're the 'in' thing but most people are just going to look at you and not give a flying fuck over your opinion, because that's all it is, an opinion. \u000a\u000aI could say the exact same thing, wondering why people get such a hard on for ripping on an obviously popular band, because you want to know what IS objective? Success. \u000a\u000aRipping on a band because they're successful just makes you look like a fucking prick, especially finding threads that are quite obviously in support of said band.  I suppose you can go start your own thread saying how much you hate the album, but don't be surprised if you get literally no response except from people who want to join you in your echo chamber. \u000a\u000aBut hey,  what do I know,  I like periphery and i'm a big fan, so not like you're going to give a fuck about my wall of text either, but I don't care. \u000a\u000aI just wanted to waste 5 minutes typing out a rather long and drawn out 'fuck you.'
p8531
aVDon't worry. If you read what he said, you'll realize that he probably didn't even listen to the song cause it's literally all incorrect.
p8532
aVI like their unique aspects but i don't like the fall out boy style of singing.
p8533
aVWhat I was getting at was that it's ok to dislike a band, it's subjective.\u000a\u000aWhat I have beef with though is people deliberately posting trash talk in threads that quite obviously support the band in question.\u000a\u000aI could sit in an emo or punk subreddit all day and post about how much I hate punk, but that's both a waste of my time and only serves to make me look like a prick with a superiority complex.\u000a\u000atl;dr you can dislike a band, but the people that do like a band don't really care for you gassing about hating them.
p8534
aVI actually agree with his criticism. Not that I can't still enjoy what they offer.
p8535
aVDefinitely not 4/4 the entire time, makes me think you didn't even listen to it. The last half alternates between 7/4 and 8/4. The chorus alternates between 8/4 and 7/4. \u000a\u000aYour layout of "verse chorus verse chorus instrumental chorus hur dur" doesn't even take into account the last half of the song. It's okay to not like the band, but your literally wrong with everything you said. Not the opinion part, but the facts.\u000a\u000aedit: Even the verses aren't entirely in 4/4. They cut a beat out before the "wanting what you never have" parts.
p8536
aVPeriphery only plays in 4/4. Ask misha.
p8537
aVAnything can be 4/4 if you count whacky enough.

aV'Just slap some drums on top, add a backbeat, call it a day' \u000a\u000a4/4 would compose again. 
p8541
aVNot ALWAYS but frequently I'd estimate.
p8542
aVPeriphery doesn't play only in 4/4, but mostly yeah
p8543
aVCaptain On is not in 4/4, and is one of the smoothest odd time signatures you will hear. Other songs have much more obvious sections that are not 4/4. The 7/8 solo section in Have a Blast, for example. 
p8544
aVCaptain on is very much in 4/4 dude. Sections may "sound" like the time signatures are changing, but that's what periphery does. I'm listening to captain on right now. 1-2-3-4. 1-2-3-4.
p8545
aV[deleted]
p8546
aVGo back to the beginning and count with me when the rhythm section comes in. It's 5(2+3)+4+4. Or 5/8+8/8. It changes to 4/4 at the breakdown around 1 minute, and then switches back. \u000a\u000aIt may sound like 4/4 to you because it's very smooth, but it's actually 13/8. You just gotta count.
p8547
aVSorry dude. Misha wrote it. He says it's in 4/4. Count the drums. 
p8548
aV/u/iambulb want to shed some light for us?
p8549
aVThe drums aren't in 4/4 either, there is no 4/4 backbeat anywhere. I'm not sure what you're counting but the only time that song is in 4/4 is the breakdown. The rest is 13/8. If you count the drums they pretty clearly outline this. 
p8550
aVI'm beginning to think, due to your username and insistence on strangely incorrect info, that you're a troll account. In which case, you're doing a pretty good job! 6/6, would get mildly frustrated reading your comments again.
p8551
aVNice try deflecting. But you're not more correct then the person who wrote the music. Sorry.
p8552
aVOh, most of the second section of 'Alpha' is not in 4/4 and is in a sort of half time, or 'straight' 7/8.  They also use this throughout the first half of the track as a cool little tag in the verse when the drums go into half time.  There are probably more examples on Juggernaut as well, but I've only listened to it twice.\u000a\u000aI definitely agree that Periphery mostly write in 4/4 and are known for utilizing a 4/4 pulse over oddly timed riffs, but to say that they only write in 4/4 is ridiculous and there are a number of examples of them using odd times.
p8553
aVExactly my thoughts. PI was okay I guess, a few songs were really great but as a whole, not so much. PII was great as a whole, but no song really stood out. Now they've gone full pop-whore.
p8554
aVYeah... This album is far less prog than P2. Such a shame
p8555
aVI disagree and would say that this is the most progressive album they've made. Re-occuring themes and riffs extending over the course of an 80 minute album, including an 11 minute Omega that goes through at least 3 separate phases. The album still maintains syncopated rhythms, time signature changes and theoretically complex music, cornerstones of progressive metal. Whilst P1 and P2 had the latter they had nothing like the extensive overarching picture that *Juggernaut* which is a huge progressive feature in itself.
p8556
aVsong structure is too formulaic tho.
p8557
aVYou need to go back to P2 and double check those structures, tho.\u000a\u000a**Songs with Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus**\u000a\u000aFacepalm Mute\u000a\u000aScarlet\u000a\u000aMake Total Destroy (plus a pre-bridge, I s'pose)\u000a\u000aErised (plus epilogue extension)\u000a\u000a\u000aThere's *plenty* of simple-structured songs on Periphery's back catalog, Icarus Lives + Jetpacks + All New Materials + Captain On.\u000a\u000aPerhaps *more importantly*, complicated song structures is just ONE possible element of progressive music. Yes, Language by The Contortionist is amazing in its elaborate song layout, but Animals as Leaders' Joy of Motion doesn't have a ton of complicated structures to the songs, yet no one is denying that it's progressive music. Plenty of other elements of the albums are amazingly complex.
p8558
aVCaptain On is so weird but so good, considering it's only 1 riff
p8559
aVEach to their own. I'd agree looking at the songs separately it's not the proggiest but if every song was proggy on the record it would end up being incredibly tiresome to listen to. Not to mention with the storyline how disjointed the album as a whole would feel.
p8560
aVI honestly don't understand why they are so popular - every time I try listening to Periphery, they sound like all of the other generic emo-core bands out there. Whats their distinction? How are they different? 
p8561
aVIt's because they're complicated without being obnoxious about it. Listen to something like [Captain On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jkaUUzugdY), which feels so smooth and even despite the fact that it's in 13. You don't even notice.\u000a\u000aThe music is accessible to a casual listen, but stands up in complexity to intense scrutiny. Spencer is admittedly a divisive aspect to the band, but it is impressive that he manages to figure out catchy (or 'poppy', for people who insist on using that term as if it's something derogatory) melodies to go over strange chord progressions, atypical meters, and angular riffs.\u000a\u000aIs it as immediately noticeably complex as BTBAM or The Contortionist or TYS or PtH? No, because usually there's a quarter note pulse somewhere that you can latch on to and bob your head to, so it seems 'simple'. And that single layer is indeed simple, hence the accessibility to casual listeners. But there's a ton of crazy shit going on with every other layer.
p8562
aVA bit late to the party on this, but I have been a HUGE fan of Periphery II and the Clear EP and did not notice how frequently they are outside of 4/4 until I started listening to A/O. I can't stop spinning A/O, there's just so much amazing instrumentals coupled with great vocal hooks. Anyways, I totally agree with everything that you just said and have only realized it lately.
p8563
aVThis is probably one of the most "poppy" songs they made. They have loads of heavier  and proggier stuff. Check out the song Omega and tell me they're just another emo band. 
p8564
aVI don't know... I've done that, and even saw them live a couple of times. They just seem like the Katy Perry of Death/Metalcore to me.
p8565
aVDude they're just a poor man's between the buried and me, everyone is just riding the hype train it's bound to stop soon.\u000a\u000aEdit: words.
p8566
aV*they're\u000a\u000a*man's\u000a\u000a*it's\u000a\u000aAnd they're quite different from BTBAM, comparing bands that are very dissimilar just because they're in the same genre is silly. Is BTBAM a poor man's Tool? No, that's apples and oranges, silly comparison, as is this one.
p8567
aVNo Tool and Between The Buried and Me would be some what of a silly comparison to some extent, but you could compare them. That's why we have the yearly top album of the year. It would be red apple to green apple. 
p8568

p8589
aVIt seems like PRS knows this target demographic well. Dustie Waring, Mark Holcomb, Aaron Marshall, Sithu Aye, Misha has a modern eagle, lending out semi-hollows S2 to Taylor and Spence. So many 'modern' guitar guys are playing these instruments that it will influence the buying decision of a beginnee kid who's listening to all this music. And the fact that they recently put out an even cheaper SE line, PRS is playing all its cards right. I'm looking forward to seeing what they have in store at NAMM 2015.

asVCan this be progressive? [Krallice - Telluric Rings]
p8611
(lp8612
VKrallice is ridiculously progressive. Years Past Matter is quite possibly my favorite black metal album ever.
p8613
aV...Why? Serious question. I found it completely boring and worthless compared to their other three. It was like they had no good ideas left. 
p8614
aVUpon my first couple of listens it honestly felt impenetrable. However, after a few more it started to open up. I just love the interplay between the two guitars so much on that album. I also felt the production was stronger than on any of their previous albums. Of course, it's all subjective, but that's my two cents on it.
p8615
aVI thought the production on "Dimensional Bleedthrough", "Diotima" and "Years Past Matter" was so similar that if you shuffled all three albums together on a playlist, a new listener would have no idea which songs came from which album. The guitar interplay is certainly one of the many things that makes Krallice great, but I thought that worked itself out best in their earlier stuff (the pinnacle being the final 5 minutes of "Forgiveness in Rot"). 
p8616
aVYou make good points. Ultimately though, there's just something about YPM that resonates with me. Krallice has such a raw approach to songwriting and their sound in general that it has that sort of unnamable quality to it that draws you in like that. And if it doesn't work, then it just doesn't work.
p8617
aVI had the same reaction. But after some more listens, it became quite enjoyable, and honestly I like it as much as any of their others.\u000a

aVI'm still hoping that someday we will see a Twelve Foot Ninja/Shaolin Death Squad collaboration or at least a split. I mean, it's right there. Just think of the potential.

VDude always had some cool ideas/licks, too bad Marilyn never let him do more than octaves and bar chords...
p8645
aVI always say having John 5 in Marilyn Manson was like owning a Magnum and using it to hammer nails.
p8646
aVI love his precision. He knows how to give structure to a musical piece, and that there's more to the modern metal than just playing odd rhythm on a djent stick. And that we don't need to hear the guitar from the beginning to the end. The guitar is completely absent for the first 40 seconds, and the main theme doesn't appear until the 1'30 mark. I don't know many guitarists that are able to be so patient... especially in instrumental songs.
p8647
aV&gt;The guitar is completely absent for the first 40 seconds \u000a\u000aWhat you are hearing is a guitar, actually.
p8648
aVI love a lot of his tracks that are heavily doused in southern twang, too.
p8649
aVApparently one of his favorite genres is bluegrass. I think he's done studio sessions for a few country bands.
p8650
aVHis wikipedia mentions he's been involved with [Lynyrd Skynyrd](http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/lynyrd-skynyrd-write-with-john-5-set-album-for-2009-170949)\u000a\u000aThe album is [Gods &amp; Guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_%26_Guns)

The single "Still Unbroken" was released on July 27, 2009 followed by another track, "Simple Life", on August 4, 2009. [Hughie Thomasson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughie_Thomasson) contributed to the writing of many songs, including this first single, before his death. "Still Unbroken" was written after the death of original bassist [Leon Wilkeson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Wilkeson) in 2001.  The album features guitar work from [John 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_5_(guitarist\u005c)).

VWow the way those drums help drive the guitar line in the chorus is crazy cool. What a sonic punch! Love the dynamic post rock-esque break in the middle too. Holy shit this is fun for my ears. 
p8655
aVIf you want more of that, this song has a great drum/guitar dynamic with a super-slow breakdown in the middle which is awesome.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IYr9N8jbmM\u000a\u000aPlenty of awesome drums in their back catalog too ;)

p8660
aVAwesome.\u000aNice RG927, how do you like it?
p8661
aVLove it. Not a huge fan of the trem, but it holds better than a floyd, and it can be fun to mess around with. Fretwork is top notch, neck is comfy, it doesn't quite hold up to a prestige, but it is an awesome work horse.
p8662
aVST. ANDREW'S DETROIT. YEEEEAAAHHHHH

aVCheers brother! (Or sister I'm sorry I can't tell through the Internet)

aVThank you!
p8668
aVGood show chap
p8669
aVGreat job man. That song is quite tricky. I've tried learning it and I can't get my head around the intro, mostly because I can't find a good tab. Could you show me? :) 
p8670
aVGuitar pro is your friend! 
p8671
aVThat may have been the cleanest cover I've ever seen, I envy you.\u000a
p8672
aVThank you!
p8673
aVHow much did the setup cost?? Sick cover dude, nailed it! 
p8674
aVThanks! Let's see here, not including the iPad and the laptop, positive grid's apps are usually $20 a piece, and I use them with a scarlet 2i2 and Cubase LE7 (bundled together via sweetwater.com, this cost $250). The speakers were $125 each. So somewhere around $550 for everything. This is ridiculously cheap for a studio of any caliber, yet it wields such awesome sounds! 
p8675
aVwow that's insane, I would've never guessed such great sound could be so cheap. Thanks!
p8676
aVCould you post how you have your Bias preset going? I can't get mine to sound even close to as good. 
p8677
aVThe key (I've found) to an awesome sounding tone is to first and foremost double track the guitars, pan left and right, then eq the fuck out of them! Cubase makes it easy to do all of this. 
p8678
aVDude this was awesome! Post this on /r/Peripheryband !

aVMust inquire about your procurement of Jake's pickups.
p8680
aVAllow me to answer as I was there when he bought them. Jake was selling them at the merch table during Summer Slaughter 2012. They were like $150, so it was a great deal, and they're fucking Jake Bowen's pickups. \u000a\u000aAlso he promised to demo them with this cover after he installed them if that gives you any idea of how much a procrastinator this guy is. 
p8681
aVYup, pretty much sums it up. Thanks Josh! Buttersnips cover coming in 2018. 
p8682
aVimpressive cover but you should really invest in some better monitors

asV"Owane" - Saturday Jam #3 ... This kid deserves some of our attention
p8684
(lp8685
VYes he does... I wish there was more of, well, anything he's done. Hasn't been any news for 7 months. I'm convinced he's Jakub Zytecki's cousin or something, even looks vaguely like him.\u000a\u000aI really like the Saturday Jam #1, too, that was originally how I'd stumbled across him, a video of Maciej Dzik from Disperse [playing through it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31TA5yRQ6E), such a nice song. Apparently Maciej is doing drums for Owane's album, but who knows when that'll be...
p8686
aVI got a JZ / Disperse vibe from this too.\u000a\u000aReally great work, will definitely keep checking on this guy.
p8687
aVHe hasnt posted anything in a while! :( hopefully more is coming lol
p8688
aVI know the guy, I'll ask him to post more!
p8689
aVHe posted a response to a comment on jam 1 a few months ago saying he's working on an EP.
p8690
aVSaw the 7-string and was expecting some typical djenty riffs...but was pleasantly surprised. This guy is fantastic
p8691
aVYes he absolutely is! His taste is unreal
p8692
aVThis is like if Dirty Loops had a guitarist instead of a vocalist. Very cool.
p8693
aVYeah, got a bunch of dirty loops vibes from this
p8694
aVWow, really impressive. Loved what he created there! I can't believe he stated that he doesn't know any of the theory behind his composition. What an ear! I can definitely hear a David Maxim Micic influence there too. \u000a\u000ahey, I luv u. Wanna b my girlfriend? \u000a\u000aK. \u000a\u000a\u000aHaha adorable. 
p8695
aVMan, his technique is gorgeous. I would definitely rock an album of this.
p8696
aVSounds a lot like Plini, it's great! \u000a\u000aWhat's that thing on the top of his guitar though? I always see people with that but no one really explains what it is.
p8697
aVIt's to avoid string noise. I play an 8-string guitar myself and I have a similar improvised contraption close to the end of my neck. It's really helpful if you don't want any random open strings to start resonating while you're playing, and that's bound to happen with that many strings. With a 6-string guitar your palm is big enough to mute most of the strings but that won't do the job when you've got 8 strings.
p8698
aVIt's just his sock being used as a capo lol
p8699
aVHaha ah that helps a bit then. Sometimes you see them having some kind of felt thing on the top that isn't on any fret though. I guess it limits the feedback or something, but I never really found a product or anything that comes close to those things.
p8700
aVAwesome!\u000aEven more awesome for the poor-man's sock capo! :)
p8701
aVWhatever works right!? :P

asVClick to vote for Round 9 in /r/progmetal's Hall of Fame
p8704
(lp8705
V&gt;Protest the Hero\u000a\u000aEvery single member of the band is a technical wizard, but most importantly I think they're the most fun and distinct band on that list. The problem is that the list is only 10 bands long and I can't think of a reason to bump Cynic and Animals as Leaders off there considering how influential both of them are.
p8706
aVYou can sure as hell bump Periphery.\u000a\u000aNothing against Protest the Hero, though. I just got a copy of Scurrilous in December and already listened to it about nine million times.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Oh, shit. I accidentally dissed Periphery. 
p8707
aVHuge fan of heaps of those bands but for me it's gotta be Symphony X! A lot of the others are more of a new generation in my eyes, which I think should have its own hall of fame in about a decade haha.
p8708
aVYou and me both brother!
p8709
aVWhoa whoa whoa. Symphony X aren't already in the Hall of Fame?\u000a\u000aAnd Ayreon?!
p8710
aVEvery time we do a new round, this comment shows up (for x band(s)). \u000a\u000aJust think about the bands they'd have to replace in order to make the list. Every current band that's been voted in is a giant of the genre and holds a deserving spot. 
p8711
aVHey, I'm not complaining. It was meant in good humour. It's nice that we have such a diverse genre with such incredible depth that there are so many candidates that are so deserving of a place. 
p8712
aVGotcha.
p8713
aVSorry, I just want to clarify.\u000a\u000aThe Hall of Fame is limited to so many spots so if a new band is to be inaugurated into it they have to *replace* another well-deserving band? Or is the Hall of Fame a list that we can simply *add* new, well-deserving bands to?\u000a\u000aI think I know the answer is the latter but your wording suggests the former.
p8714
aVYou are correct on that it's the latter. Our current plan is to stop at 10 bands (for now). \u000a\u000aWhat I meant by saying "think about the bands they'd have to replace," I was trying to get at the fact that if someone is surprised that a band has not been voted in *yet,* then that would imply that necessarily one of the current bands would have to have lost the spot in order for the unvoted band to be in the list at this very time. 
p8715
aVAh, I see. I was just curious if there was some arbitrary decision to stop at the current number and I just missed it somehow. Eight would be an unusual number to pause at although ten would be leaving out huge names in the scene still, it seems a good point to pause for a while.\u000a\u000aThanks for explaining.
p8716
aVHaken all the way
p8717
aVI *almost* voted for Haken. I didn't because in my opinion they're too young of a band to be in a *hall of fame*. They've only been making music for 4 years (3 LPs and 1 EP).
p8718
aVi'm curious, that's only one LP less than Tool have released. Considering the strength of all three of Hakens LPs and the EP as well, what is the reason that Tool have made "enough" music, but Haken haven't?
p8719
aVI'm not OP but my guess would be the Tool has been making music for 25 years, even though they've only had 4 albums + Opiate. Haken, from my minuscule research, has been making music for 8 years. I personally don't mind either way but that could be his/her logic.
p8720
aVI guess that's true, although they haven't made any for the past 8 years too.
p8721
aVYeah haha, with no end in sight.
p8722
aVRiverside is my first choice.\u000aHaken would be second. \u000a\u000aI am not a fan of too much "djent" except for Tesseract and maybe Animals as Leaders. \u000aWhy is that once a band picks up a Guitar of 7 strings or more does it have be "djent" ?
p8723
aVI'm actually not a fan of djent either, but the reality is that it's fused into what's considered prog metal, for better or for worse, and that's not about to change. That doesn't mean we're (the mods) going to turn a blind eye to it and pretend it isn't legitimate, though. I think most of us don't really care for djent, but again, that doesn't matter one way or another in regards to how we run the place. 
p8724
aVNot complaining about this sub ;) . Just a general observation of prog metal and increasing popularity of djent over "traditional" progmetal like DT, Symphony X, Ayreon over the past 4 years or so. \u000a\u000aIf ya got 7+ strings ...use them all equally ;)
p8725
aVIn regards to your last comment I think you'd be surprised by a lot of the material a band like Periphery (kind of the flagship for the whole "djent" thing) has. Some of it is chuggy and overly rhythmic, but there's a lot of melodic playing and intricate harmony in many of their parts. I don't mean this in a negative way toward you and totally respect you may not like their sound but the whole open string chug chug chug is only a small piece of their sound. PII is probably the best album to listen to for guitar work that goes beyond what most people think of as djent, and PI has a lot of cool stuff too.
p8726
aVYeah Periphery claim to bring djent out into the open, but they hardly play open note-fret #1 on the lowest string constantly. Bands like Periphery and Animals As Leaders use it as part of the composition but I think what bothers many people is the over use and composing around the "djent" sound rather than use it as a part or addition to the music itself.  \u000a  \u000aWhile they have their fans, bands like Volumes, really oversimplify their sound and can deter some people to categorize as "djent is bad."
p8727
aVAnimals as Leaders! Rockin' it out since the debut
p8728
aVI voted for Haken, Sikth, Intronaut and AAL.
p8729
aVIt's more than likely bound to be Periphery. Just from their popularity alone over the past years and the release of Juggernaut still ringing in listeners' ears today would propel them to get the most votes.
p8730
aVSince Juggernaut was released I haven't listened to anything close as much, but I still didn't vote for them...\u000a\u000aVoted for sikth and pth, but I don't think any of them is gonna be it :/
p8731
aVThe thing with periphery is that they're so new compared to any other band in the hall of fame.  I think influence is something to be considered.  Also, they're so new that we don't know if they might lose favor over the next few albums and in the future might be not looked on for their good influence.
p8732
aVYeas active should be a consideration but what is a good measurement? Number of albums, 5 years active, 6 years active? 
p8733
aVThere's a lot of bands on this list with only a couple albums. Not sure why they are even included.
p8734
aVThey're included because they were nominated. 
p8735
aVUgh. Cynic v AAL v Ihsahn v Intronaut? Youre killing me, r/progmetal. 
p8736
aVI would have voted for The Human Abstract, but I kind of feel like Midheaven made them undeserving of it. Digital Veil was just worlds better.
p8737
aV^(I liked Midheaven)
p8738
aVMidheaven isn't horrible. It's just not very good either.
p8739
aVIt was....\u000a\u000aIt was pretty god damn bad.\u000a\u000aNocturne was an absolute fucking masterpiece however.
p8740
aVI liked Digital Veil better. IMO the non-harsh (not exactly clean either; I guess I'd call them aggressive cleans) vocals on Nocturne were a bit hard to listen to. But the shredding on that album was unreal.
p8741
aVI'm actually a pretty big fan of Nocturne's vocals. They're almost like hardcore, and I haven't really heard anything else like them.
p8742
aVhey don't hate on midheaven, it's not as bad as everyone says it is\u000a\u000aI totally voted The Human Abstract though, still a bit early for some bands like The Contortionist and Animals As Leaders
p8743
aVMy thoughts exactly with The Contortionist and AAL. They'll have plenty of time, and with three albums each, there's definitely a ways to go for them.\u000a\u000aAlthough I did vote for Periphery, despite the fact that their first album came out in 2010. But they're still a 10-year-old band, so I think they're a fair choice for Hall of Fame.
p8744
aVYeah, Midheaven sucked. I love Nocturne and Digital Veil though. The thing for me is though, is a band with only two noteworthy albums who are no longer even active really deserving of a hall of fame spot? Let me reiterate, I fucking LOVE THA. But I just don't think they quite reached that level. Which is a damn shame, because they absolutely could have.
p8745
aVThey also had an EP, so I guess they're sort of qualified. But I definitely think they had influence on bands like Art By Numbers and others who followed the neoclassical style.
p8746
aVI'm torn between my want for classic bands to get recognition, and my desire to see bands who get posted here constantly get blacklisted haha. Voted for Voivod in the end, really I think they deserve the spot more than anyone: 13 studio albums, dating back to 1984, creating noisey jazzy metal when noone else was, noone did anything similar to them until years later. 
p8747
aVFriendly reminder that you guys still haven't done a write up for Porcupine Tree...
p8748
aVUhh.. But we have. 
p8749
aV:S so sorry. I only remember the last post being you saying you couldn't find anyone to do it. Must have missed it! 
p8750
aVNo problem. We kind of put it up rather quietly. 
p8751
aVCynic is still not in the Hall of Fame? Very surprising
p8752
aVEnslaved or GTFO. \u000a\u000aI voted for Ayreon though. Nothing else on the list is half as deserving.
p8753
aVCan't tell if this is a joke comment because uh.... Fates Warning? Psychotic Waltz? Queensryche? Cynic? Watchtower? Not half as deserving as Ayreon? 
p8754
aVFates Warning and Queensryche aren't that good, Cynic is overhyped and had a huge dead period, and I've never even heard of PW and Watchtower. Ayreon has a six-album (including multiple double albums) concept spanning thirteen years, plus a wealth of other material both with Ayreon and related projects. 
p8755
aV&gt;Fates Warning and Queensryche aren't that good\u000a\u000aSubjective and overall worthless as a critique. \u000a\u000a&gt;Cynic is overhyped\u000a\u000aSubjective again and unanalytical, again. \u000a\u000a&gt;and had a huge dead period\u000a\u000aWhy does that have anything to do with how influential or definitive a band is?\u000a\u000a&gt;I've never even heard of PW and Watchtower.\u000a\u000aI'm afraid this is no one's fault but yours. It would be more worthwhile to do some research rather than blindly discount insanely important bands. \u000a\u000a&gt;Ayreon has a six-album (including multiple double albums) concept spanning thirteen years, plus a wealth of other material both with Ayreon and related projects.\u000a\u000aIt seems you're basing your standards off of the pure volume of content a band has released? That doesn't make much sense. \u000a\u000aAyreon is a great project, and like Bujjick, I'd have no problem seeming them in the HoF. But I'm sorry, they just aren't as important or influential as you're making them out to be. That's not even comparing them to all of the bands I listed off. 
p8756
aVDid you miss the part about it being a six-album *concept suite*? \u000a\u000aIt's not just about quantity, obviously. But quantity matters. Quality matters. FAME matters. Progressiveness matters. If Dream Theater wouldn't exist without Fates Warning, does that mean Iron Maiden should be in the HoF? \u000a\u000aTo me, the prog metal hall of fame should be about who represents the genre of progressive metal the best and the brightest. Ayreon is that. 
p8757
aV&gt;Did you miss the part about it being a six-album concept *suite*?\u000a\u000aI could theoretically write and release a six-album concept *suite* of my own. But the virtue of the fact alone that I've done this doesn't really mean anything. \u000a\u000aFame doesn't necessarily matter at all, in my opinion. Well, it matters in the sense that naturally the most famous bands *will* make this list--that's just how voting works. Please familiarize yourself with the Hall of Fame's purpose: "[bands that are] hugely influential and/or essential to the genre of progressive metal." No where is fame in and of itself a constituent in order to meet this. A band can be as obscure as the dying sun and they can still easily have a place in our list (whether or not they have a chance of getting in is another question altogether). These same things apply to bands with a small backlog of material. In some cases, all it takes is one album. \u000a\u000a&gt;Progressiveness matters.\u000a\u000aThat it does. Which is why it's bizarre that you don't favour any of the bands I listed off earlier. Those are the very bands that literally invented the genre and represent the meaning of progressiveness in its truest original sense--and frankly, it's hard to engage in a discussion like this when you haven't even heard of some of them. \u000a\u000a&gt;If Dream Theater wouldn't exist without Fates Warning, does that mean Iron Maiden should be in the HoF?\u000a\u000aWhy would it? Fates Warning and Dream Theater are both progressive metal bands. This is a list for progressive metal. Iron Maiden is not progressive metal. I don't understand the purpose of this question. \u000a\u000a&gt;To me, the prog metal hall of fame should be about who represents the genre of progressive metal the best and the brightest. Ayreon is that.\u000a\u000aAnother utterly subjective statement that could easily be replaced with X band for any given person. \u000a\u000a 
p8758
aVYou're missing just how influential all those bands you're dismissing are/were.  Not to discredit Ayreon cause I'd be perfectly happy to have him in the hall of fame, but each of those other bands is far more historically important.
p8759
aVThe fact that you don't know Psychotic Waltz while knowing Ayreon so weird.  Ya know Agony from The Human Equation?  That's Devon Graves (Buddy Lackey) and his main band used to be Psychotic Waltz.  Also, Ayreon's albums aren't all the same concept, so that makes I sense to say six album concept.\u000a\u000aAlso, Watchtower is a very influential band in the prog metal genre.  Influence is one of the most important factors in a hall of fame contest.  It's your fault you don't know them.  What if someone doesn't know Tool and says that's why they shouldn't be in the hall of fame?  It's a shitty reason to say they aren't deserving when your ignorance is the cause.
p8760
aVWell what do you know. Thanks for pointing that out.\u000a\u000a"The Final Experiment", "Into the Electric Castle", "Universal Migrator" parts 1 and 2, "The Human Equation", and "01011001" are actually all part of the same storyline. So, yeah, six album concept suite.
p8761
aVWell, that's interesting.  They all are pretty much different, but I guess Arjen maybe said they're the same universe.  I guess it's a six album suite, but it would be hard to say it's the same concept.  So were both right, it just depends on personal definitions.
p8762
aVThey're quite definitively linked together in plot and general theme (whether you consider that "concept" might I guess differ. They're definitively part of the same story): the message that's sent back in *The Final Experiment* is the same war that *Universal Migrator* is telling the story of the last people surviving; *Y* tells the story of why the war happened (Aliens!), *Electric Castle* (released 10 years prior) introduces said aliens. Human equation is the only one that's more tenuously linked, it could be more considered a side-story in the same world (it's driven by the same reason that was explained in the track "Forever of the Stars" in *Electric Castle* - spoilers and all).\u000a\u000aWhere they all were only tenuously linked together until it's release, *Y* (01011001 is binary for Y) linked them all together conclusively, and has many explicit and direct links to basically every other album.
p8763
aVWhere is Rush?
p8764
aVNot nominated and rarely considered progressive metal. 
p8765
aVWhat!!!!!!?\u000a\u000aCan't rush be considered part of the influence for the genre?\u000a\u000aThey even have an entry in the Metal Archives!
p8766
aVI'm not necessarily against their inclusion, I'm just attempting to justify why they're likely not in the list. \u000a\u000aAs well, because this is a very limited list (currently set at 10 bands), there isn't much leeway as far as adding bands that haven't strictly released prog metal. \u000a
p8767
aVRush are in a somewhat awkward spot when it comes to the history of progressive music. They are neither part of the original British prog scene nor part of the scene create progressive metal, which was mostly US-American. And yet, they have gained considerable mainstream success and their influence is unparalleled.
p8768
aVListen to side 1 of 2112, Cygnus X1 and Cygnus X1 Book II. Most badass songs of the 70's. One could also argue that because they were Dream Theater's biggest influence, they deserve to be in there.

p8771
aVYe that was amazing, but he wasn't the only one doing it and none blame him for it. His playing style and technique is amazing anyways, it's just unfair he's so underrated. The concept of spoken voices in different languages driven album is an interesting concept. Considering it wouldn't be bad... since he's more original than like 40% of things posted here, seriously
p8772
aVI know it's not nominated but I get mad everytime he isn't even mentioned. Nice guys finish last :(
p8773
aVI'm sorry if you complain about it, but i went ahead to vote for Son of Aurelius, but they aren't on the list... ):
p8774
aVI've been following the creation of this "hall of fame" list on and off since it began and how come Gojira was not included in any context? not proggy enough? too much like death metal? they seem like a more fitting option than more than a couple of the current options
p8775
aVEvery band you see (or don't) is a reflection of who the community has or has not nominated. Nothing more than that. 
p8776
aVwhy wasn't dillinger ever included in here? They're as much prog metal as sikth *AND* are incredibly influential and original
p8777
aVbecause the community didn't nominate them? there was a nomination thread and these are the bands that the community nominated. we didn't decide.
p8778
aVoh... alrigh then :)

p8885
aVMy favorite intro track is Flying Sea Dragons from Spiritual Migration by Persefone. It gets me ready so ready for the album.
p8886
aVI really love how [SikTh - Summer Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyztHqZWkao) just explodes into that groovy riff.
p8887
aVThat riff is like the greatest thing ever.
p8888
aV[Cynic - Nunc Fluens] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQzcvtuc9BA)\u000a\u000awhich leads to Space for This.
p8889
aVThe intro track to Devin Townsend's "Deconstruction" blew me away and perfectly sets the tone of the record.\u000a\u000a
p8890
aVI love that slow fade in of the double bass on the drums. It goes from nice and peaceful to the insanity that is the rest of the album. So awesome.
p8891
aVSpeaking of **Devin Townsend**, "Effervescent!" which leads perfectly into "True North" really had me falling in love with Devin. His ability to do so many styles, so well, so honestly, while maintaing the essence of who he is, befuddles me. This man has to be schizophrenic. It's so different from his other, equally awesome stuff. 
p8892
aV&gt; This man has to be schizophrenic.\u000a\u000aNah he's just done a shit load of LSD.
p8893
aVGuess I should get on that.

aVOnce was enough for me. It's *really* wild.

aVhttp://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2rr3xs/i_wanna_see_your_favorite_interlude/\u000a\u000ayou might have missed this when searching since it's not a self post even though it's a discussion.\u000a\u000aas for me, one of my favorites is Swan Lake by The Agonist. it's an a capella performance by their vocalist who layered her voice multiple times. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsrkEmFUR4c)
p8896
aV[The Crusher](http://youtu.be/bNz0SbDsNoQ?t=6m14s), by Shadow Gallery, the second part of \u201cCliffhanger 2\u201d, from *Legacy*. My favourite fully instrumental interlude in prog metal. Not even the guys from DT have come close to building such an epic.
p8897
aVThe Ocean - Siderian. How it builds up to Rhyacian is amazing.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUMPf37vriA
p8898
aVI've recently really fallen for the intro of Gamma Ray's [Rebellion in Dreamland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9sTRjFHJn8). I have to listen to the first minute or so multiple times whenever I listen to it.

aV[Sumeria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvCwvfGJq_k)\u000a\u000aIt sounds like a guitar chainsaw! The start is so abrupt and awesome that I'm instantly hooked every single time!
p8901
aVTool - [Die Eier Von Satan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAhNEwcXypo)\u000a\u000a\u000aBecause a recipe for sugar cookies never sounded so metal. 
p8902
aVNot just sugar cookies. Hash cookies.
p8903
aVIn all prog metal I've been listening to recently, it would be Symphony X - Seven. Very fast, angry, and in-your-face.
p8904
aVDespite the fact that it is fairly long, I thought the intro to [**Nowena 9.10**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kX2HiyRs6o) **by Amenra** was perfect. The whole thing serves as the perfect contrast to the mind bending intensity of the rest of the song.
p8905
aVYes - [Starship Trooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKftiJS30Cs)
p8906
aVNot sure if this is my favorite but I think [Epipelagic](http://youtu.be/As8CbyJRPmU) by The Ocean does a perfect job of setting the mood of the album as well as blending seamlessly into the watery sounding note of the next song. I think it fits in even more when you take into consideration the album's concept of sinking deeper into the ocean/mind as it sounds like you're on the surface of the water (and in a cave for some reason).
p8907
aVThe last time this kind of thread was brought up, I mentioned my love of [Rishloo's "My Favorite Things"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UElrfsoFEo0) and [Cire's "Tryptamind"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELKUE1usUhg), so there they are again.\u000a\u000aAs far as intros to actual full songs go, ["Upgrade^Brigade" by Fair to Midland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt0Rzd0quFs) is so fulfilling, especially that last set of notes before the verse proper starts.
p8908
aVIf you consider the ending 2 minutes or so of Protest the Hero's Palms Read an interlude, than that is my favorite.
p8909
aVMost of my favourites have been mentioned already but ill add [Pelican - Glimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwEiynsDNQ0) and pretty much any intro by Cloudkicker
p8910
aVAlways liked [Conceit by Monuments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0NZQ01aB9k), it's got a nice pulse to it.
p8911
aVSome intros I like: Cloudkicker's God Be With Ye and Amy I Love You, AAL's On Impulse

p8931
aVYep!
p8932
aVHow was Ne Obliviscaris? I've missed them twice now because I'm not 18 yet :(
p8933
aVThey were really good - I only saw them at AAL's sidewave, but the energy they brought was great. I hadn't heard much from them beforehand, but they blew me away. Loved the violin dynamic and damn their screamer (name?) can scream for days lol.

aVNot really prog but here's what comes to my mind:\u000a\u000aSteve Vai - Building the Church\u000a\u000aJoe Satriani - Always with me Always with You\u000a\u000a[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpZ645ztl0) Chris Broderick Bet you can't play this\u000a\u000aand [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvyxn2kkEVY) Bet you can't play this by Andy Wood (which I think sounds better when it's played slower)
p8941
aVThe middle section in Sea of Lies by Symphony X. Eight finger tapping goodness.
p8942
aVNow you are going to make me listen to that whole album again. Thanks!
p8943
aV[Midnight by Joe Satriani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vW4XdezBr4) is always a winner. (Plus he looks ridiculous with hair!)
p8944
aVThe bridge in Spirals by Chimp Spanner.
p8945
aVPeriphery - Letter Experiment, just love how smooth and bouncy it sounds, until it all turns into a mess at the end.
p8946
aVAlways With Me, Always With You - Joe Satriani\u000a \u000areally sweet sounding tapping section in the solo, not too difficult to play
p8947
aVThe first chorus of Stranger Things by Periphery. Also, probably my favorite riff ever.
p8948
aVOn a different note to the songs posted here, I'd have to say John Myung's riff in the intro to [Scarred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6SjyRLKy70)
p8949
aVIvy and Wine by Glass Cloud, around the 1:44 mark:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmwcT7pjfKM
p8950
aVThe riff around 0:47 from [Periphery's Buttersnips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQPnVTSmuG8&amp;t=47) is the first thing  \u000athat came to my mind when reading the title, so eh.
p8951
aVSevens by Guthrie govan off of Erotic cakes. After the intro lead he starts the tapping...its amazing and so melodic.
p8952
aVThere was a little-known Christian prog death metal band in the early 2000s called Crutch (later Aletheian), and their guitarist Alex Kenis (who now plays in Solamors with the ex-vocalist of Becoming the Archetype) was one of my favorite guitarists growing up. His solo in ["Embrace the Beauty"](http://youtu.be/vSeg3tF8JOI?t=2m42s) is my favorite guitar solo ever, and features some incredible tapping. 
p8953
aVI really dig a lot of David Knudson's (Minus the Bear) riffs.  Guy writes some brilliant material.  Thanks for the Killer Game of Crisco Twister has a really cool riff that is played throughout most of the song.  \u000a\u000a[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-PM1IDCccs)

aVDefinitely don't forget Townsend!!! 
p8977
aVlol I assure you... I wasn't cheating! xD I'm glad a lot of people love Haken around here though. 
p8978
aVI know man, I'm kidding.  Haken is pretty beloved in the prog world. 
p8979
aVWell, I guess I'll fit in around here! :D
p8980
aVI sure hope you're listening to all of their albums and not just this EP.  I feel like it's missing something some of their other stuff has.   
p8981
aVNah, I've been listening to all of their stuff, don't worry. Honestly, though, "Crystallised" is still my favorite song right now. 
p8982
aVCelestial Elixir is one of my personal favorites.  It's got such a big epic sound and has some of the most memorable little hooks and jingles. 
p8983
aVYou are preaching to the choir man. I'm pretty sure everyone here on progmetal loves Haken :) \u000a\u000aYou should check Dream Theater in case you haven't, they are like Haken's fathers.
p8984
aVYeah, I can see that now! :) Haha I just subscribed a few hours ago and didn't see any posts about Haken, so I figured I'd give it a shot just in case they weren't getting the appreciation they deserve.
p8985
aVBtw, thanks for subbing! Enjoy your stay :)

aVNo problem, man! I already am. :)

p8988
aVReally? What is his band?
p8989
aVNext  to none 
p8990
aVI actually like Haken better
p8991
aVO yea, me too. But Haken is really similar to DT, they borrowed a lot of things and improved :) That's what i meant.
p8992
aVHaken is my favorite band! You should check out all of their other albums.  All of them are that good.  Personally my favorite songs by them are Falling Back to Earth and Streams, but that is constantly in flux.
p8993
aVYeah, I have listened to "The Mountain" and "Visions" all the way through, but not as much as I have with "Restoration." I'm gonna check out those two songs right now! :) 
p8994
aVHaken is a band where there is no wrong answer when somebody asks what your favorite song is.
p8995
aVSo I listened to those two songs. As soon as I played "Falling Back to Earth," I recognized it. I love that damn song... However, I think that was the first time I really heard "Streams." I really like it, too! I know what you mean, though, about there being no wrong answer. I have listened to all of their music and there isn't one song that I don't love! 
p8996
aVYou really should listen to Aquarius, their first album. Its probably my favorite and is much more prog metal than say The Mountain or Restoration which I feel is much more prog rock.\u000a\u000aThey can't do wrong though, I don't think there is a single piece of music they've written that I dislike.
p8997
aVI listened to it all yesterday and I definitely see why you love it. I'm listening again right now. It's fucking awesome, man. :)
p8998
aVI'm glad you liked it :)
p8999
aVYeah, I'll check that out as soon as I can.
p9000
aVAquarius is my favorite. It tells a story about a mermaid, sort of. It's very musically interesting/wonderful, imo. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKkycq9Suok)
p9001
aVYup. Listening right now. Love it!!!
p9002
aVListen for the story! It took me a few listens to figure out there was a story and a handful more to piece it together. It's my favorite album for now.
p9003
aVI'll listen while reading the lyrics when I get back home. I love concept albums. 
p9004
aVUpvote for Streams!
p9005
aVYep, we love it :-)\u000a\u000a\u000aI really haven't stopped listening to it since it came out, so much to absorb and it just keeps on giving haha. Haken is quickly rising to the top of my favorite bands list with their consistently solid albums that take awesome new directions.\u000a\u000aAnyways, glad you gave them a shot! Definitely check out their previous albums, starting with The Mountain, then working back to Visions and Aquarius.
p9006
aV&gt; Haken is quickly rising to the top of my favorite bands list with their consistently solid albums that take awesome new directions.\u000a\u000aIn the past month, I bought all their albums and I've been pretty much listening to nothing else (besides the new BG album).\u000a\u000aThe only thing I have to say is this: it's a shame there's only 3 full-length albums (although one could say Restoration is close enough to a fourth).  Nocturnal Conspiracy is probably my favorite track overall - the first ~5 minutes should be illegal.
p9007
aVI don't even count restoration as an ep. Rush has albums that are basically the same length, I think hemispheres is only 34 minutes long.
p9008
aVvery close, 36 minutes.
p9009
aVYeah they have risen to the top of my list of favorite bands within a week, which is faster than just about any other band ever has! :) 
p9010
aVRecently discovered them too! And I fell in love.\u000aI absolutely love that every member of this band sings. The Acappella part of "Because it's There" off "The Mountain", blows my mind.\u000a  
p9011
aVHaken blew my mind within the very first moments of hearing "Premonition" for the first time back in 2011. They definitely have that quality of rapidly growing on people, moreso than any other band I can think of!
p9012
aVThat was basically my experience.  I think I actually had just come across /r/progmetal at the time and discovered them here at work.  Fired up Visions in the car one night while travelling and I basically lost my mind after hearing Premonition and Nocturnal Conspiracy played in order.  I didn't even know what to do.  I called my friend and said "I'll be in the area in about an hour.  We're going on a ride when I get there.  Be ready you gotta hear this". 
p9013
aVYou can say that again! I didn't hear this band until about a week ago. I saw "Restoration" in a related video, clicked on it and immediately, within the first few seconds of listening to this EP, fell in love with this band!
p9014
aVLove Haken! Welcome to the club. When I first discovered Visions I must have listened to it over and over again for a few months. Maybe 40 plays.  Haven't done that with anybody else except maybe Animals as Leaders and their most recent album.  Love that.
p9015
aVI can't wait until Haken releases a new album!!! :D 
p9016
aVGive it a year man. It feels like they've consistently delivered new albums since I think 2010. So that's four so far, i honestly can't wait for the next one, hopefully keeping up with the one a year trend. Their music is so perfect, I found them and April with "The Mountain," and I haven't looked back since. Just waiting for a Tour of America now haha
p9017
aVYeah! Now that would be one hell of a show to see! 
p9018
aVHaken is currently the darling of the prog world, so don't worry we've given them a chance.\u000a\u000aAnd yeah, this EP was 3rd on my albums of the year in 2014. It beat out many full-length albums. Haken is so remarkably consistent.
p9019
aVOut of curiosity, what were numbers 1 and 2? :)
p9020
aVThis is my 2014 top ten :)\u000a\u000a1. Anathema - Distant Satellites\u000a2. Mastodon - Once More 'Round the Sun\u000a3. Haken - Restoration EP\u000a4. Intervals - A Voice Within\u000a5. Devin Townsend - Casualties of Cool\u000a6. Umphrey's McGee - Similar Skin\u000a7. Opeth - Pale Communion\u000a8. IQ - The Road of Bones\u000a9. Animals as Leaders - The Joy of Motion\u000a10. Phish - Fuego\u000a\u000aIt was a weird year...
p9021
aVListening to Distant Satellites right now. Thanks, man!
p9022
aVWhat did you think?
p9023
aVIf you're asking what I thought about Distant Satellites, I liked it but I wouldn't say it's the best album of 2014. Then again, I'm not really sure what I'd say my top 10 of 2014 is. I'll get back to you on that. There's a lot of albums I still need to listen to. Restoration and Pale Communion would definitely be up there, though. 
p9024
aVCool cool. It wasn't a runaway for me, it was a pretty close top 4. It had the advantage of coming out earlier in the year, which probably accounted for how high it placed. You should check out Weather Systems from them as well. That album is a masterpiece
p9025
aVYeah thanks, man. I'll do that. 
p9026
aVAlso, I've listened to "Pale Communion" quite a bit in the past few weeks. I really love that album. It's soooo much better than "Heritage," in my opinion. 
p9027
aVAgreed. Pale Communion has the groovyness that Heritage was seeking but ultimately lacking. It also has more stand-out tracks than Heritage.
p9028
aVYes, my thoughts exactly.
p9029
aVAm I the only one who just really can't seem to like their singer? I've tried so hard. They are stellar musicians but I just don't think Ross is the best fit for these guys. Just my opinion.
p9030
aVOn a technical level he's kinda meh, but I think he fits in with Haken really well. He's got a nice understated style that balances out the crazy instrumental stuff. Plus in a genre with a lot of generic vocalists, he's refreshingly different. Of course it's all opinion, and even I sometimes wish I could hear some crazy soaring vocals in their songs, but I can't really imagine Haken with anyone else.
p9031
aVI agree, I think he has a nice style that fits in with heavier and softer moments very well. I'd love to hear someone like Russell Allen sing in Haken's music with crazy soaring melodies but not everyone can be a Russell Allen and honestly, Haken doesn't really need a Russell Allen.
p9032
aV&gt; On a technical level he's kinda meh, but I think he fits in with Haken really well. He's got a nice understated style that balances out the crazy instrumental stuff. Plus in a genre with a lot of generic vocalists, he's refreshingly different.\u000a\u000aI think this has been said a lot about Dream Theater.  Everyone acknowledges what people have to say about Labrie, but he's just part of the music and if you love DT you love Labrie.  Same goes for Haken I think.  
p9033
aVYou think James LaBrie is technically meh? Have you heard songs like Learning to Live? Because that is far from meh. He's had his issues with lacking vocal power live in the 2000s, but he's hardly understated.
p9034
aVI just think he's a love it or hate it kinda singer for a lot of people.  People tend to say that sort of stuff about him in my experience.  I personally love his work from the early to the recent and have nothing bad to say about him. 
p9035
aVI can't say I enjoy him as much as I just sort of accept him.  He enunciates things strangely or something, and occasionally almost sounds like he has a country-music-singer accent of all things.  But it's not overt enough for it to be a problem I guess.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also his upper-register doesn't have much power behind it.
p9036
aVI had trouble getting into him at first, but I really like him in The Mountain and the new EP. Cockroach King and Because It's There are great. I still think he's not as great in Visions(Insomnia is really good), but still a vocalist that I've come to like more over the last couple years.
p9037
aVI can see why you think that and I respect your opinion, but I have to disagree. I think his vocals are a perfect fit for the music. It's weird, too, because most of the time, when I find a new progressive rock band, I say the same thing - I don't like the vocals, but the music is good. This band is different for some reason.

aVI should rephrase. He's not a bad singer by any means and I do like a lot of their stuff with the vocals. Just a few occasional moments that make me go "meh"
p9039
aVhaha well, I'm not gonna tell you you're wrong for thinking that. Are you talking about a part in this EP or a different album?
p9040
aVMy only issue is his live sound. He doesn't have the range that comes out on the records, so certain passages sound horrible when he tries to sing them live. Whatever though, on the album, Ross is my shit. \u000a\u000aPeople say that about James LaBrie, but he grew on me, and is one of my favorite vocalists.

aVI always show people the part of this song where the music stops and Chino lets out that lone blood-curdling scream from his guttural regions, so needless to say I was very pleased when I was doing things with my lady friend and she orgasmed at that exact moment of the song. And we had started at the beginning of the album. It was beautiful.\u000a

p9080
aVI think you will be able to hear them a lot better, I wonder if the mix is adjusted from the final mix or if the vocal tracks are just removed.\u000a\u000aOn another note: I did notice a big shift in composition from In Time to A Voice Within where the chorus guitar/bass parts are plainer to 'make room' for the vocal part. This is done by design to make sure there isn't too much going on when there *are* vocal tracks. This contrasts the composition of In Time where the lyrical bits are done by the lead guitar. I noticed Tesseract also does this 'making room for the vocalist' a lot as listening to their instrumental album is actually pretty boring in a lot of parts.
p9081
aVThat is what good bands do, make room for the vocals. I bet you they could release it without fixing the mix and it will sound great.  Why? I have a feeling the record was mixed as a instrumental record with vocals on top.  That would explain why it sounded so bad with vocals (the mix, not the album as a whole.)
p9082
aVCould be! I'm not sure if you caught them but a few months ago when they were searching for a new vocalist they dropped 2 instrumental tracks from AVW (just vocals removed, no mix changes) on facebook so people could tryout. Those sounded great, so I'm excited.

p9134
aVDamn, I really got knicker in a knot over that comment didn't I? Sorry to burst your bubble man but chuggy chug meme pop metal isn't prog.
p9135
aVOh hey dude! Didn't want to get in a big discussion over in the other thread since there was a lot of foaming at the mouth going on, but if you're actually interested in discussing it and not just slinging adjectives/blanket statements without fully explaining, I'd enjoy writing a bunch of stuff about Periphery, and hear your thoughts in return. \u000a\u000aI like writing, and don't have a lot of opportunity to do so these days, so I'd be happy to get into this in depth, I'm admittedly not a very succinct person. But wouldn't want to write a big ol' block of words if it wouldn't be productive or interest you? Let me know!
p9136
aVSorry I don't write much and can't articulate well what I want to say but my hate towards Periphery's new album boils down to:\u000a\u000a-Same sterile sounding master as Clear, which was like one extreme to the other coming from the muddy sounding mastering of Periphery 2.\u000a\u000a-Songs are much more formulaic than Periphery 2 and many follow the standard "intro-verse-chrous-verse-chrous-bridge-chrous-outro"\u000a\u000a-Spencer's vocals sound really strained and unnatural compared to P2 (and even Clear) as if he's struggling to hit those sounds. Sounds really forced and not good at all.\u000a\u000a-Related to the last point, the guitar + drum sound is way off and sounds shocking. The drums sound so artificial, like they were programmed in but also the programmer of the drums went out of their way to make them sound plastic or something. Really bad\u000a\u000a-The instrumentation all across the album sounds far more basic and formulaic than Periphery 2. It's like they went from having BTBAM-tier background noise to that of a stock metalcore band like BFMV\u000a\u000a-I don't know much about time signatures and what not but I missed completely any evolving passages like that of Masamune in Periphery 2. Every passage from this album is predictable and stock. Just one of the things that adds to the "formulaic-ness" of this album for me\u000a\u000a-Lyrics are pretty garbage but I don't care all that much for lyrics plus I don't expect a band like Periphery to write decent lyrics so it's something I could overlook\u000a\u000aAll in all it just feels like a sequel to Clear rather than a sequel to Periphery 2. The mastering, guitar + drum sound and Spencer's contrived vocals make the album sound really unnatural.
p9137
aVBut... but... I really liked Clear... :c
p9138
aVI did too, but they should've ended their little pop metal detour there instead of extending it into juggernaut
p9139
aVPeriphery is my favorite band, but I like to pretend that clear never happened. 
p9140
aVWhy? They even labelled it as a side project themselves. Nothing wrong with taking a detour like that, my problem is with them continuing to make Clear style music in Juggernaut.
p9141
aVI like the idea behind clear, but it was just kinda bad IMO. The writing style is similar in juggernaut, but it's kinda like they worked out the kinks to help make a cohesive sound
p9142
aV(1/3) \u000a\u000aThis is great, thanks for checking back in! I actually agree with you on some of your points, I'll try and group things into semi-related chunks and format a lil bit, but apologies in advance for wall of text:\u000a\u000a###Part One - Opinions on Mix/Master/Vocal Technique Are Unrelated to an Assessment of 'Progginess'###\u000a\u000a-I'll get back to that heading in a second, just want to say this is an area where I agree with you on a couple points first. \u000a\u000a-**Vocals** - Only discussing technique and texture, not writing or lyrical content here. I am concerned a little bit about Spencer's vocals, like you mentioned about strain and force. While on one hand, I am absolutely blown away by the variance in vocal texture he can now produce (that was already being alluded to with the comparisons to Rody Walker on P2), it does seem as though he's relying on that mixed raspy cleans when he is up in his higher registers. 22 Faces in particular wears on me after a while, it's a cool effect that reminds me of like a [metal version of Jonny Craig's soulful rasp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0fCXsles90), but when used throughout a whole song like on 22 Faces it loses its emphasis. There's still many wonderful high parts (falsetto in Stranger Things,  Rainbow Gravity, etc.), but it seems, like you said, that some of the higher stuff could be a little forced these days. On P2, highest note was an F# on Ragnarok, and discounting the falsetto on Stranger Things, I think the highest full-voiced note on Juggernaut is a few Es. Not that that's conclusive evidence of loss of range, but perhaps. From the studio videos where Spencer discusses his daily regime of waking up at the crack of noon and then smoking and drinking coffee all day, we'll see how his voice continues to grow and change. Personally, comparing P1 Spencer to now is still an amazing improvement to my ears both studio and live, but I just love hearing all the different sounds and mixed timbres he can get. Same reason I love Rody's.\u000a\u000a*On the other hand*, his diction has improved phenomenally. For the first time, I can tell what he's saying pretty much all the time. P2 was miles better than P1 in that respect, and Juggernaut is equally better than P2. I'd agree that it is pushing towards overly theatrical and over the top, but come on, it's a concept album about cults and murder and literally going to hell and back, it's theatre, it's Dante, it's Wagner, there is no 'over the top'.\u000a\u000a-**Guitar/Drum Sounds** - I'll be honest, this area I pretty much disagree, but to each their own. It's odd that you feel they sound programmed, since this is the first album (I *think*, can't remember if P2 had layered some reinforcement samples on the drums) that the drums are completely live. Kick is huge, snare might have just a bit too much verb (but that's a matter of taste, really, I've always liked it, absolutely love David Maxim Micic's snare for the same reason). P1 being the programmed sterility that is the unfortunate truth of SD2. I think the mix is massive, absolutely adore the low end, like you said it's nothing like the P2 muddy-ish sound, but I love that. It's like all the low end from P2 that I loved over the self-titled, but now it's completely clear as well! You can hear what's going on all the time. Sure, we've moved completely away from any form of grunge-y mud, but they're not trying to be Mastodon or Nirvana. *However*, that's certainly a matter of preference, I can't say "you're wrong" if you don't like a mix, that's why not all music is mixed the same, so no worries.\u000a\u000a-**All of this is largely irrelevant** - Personal tastes and preferences of mix or vocal style (we'll get to discussing actual vocal melodies/harmonies/lyrics in a second) have nothing to do with whether or not an album is super proggy or not. I'll give another example, I personally am not into the more traditional prog quasi-operatic dramatic vocal styles, a la Dream Theater/Symphony X/even Rush or anything. *To me*, it's just too much cheese, generally speaking, and if I'm going to listen to dramatic singing with a lot of vibrato and whatnot, I'll just stick with vocal lieder. THAT BEING SAID, I would never use that as a basis for "oh, Dream Theater's new album is their least prog yet, because I don't like the vocals". I know that's not your whole argument, we'll get to instrumentation and structure soon! But still, just because something's not my bag of chips (Meshuggah), doesn't mean I don't respect it or try to discount it (MESHUGGAH).
p9143
aV(2/3) \u000a\u000a###Part Two - Structure/Instrumentation/Meter/Lyrics/Other Aspects of Music that Have to Do With Being Progressive \u000a\u000aOnce again, I agree with you on some of this.\u000a\u000a-**Instrumentation** - There does seem to be less electronic elements or vocal layering than on P2. Maybe they're trying to have slightly less backing tracks when they're performing live, instead relying on the fact that they have 3 guitars to help set texture/ambience/atmosphere. I'm purely extrapolating, but since there's no guests on the albums, that attitude of "we can do this all ourselves" could be extended into 'guest' additional layers and tracks. I still thought that there was a ton of variance in texture anyway, with everything from acoustics in Priestess to using different ambient parts behind each chorus of Rainbow Gravity, even something like the gradual transition about a minute into The Bad Thing that eventually turns into the basis for the next section seems simple but genius to me.\u000a\u000a-**Lyrics** - Well, the dismissive "lyrics are pretty garbage" being tossed out there is unfortunate, but hey, matter of taste. They're no Fair to Midland, sure, but they're certainly a step up from bland Intervals anti-establishment or The Contortionist SPAAAAACCCEEEE. All my opinion though, it's hard to balance telling a story with keeping the lyrics abstract enough so that they're not cheesy.\u000a\u000a-**Song Structure/Formulaity** - Are there some verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus songs? Oh yeah (22 Faces, Priestess, Graveless. You could probably put MK Ultra and Hell Below in there too). \u000a\u000aBut there's also some songs that start off like that, but then the bridge goes buck wild and next thing you know, it's 2 minutes later and you're *finally* out of the 'bridge', which more turned into a bunch of additional sections then was an actual bridge (Heavy Heart, Rainbow Gravity, Alpha). Ah yes, the Thank You Scientist method of songwriting, start normal, then double the song length with wild bridge expansion.\u000a\u000aThen, obviously, we have the last chunk of even more atypically developed songs. Couple nested songs, with a typical song structure occurring in the middle of another typical song structure, a favorite of [The Mars Volta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pafNgzGRjFk) also was used a bunch on P2. Then we've got The Scourge and Psychosphere, which are fairly asymmetrical, they just move on and progress through the song and have a second half much different from the first half, and then finally Omega and Stranger Things, which I'm assuming you will acknowledge as being fairly crazy structurally.\u000a\u000a*However*, if you go back and look at P2, there\u2019s nothing more special about those song structures. Facepalm mute is verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus, as is The Gods Must Be Crazy!, Froggin\u2019 Bullfish, Scarlet, and MAKE TOTAL DESTROY. Erised and Mile Zero have an extended bridge, while the nested song structure mentioned above occurs in Have a Blast, Ji, and Mile Zero. Ragnarok, Masamune, and Luck as a Constant are asymmetrical, and the second halves are vastly different from the first halves, which I suppose is why The Scourge and Psychosphere remind me of Ragnarok and Masamune. P2 has no longer developed songs to compare to Stranger Things or Omega. I only delve deeply into P2 because it\u2019s what you\u2019ve been comparing Juggernaut to mostly, I\u2019d be happy to break down the self-titled as well, that album would actually fare better, it\u2019s got more structurally complex songs, even if it eventually makes them drag on a bit (Looking at you, Ow My Feelings, you\u2019re about a minute and a half too long, even though you\u2019re in 10/4 time). And obviously Racecar wins, I\u2019m not denying that.\u000a\u000a*Lastly*, I think it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s not absolutely *imperative* to have a ton of wildly complicated structures to be proggy. Sure, it\u2019s ONE of the characteristics that can be an indicator, but it\u2019s not a be-all end-all. The Joy of Motion is fairly simple in terms of song structure, especially compared to AAL\u2019s previous albums, but it\u2019s still firmly in progressive territory. Hell, it\u2019s a freaking manual for extended techniques and their applications in music, plus the songwriting itself is such improved, beautiful melodies and a great flow to the songs. There\u2019s tons of bands in progmetal that don\u2019t engage in super long songs with a billion sections.\u000a\u000a-**Meter/Time Signature** - Juggernaut is wildly impressive to me in terms of meter, and here\u2019s why: they\u2019re smooth sons of bitches about their different meter usage. Periphery is moving away a bit from \u201cpolymeter over 4/4\u201d that djent adores, and is actually embracing odd meters rather than trying to make everything line up in 4/4. Not that that\u2019s completely new, P2 had some cool metrical stuff, Have a Blast in particular has a section (around 1:45) that\u2019s in 9, and the bridge of the inner nested song is in 7. However, Juggernaut goes off the deep end and lands firmly in prog territory. Whether it\u2019s the general configuration, like the fact that the chorus of 22 faces is grouped into 5 measures+3 measures, instead of 4+4, or the fact that Alpha is missing beats left and right, 7/4\u2019s tacked on to the ends of phrases in the verses and the choruses. Or how about more specific constant meter changes? Guitar solo to Rainbow Gravity is structured so crazy [I made a damn chart to keep track of it](https://instagram.com/p/zVI3GFLN0G/?modal=true). You don\u2019t even notice most of the time, which is brilliant writing. Sure, I absolutely adore Protest the Hero and CHON\u2019s school of off-kilter meters that punch you in the head because you don\u2019t know where the next downbeat is going to be, and I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re CHON or DT in their frequency of metre changes, but it compares favorably well to Masamune, which subscribes to the polymeter-over-4/4 school of thought.\u000a\u000a-With regards to general rhythmic playing, there\u2019s a similar amount of chugging on this album as on previous albums, additionally there aren\u2019t any memes or completely irrelevant words in the song titles on this album, so that\u2019s a plus!\u000a\u000a-**Other Progressive Elements** - As [I discuss in length here](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2tf3hv/official_discussion_thread_for_peripherys/cnyx0xw), Periphery uses a ton of recurring themes over the course of the 2 albums, which of course is something that sets the prog alarm ringing. Also, the fact that it\u2019s 80 minutes of music telling a single story is a prog lovers jam, even if you dislike the product or execution. P2\u2019s trilogy was awesome, and this is like that but MORE. As other people have pointed out, there\u2019s both lighter and heavier moments (or at least equally light and heavy) as have occurred on their other albums, resulting in a sonically, harmonically, and melodically diverse group of songs that make up the story. Is it \u201cthe heaviest, most br00tal album ever\u201d? Absolutely not, and the product is certainly not quite what I expected after hearing the band discuss how kvilt it was going to be. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not prog. Of course, we need to address the \u2018poppy\u2019 elephant in the room still.\u000a

aV(3/3)\u000a\u000a###Part Three - In Which \u2018Poppy\u2019 Is Not Actually a Pejorative Term, Despite Some Prog Fans\u2019 Insistence That It Is Exclusively A Negative Quality\u000a\u000a\u000a-Does Spencer write upbeat, catchy melodies over strange riffs? Yes. Is that really such a bad thing? Well, certainly a matter of opinion to some extent, but I think we can safely take away that blanket statement of \u201cPoppy is Bad\u201d. A comparison - Anyone can write a 12-tone song. Arrange all 12 notes in a row, play them in wonky rhythms, and boom! Rob Jarzombek (Note: I have nothing but respect for Mr. Jarzombek, that is mostly a joke I\u2019m making). You know what impresses the hell out of me? The Contortionist writing a 12-tone song that [still sounds melodic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQgL1RuusvE). You think I\u2019m putting a lot of effort into analyzing and writing about Juggernaut? Not even close to as much time as I\u2019ve obsessed over Language the past few months.\u000a\u000aI feel the same way about Spencer. It impresses me that he *can* write catchy melodies over the rest of his bandmates\u2019 strange angular riffage (Mrak\u2019s bouncy fun riffs aside). **I** could write angular melodies over angular riffs, and then no one would remember a single melody I wrote. It\u2019s a whole nother beast to actually come up with an earworm with the instrumental foundation provided.\u000a\u000aI too am not trying to make a blanket statement. Do I enjoy a ton of music that practically punishes the listener until they\u2019ve sat down and really focused and analyzed it a ton to be able to follow what\u2019s going on melodically? Absolutely. Mean\u2019s End\u2019s vocal lines mesmerize me, Fallujah surprised me, Persefone and Uneven Structure hypnotize me. But there\u2019s a lot of the time where I appreciate having an \u2018accessible\u2019 melody, so even a casual listen can be enjoyable, but still have enough complicated stuff going on under the surface to be able to go back and delve into it as much as I want. That\u2019s why Destiny Potato/David Maxim Micic amazes me. Do I see how the \u2018pop\u2019 inflections or highly stylized performance of Spencer would be a turnoff to someone who seeks to avoid anything that sounds even remotely like anything on the radio? Sure, I can even get annoyed myself at some of his theatrics. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a shit writer or singer, just means it\u2019s not your bag of chips. We\u2019re in a genre that\u2019s over the top about so many things, from aggression to visuals to range, I don\u2019t think Spencer is out of place here. I don\u2019t *like* Meshuggah, but I respect the hell out of the writing and performance of it. There\u2019s TONS of bands like that for me, and sure, I\u2019m ready to get pooped on if I say I respect BTBAM a lot more than I like them, but just because I don\u2019t like a new album by an artist I do enjoy doesn\u2019t mean I will dismiss it as \u201ctheir least prog album yet\u201d. \u000a\u000a### Part Four - The Epiloge In Which I Commiserate With You###\u000a\u000aIt *is* certainly unfortunate when a band you love takes a turn that you don\u2019t enjoy as much. I know from your other comments that you do like Periphery, and just are less enamoured of the newest album, so I\u2019m not trying to present a binary situation of \u201coh, you must hate Periphery\u201d, and your situation is a bit different from my feelings about BTBAM or Meshuggah. Probably closer to Closure in Moscow for me, I adored First Temple, but the addition of more bluesy stylings in Pink Lemonade didn\u2019t really impress me. Just that even though the newest album is not your favorite, feels weird to see it written off as their least prog album yet. People are probably bummed now that the whole band is writing stuff, and it interferes with the Misha-focused writing of the previous albums, and I get that, it makes some of the sections a little less cohesive. I mean, it seems *fair* to me to have the whole band involved in writing, but it certainly changes the product. I\u2019m hoping he gets that solo album finished sooner or later, so that the diehard Misha fans can get more of the original Periphery feel that they crave.\u000a\u000aOnce again, thanks for coming back to this, I see that there\u2019s already been an explosion of additional commenting, so I apologize for bringing up this whole situation, but I was in fact interested in getting your side of things more fully.\u000a

aVI don't know how to explain this, but Juggernaut sounds so simple next to P1/2.\u000a\u000aListen to Scarlet and Alpha side by side and tell me there isn't something "basic" about the sounds on Juggernaut?\u000a\u000aI think this comes back to the more basic sounding instrumentation in juggernaut
p9146
aVThe one thing I would agree with you on would be the structure of many of the songs on juggernaut. I end up not caring just due to how catchy they are though. That being said, my favorite songs by far are the ones that don't have the typical structure, most notably hell below and omega. I find it really hard to hate on the quality of those songs regardless of your stance on periphery as a band.\u000a\u000aAnd btw, i would still say juggernaut is their most progressive album so far. They're progressing their sound. They've gone lighter and also heavier than they ever have, and it is all across the span of interconnected lyrics and melodies.
p9147
aVI disagree about being heavier and lighter than ever before, IMO Icarus and Periphery contain far more material at the extremes of that scale.

aVDream Theater - MP2SFAM (Metropolis Part Two : Scenes From A Memory)\u000a\u000aDream Theater are a band of many talents and wonders. Their ambition has always fueled them to go to greater heights, and after the monolithic Awake topped the seminal Images and Words in epic scope and artistic vision, where could they possibly go next? Well, apparently the answer to that in 1997 was Falling into Infinity, which I still haven't heard in its entirety, but what came after that? I guess they didn't like the accusations of commerciality against them on that record, so they went with a complete 180 and released this, the most bloated and sprawling thing anyone had ever heard in metal. There is epic, there is canonical, there is planet-sized and then there is Scenes from a Memory, and all it really does is put me to sleep.\u000a\u000aI mean, how am I supposed to enjoy this? It's like Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime multiplied by three, the most excessive and floridly proggy album the band ever recorded. It's boring. Nothing on here really kicks up much excitement, no matter how many notes they can play per minute or how many drum fills they can put in a four minute song before they stretch it out to eight minutes. There is some sort of conceptual storyline here, but frankly, it doesn't sound very good, and even if it were, it wouldn't save this stinker much. This album is almost impossible to listen to in one sitting, and this is coming from the guy who just sat through Tribuzy's musical torture chamber of fuckery. Dream Theater, I think you deserve some sort of commendment for that.\u000a\u000aSo the album starts off with an introduction piece, with the sound of a clock ticking and a man narrating calmly, telling us to close our eyes, take a deep breath and relax. Preparing us for the grueling chore ahead of us, perhaps? Well, whatever. "Overture 1928" is next, and it's another intro piece. I really don't get why bands would ever do this - one introduction piece is more than enough! To be fair, though, this is the best song on the album, with some rumbling guitar progressions and some nice build-ups. It's really all downhill from here, though, so grab your pillows and your sleeping pills and try not to hit your head on the floor when you go down.\u000a\u000aThere is really not a lot wrong with this that I can't say would also be wrong with the other Dream Theater albums, it's just that this one doesn't seem to have the emotional intensity of some of the later stuff or the exciting grandeur of Images and Words. I'm not the biggest fan of Awake either, as it just left me cold, but this is just ridiculous - it is so elaborate and mechanical that it might as well have been made by a fucking computer in itself. This has a lot of bells and whistles, and the songwriting is certainly complex, but it's too hollow, skimping out on the more personal feel that the Dream Theater songs I like have. I think another thing wrong with this is the way all of the songs are sort of seamlessly connected - this makes them feel much longer than they should, as they don't seem to have any veritable starting or ending points. It is easy to see the intention here, but it doesn't work.\u000a\u000aOh, and "Finally Free" is probably the worst Dream Theater song ever. Completely enervated, painful crap with some truly awful, awful vocals. Good god, this sucks.\u000a\u000aThis album fails to incite any emotional response, and so despite whatever nonsensical reasons people have for liking this, it's not worth picking up. Avoid. \u000a\u000a[[from metal-archives.com](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Dream_Theater/Metropolis_Pt._2%3A_Scenes_from_a_Memory/1374/Empyreal/88990)]

aVHaken - Aquarius\u000a\u000aSometimes I think Prog bands have become too heavy and percussive in imitation of Nevermore, and then something like this abomination comes across my desk. Hakon are a UK-based Prog band, and I hesitate to even call this metal at all. I only review this because it will get promoted as metal, and so somebody needs to point out that this is in fact supremely dandified prog diddling in the vein of bands like Yes or old Genesis \u2013 except to say that would be to do a supreme disservice to Peter Gabriel and Rick Wakeman. So let's be clear: this makes The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway sound like Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk in comparison. This is so pussified that I cannot call it that without insulting every woman ever born. This is filled with pop hooks, acoustic strumming, and pop synth faux-orchestrations so candified they are embarrassing. You, the listener, will be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed just acknowledging that this album even exists. An album that is a pus-seeping offense to art.

aVDeath - The Sound of Perseverance\u000a\u000aHere you have it - Death's last (and worst) album. Evil Chuck finally got rid of the little mask thing on top of the H on the logo, and in time, he would have probably gotten rid of the scythe as well if it managed to give him some bits of the artistic credibility he oh so craved. The amount of songwriting not present here is staggering; it's actually amazing they managed to record, produce, mix, master and release an entire album without writing any songs at all. Random changes in pace that have nothing to do with what was happening before, a now complete, total and absolute lack of good riffs, Evil Chuck doing a Dani Filth impersonation all the way through, and some of the worst shredding you'll ever have the misfortune to hear in your life are merely elements of the terribleness present in this album. At this point Death don't have a single trace of death metal in them anymore, so this is pretty much a full-blown extreme progressive metal album. Sounds bad? You haven't even begun to listen to The Sound of Perseverance.\u000a\u000aPerformance-wise, it's the usual Death. Basically, (mostly) everyone gives off a nice performance on their own, which turns into a wreck once everything is added together. The drumming, for one, is such a poor show of groove and restraint that it sadly manages to subtract more from the songs than actually add to them. There's no Hoglan here anymore, so what we get instead is some guy accentuating every nanosecond with every single cymbal on his kit, which I guess is technically impressive, but doesn't do anything to improve the songs. I feels like a drummer trying to play the jazziest beats ever because he would get bored otherwise, but in the end, they feel completely disconnected from the rest of the instruments. In short, it's bad progressive metal drumming. Instead of giving a feel of connection between the rhythmic and melodic elements, the drummer opts to rather show off how many cymbals can be played in the shortest possible time-span. I'm not completely sure if it's Richard Christy's fault for his lack of taste, or if Schuldiner asked him to be as loose as possible in his delivery. The only thing I've heard featuring him is that Control Denied album, but then again it also featured Chuck's songwriting; I'll throw a wild guess and simply blame them both for the mess present here.\u000a\u000aSteve DiGiorgio left/was fired before this album was recorded, so he's not present here either. Not that he's missed, since he was mostly relegated to follow the guitars around on the preceding albums. Seriously, you would have expected Chuck to use such a good bass player in a more respectful way. Here, the bass takes on a more active role. It also has a very nice, warm sound. You can hear it thumping under the guitars at times, and it really shines on the quieter parts. However, those parts usually suck more than anything. Those middle sections of "Flesh and the Power it Holds" and "Scavenger of Human Sorrow" are complete snooze fests, and not only do they both manage to appear and go away randomly and out of thin air, masquerading their go as progression, but they contain the most extensive use of bass in the entire album just to be drowned out by Chuck's shitty, shitty soloing. What was he playing those with, a coin?\u000a\u000aAnd that brings us to the guitars themselves. I'm not even going to try to make a case for the riffs, as they are a non-entity. However, if you want to know how they sound like, just picture a bunch of bland thrash/melodeath riffs with lots of sugar thrown in them, and some chugging thrown in for good measure. Let's focus on the shredding instead. It is easily and by far the worst soloing on any Death album, and it isn't even because of a lack of melodic skill, but because of a lack of pure restraint. Case in point, "Voice of the Soul" is an actually amazing track. It's the best later-era Death song ever because it isn't Chuck and company betting to see who plays the fastest, most pompous solo (and in his case, he always lost because he was sloppy as if he were playing with a piece of cardboard). That song works because it carries a principle of "just write a damn song and don't get too cute with it". Also, it doesn't feature vocals, but more on that later. I don't know of Shannon Hamm's work beyond what he did on Control Denied, but that album is probably not the best way to judge any musician present in it. He plays some actually decent leads every so and so while Chuck botches his and succeeds in giving his sloppiest guitar performance ever, and with a career like his, that's saying a lot.\u000a\u000aThe biggest problem, performance-wise, with The Sound of Perseverance is the vocals. Chuck's silly growls have always been Death's weakest point, but here he just plain out stopped giving a damn. As said earlier, it sounds like he was trying to do a Dani Filth impersonation, with a very annoying high pitched growl that sounds as threatening as, well, Dani Filth. It's a huge step down, because whereas the vocals on other Death albums are uneventful at best and just flat out boring at worst, these are downright obnoxious to listen to. Chuck maintains his "do everything with exactly the same-sounding screech" approach that he has always used, but this time said screech just feels like ear rape. At some points, he'll actually do this weird clean-sounding rasp, but that ends up sounding more like bad melodeath vocals than anything. At least he learned his lesson and actually hired a singer for his Control Denied album -- which is the obvious thing anyone would've done when wanting to write a pure progressive metal album. Also, his "sss" hisses sound horrible. "Dreamssss ssssiiight eyeesss sss sssss sssnaakeesss" goddammit Chuck you were not a reptile, you were a human being, you didn't even have scales.\u000a\u000aThis is all, of course, completely irrelevant once you point out the actual flaw in the album, which is the songwriting. It's obviously bad, since we know who was in charge of it, but whereas other Death albums showed elements of good songwriting deeply hidden down a sea of shit/nonexistent songwriting, The Sound of Perseverance's approach to this delicate, vital and essential part of making music is to pretty much not do it at all. You know how death metal is supposed to have a sense of chaos? Of dark, morbid riffs that hit you in the head without mercy, but that at the same time manage to find an order within? This tries to do the opposite of that. Instead of ending up with a bunch of songs whose inherent chaos gives you no chance to escape, there are a bunch of verses, choruses, solos, silly fusion sections and a myriad of other things just thrown into a blender and arbitrarily arranged. You could cut them up, paste them into other songs, trade them around, delete them, and nobody would notice the difference. There are awkward silences between sections, proving that their transitions weren't thought of at all, so a section will end abruptly to mark the start of another section that has nothing to do with either the one before, or the one after it. It doesn't sound chaotic, it simply sounds random; like a kid just writing his first song and tabbing it out in guitar pro.\u000a\u000aThere is one instance of good songwriting here, and that would be "Painkiller" (har har). Obviously, Evil Chuck completely mangled and butchered it and turned it into what I still believe is the worst cover ever. Those videos on YouTube of high school bands full of kids covering "The Final Countdown" and "Sweet Child O'Mine" provide a better listening experience, and in general are more faithful to the spirit of the song. Chuck sounds like an impersonation of Dani Filth doing a Rob Halford imitation. This is made worse by the fact the vocals are laughably louder than the guitars, which do useless harmonizations of the original riffs which didn't need to be harmonized in the first place. Then Chuck comes in with the main solo to completely ruin the original, doing some very sloppy sweep picking exercises in the beginning, and then turning it into a melodeath section that makes no sense at all within the context of the song. "Thisss isss daah Painkillaahh" No, Chuck, you're causing me pain, not killing it. Please stop it, it's mean. You are not Rob Halford. You are not Glenn Tipton. You're not even Ian Hill. Why do you do this.\u000a\u000aSummarizing, The Sound of Perseverance is a horrible album. It's shit, and you're better off listening to "Voice of the Soul" on YouTube or something. Death fell so hard into the concrete below they managed to crack it, keep falling, and then continue all the way into earth's mantle -- all while sustaining horrible internal injuries. It's prog for the sake of being prog, it has terrible vocals, terrible shredding, terrible riffs, and I still have no idea what the cover art is supposed to be, but it's really ugly. Gladly, as far as I know, not many bands have gone ahead and started playing in this style consistently, so at least it stands on its own haven of awfulness. It is to be avoided.\u000a[Metal-archives](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Death/The_Sound_of_Perseverance/618/RageW/167602)

aVWhat the f--- is this. Seriously What the F--- is this.\u000a\u000aKayo Dot - Choirs of the Eye.\u000a\u000aI was expecting something quite mind boggling from ex-Maudlin of the Well members, however what we have here is probably the non-metalheads of the group homogenizing the music ... either that or they just came to the realisation that metal isnt cool anymore, or with age theyve grown bored of it.\u000a\u000aIf I had to describe this I would say "Post-rock noise with accompanying jazz/fusion guitar and the same sort of drumming used on the lighter/slower tracks on MOTW - Bath/LYBM and a random assortment of other instruments"\u000a\u000aNow by that description it does actually sound good, but I think that these guys have gone past my point of appreciation, dropped 99% of the metal influences they had and said hey, hardcore and emo are popular now, lets throw in some random grindcore and emo twists in our songs to hook the suckers in.\u000a\u000aSo half way into the song you'll have a 20 second long piece of grindcore and then it will go straight back to the random experimental noise/post-rock and then at the end of the song the lead vocalist will start whining like an angsty emo kid about some random gibber that on the first listen was unintelligable.\u000a\u000aThere are some good things about the music, I like the drumming even though it doesnt really do anything, its full on jazz drumming through every song while most of the musicians just pure improv for the whole song, the guitar work is quite skilled, in fact pretty much everything here is of good quality but it was like a child that has never done a jigsaw puzzle before wrote these songs.\u000a\u000aI apologise that I am not of these "muso" scenester kids with an art degree that plays jazz/guitar and listens to post-rock, noise and avantegarde music 100% of the time that thinks melody, structure and actual purposes for songs other than to improvise for 10 minutes while accompanied by a mass of other musicians just to make noises that create a fascade of atmosphere to overshadow the fact that this is a pointless song with nothing but filler and build-ups that lead absolutely nowhere.\u000a\u000aThis music is uninspired, it seems that the musicians in this band think they have done everything and outgrown their old style, and that the only way to retain "professional musicianship" is to create music that is abstract without coherence, with pointless buildups that lead nowhere to mislead the listener into thinking they've missed something. The bits and pieces of grindcore and emo are simply there to represent the uninspiration or passion for music that the band members seem to have lost and to hook in the scenester kids.\u000a\u000aHowever there is no doubting that the musicians in this band are very skilled at what they do, and perhaps if all of the pieces written for this album were rearranged into something comprehensable that leads somewhere, with inspiration and purpose this album would have been alot better.\u000a\u000aMaudlin of the Well - Bath and Leaving Your Body Map are probably my two favourite albums of all time, however it is clear to me that the intellectuals who composed those brilliant pieces of work have been led astray.\u000a\u000aSumming up I give this album a mere score of 20 points for the skill of the musicians and the fact that some of the music is quite good - such as the guitarwork and drumming. Everything else just didnt quite work, and thus I am disappointed. I dont think this band should actually be on Metal archives as they are clearly not metal.\u000a\u000aI'm sorry if I am not 'avant', 'indie', 'arty', 'original' or 'open-minded' enough to full understand this album of pure random ... I think it's just way over the top, good concept but bad demonstration.\u000a\u000a(from [metal-archives](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Kayo_Dot/Choirs_of_the_Eye/32593/Enverxis/49895))

aVMetallum user review of Mastodon's Crack the Skye\u000a\u000a**Fuckers - 12%**\u000a\u000aThis is it? This is the Mastodon album everyone is tossing as the new masterpiece, this revolutionary modern classic? This is what everyone is excited about? Holy fuck, this sucks. Fuck, I can barely even listen to this tripe. How is everyone else so enamored with it? I honestly rarely hate albums as much as I do this one, because I actually went out of my way to praise Mastodon\u2019s last album Blood Mountain, which I still think is pretty good. But for them to put out this\u2026it\u2019s nothing less than completely inexcusable.\u000a\u000aThis is Crack the Skye, and it sucks so hard that I am inclined to believe it was made by a completely different band and accidentally released under the Mastodon name. I bet the record executives just forgot to check the tape; that must be it. This was a project by some no-name group of mountain-men from the Rockies; probably incestuous child-rapists without any kind of formal musical training. Heinous devil-men with blunt head trauma from falling down rocks and genitals swollen from having to pull out cactus spikes too often.\u000a\u000aBut alas. I cannot rest in realms of fantasy forever. Mastodon made this album, and it is my duty to verbally castrate them for it. Let the festivities begin:\u000a\u000aAlternative rock choruses, obnoxiously bland guitarwork and unnaturally nasal vocals, oh my! Mastodon have conjured up something here that is so far away from metal that it\u2019s hard to believe so many people are fooled into thinking this is some kind of a progression. Frankly, anyone who thinks this is any kind of a metal masterpiece or a progressive one is high. I do not want any of what these people are smoking, nor do I ever want to meet any of them in person.\u000a\u000aThe album kicks off with a song that nobody will ever remember after its end, one that is perhaps the most unmemorable song I have ever heard in my entire life. It is titled \u201cOblivion,\u201d and I have to wonder here, how is it possible to make this kind of progressive rock so god-awfully painful? It\u2019s some of the most wretchedly unpleasant music ever. The rumbling guitars and whiddly leads should be inoffensive, but they\u2019re played in such a condescending, self-conscious manner that they become\u2026vile, uneasy and despicable. The vocals don\u2019t help. They\u2019re whiny and obnoxious, and it\u2019s probably the worst clean vocal performance I\u2019ve ever heard in my life from a major band like this. Good god, he makes Ozzy sound like Dio! It\u2019s absolutely atrocious. Everything he sings is specifically tailored to be as painful as possible. Listen to that chorus on \u201cDivinations\u201d \u2013 have you ever in your life heard something that disgustingly snobbish? It is sung with this horrible self-righteousness, this terrible \u201cironic\u201d sort of arrogance; you can hear it in that sleazy sheen to his whiny rambling. It\u2019s like they\u2019re talking down to the listener for buying their album, for falling for it!\u000a\u000a\u201cQuintessence\u201d has a chorus that goes \u201cLet it go, let it go!\u201d Fitting, in the sense that the song is pretty much a six-minute extraction of the band\u2019s collective bowels. Completely disgusting. \u201cThe Czar\u201d is like Black Sabbath or Pink Floyd played by morons who don\u2019t understand the first thing about atmosphere and flow, and \u201cGhost of Karelia\u201d incorporates Thrash riffing as bland and out of place as it can possibly be. The title track is stupidly heavy, sounding the most like the Mastodon I know and love, but also not being anywhere near as compelling or interesting. \u201cThe Last Baron\u201d finishes with a whopping thirteen minutes of ridiculously boring, tepid droning and psychedelic vomit that would make Jimi Hendrix cry. It\u2019s a dreadful song without any kind of entertainment value. Dragging, overwrought and annoying, this is a surefire way to show people how NOT to end a music album.\u000a\u000aThis is just bad all around; there\u2019s nothing good about it. Sure, a few of the leads are pretty good, but they\u2019re not very memorable, and they don\u2019t rise above the sea of splooge that are the songs they\u2019re submerged in. I just don\u2019t get the entire idea behind this. The progressions are aimless; they do not seem to have any direction at all. The songs are ear-bleeding awful, being unbelievably pretentious in their delivery and also doubly not sounding any good. The music is just unpleasant all around, sounding dishonest, mean-spirited and just all around puerile, in both instrumentation and feel.\u000a\u000aFrankly, I\u2019ve figured out why everyone thinks this is so revolutionary. It\u2019s very clear to me now. Obviously those people who praised it for that reason were praising it because there was never before anything so universally fucking annoying! That must be it! Truly, Crack the Skye is a masterclass in horrendous songwriting and aimless attempts at progression. I\u2019ve never heard anything so wretched in tone and irritating in mood, so unbelievably boring and excruciating. It\u2019s as if it was a dream \u2013 nothing in reality could be so senselessly offensive to my common morality!\u000a\u000a\u2026yeah, Mastodon suck now. Too bad, I guess.\u000a\u000a[Source](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Mastodon/Crack_the_Skye/224685/)\u000a\u000aMy favorite part of the review is when he says, "The vocals don\u2019t help. They\u2019re whiny and obnoxious, and it\u2019s probably the worst clean vocal performance I\u2019ve ever heard in my life from a major band like this. Good god, he makes Ozzy sound like Dio! It\u2019s absolutely atrocious."

aVI don't get anybody who likes Blood Mountain over Crack the Skye. (Actually, I didn't come around to Crack the Skye for a while...)
p9165
aVBM is my favourite Mastodon album, whereas CTS is my least favourite. I dislike CTS for pretty much every reason the above reviewer stated, they went for a more straightforward bland rock approach, and I can barely remember any of the songs(except for The Last Baron, which is a great song), the whole album is just a mash of forgettable melodic choruses, and bland riffs with arpeggios loudly played over them, at least that's how I see it. BM however has far more drive to it, and the really catchy heavy riffs they're known for, as well as some very creative melodies that stand out because they're used sparingly, rather than overpowering every riff. I went off on a bit of a tangent there, but hopefully that clears up why (a small minority of Mastodon fans) like BM more than CTS.
p9166
aVBlood Mountain is also my favorite album, but I still like CTS a lot. I understand the criticism of it though.

aVNot text but a video.\u000a\u000a[The Needle Drops Parallax 2 Review] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JtSBVS1GkA)\u000a\u000aI personally enjoy the majority of Anthonys album reviews. But i disagree completely with his on Future Sequence.
p9169
aVDid he listen to Colors? Because the some of the parts he complained about, he described in a way that could be applied to Colors.

aVYeah he was just *wrong* about that album.\u000a\u000aEDIT: and I agree with most of his reviews as well
p9172
aVI feel like posting anything from Metal Archives is just low-hanging fruit.  There's always someone giving a classic album a 2% on there...
p9173
aVYeah true, that reminds me I was going to suggest looking on Amazon for lulzy reviews as well. \u000a\u000aI like the metal archives sometimes but ever since I read the thread about why "djent" bands aren't allowed on the site it left a bad taste in my mouth. Claiming bands like TesseracT, The Contortionist, Monuments, Periphery etc aren't metal. The worst line was a mod saying something like "well even contemporary Meshuggah isn't metal..."
p9174
aVThey do great work, but they're elitist assholes. I mean, they refuse to categorize Between the Buried and Me as metal and therefore they're not on the site. It's pretty arbitrary. They try to say they have a strict way to gauge it, but that's just blatantly not true. 
p9175
aVI got in an argument with someone about whether or not AAL was metal, and he linked me to metal archives to show they're not on there. Then he posted a pic of the band in some preppy clothes (which was actually a decent promo pic) and made a comment to the extent of "oooh they look so metal!". However, I pointed out they are actually a black metal band because there's a black guy in it and he conceded to me.

aVOpeth - Still Life  \u000a&gt;**Dear lord, when will it end? - 6%**   \u000a&gt;**by UltraBoris**  \u000a&gt;  \u000a&gt;Well, this is Yet Another Blopeth Album. What the world sees in this band is completely beyond me: their song constructions are incoherent, their guitar work forgettable, their vocals either misplaced death growls or horrible whining. There is no emotion to be found here - no stirring odes to battle, no banging one's head as if up from the dead, no connection to be made with the listener. It's just... there. It is perfect background music - harmless and unaffecting.\u000a\u000a&gt;So we start with "The Moor", which does just about absolutely nothing for about 1 minute and 45 seconds, before finally launching into some (relatively) heavy-as-a-motherfuck ... acoustic guitar! Actually, this isn't all that bad, and this would have served as a great intro, especially into the electric part that starts around 2.30. Holy crap, this is, while being about twice as long as it should be, is a solid buildup - add another layer at around 2.40, and some solid riffs... this actually isn't bad. Then we get some death growls - so are we trying to be brutal or atmospheric here? The dichotomy is terrifying. Then, some decent riffage at around 4:15 in, but something seems missing - maybe it's a bit of destruction, or a bit of rockage value - somehow this band seems too mellow and out of it for its own good. Even when they are trying to be heavy-as-hell death metal, they sound like they have been knocked into a coma. Throw in a little break at the six minute mark, then more death-metal stuff, before going into a little interlude later in the song. Nothiing happens for about two minutes, until for no reason the heavy part comes back. What a schizophrenic little song! It's nearly 12 minutes long too - somewhere in there is a decent 4 minute intro piece. The vocal passages sound forced and weak, and the interludes are too silly.\u000a\u000a&gt;That right there sums up all there is to know about Opeth - too many dumb musical ideas. The riffage is just not powerful, sounding like bad Arch Enemy riffs, being played by a guitarist who has been shot in the ass by a tranquiliser dart. "Godhead's Lament" is more of the same stuff - including the obligatory clean vocals and acoustic guitar passage in the middle. Even when it is kinda heavy, the album is slow and plodding and boring. Black Sabbath, this is not. Also, the clean vocals seem to lack passion and delivery. The verse around 8:50 in is just so going-through-the-motions.\u000a\u000a&gt;Benighted is a total riff monster. Well, it's not, but I felt that I should delude myself slightly in order to maintain some semblance of sanity, as this passage is totally and completely boring. It's a little acoustic piece, and it provides no rousing sense of importance. No overwhelming emotional value like a "Waiting for a Savior" or "Man of Sorrows" - this one just wants to drug you into a coma.\u000a\u000a&gt;"Moonlapse Vertigo" brings back the electric guitar, but again it's the clean vocals that dominate, with a lot of random acoustic passages too. Typical Opeth. No real riffs to be found here, just some meandering soloing... oh yes, there's the death vocals later in the song too, but make no mistake, there is nothing "death metal" about this band. Even the metalness is questionable at times - somewhere I could've sworn that metal was not about boring acoustic passages.\u000a\u000a&gt;"Face of Melinda" starts off with a silly passage dominated by the drums - of course, the guitars are so powerful that they could be dominated by a feather, but that is irrelevant. This sounds like bad lounge music - something I'd expect to hear at the dentist's office, or in the elevator. About 4 minutes in, the song crashes into recognition, and finally shows some signs of life. However, not too many - it is still boring as fuck, unfortunately. There is no definition to the songs on the guitar-composition level. No solid heavy metal riffs, in other words.\u000a\u000a&gt;"Serenity Painted Death" blazes forward at breakneck speed... well, for these guys anyway. I hope they didn't break too many bones playing at over 110 beats per minute. Again, it's not the slowness that bothers me (see: Saint Vitus for slow music done right), but the lack of inspiring me to act in any way. It leaves me flat out bored. It is unclear what they are attempting to accomplish here - the passages lack atmosphere, the solos lack clarity, and the guitar work lacks memorableness. There is no catchy riff that I can point out - no Kreator "People of the Lie" immediate headbanging frenzy, or an Iron Maiden "Seventh Son" six minute solo that is remembered note for note when it ends. Nothing. Just misplaced death vocals. Only at the end does the song pick up finally - around the 7:40 mark. That part is a bit discernable, but when the random faceless acoustic passage kicks in, you know they're done with that idea.\u000a\u000a&gt;Finally, White Cluster. Death vocals in this one, over guitars that, again, lack any sort of force to them. The passage at around 0:41 is repeated several times, and none of those times does it appeal to me. Then that is lost, and the clean vocalist comes back to yell a few times - his voice is very horrible, very bleating. I just imagine a sheep being speared. The song nearly falls silent at around 5:10 - yes, kids, this is the modern heavy metal here. Useless acoustic passages ist krieg!!! The rest of the song does nothing of concern.\u000a\u000a&gt;And I have managed to suffer through yet another album. It's mildly better than Blackwater Park, but still quite terrible. So many BAD ideas thrown into this one - not a single memorable riff. All hail the new metal!

aVThis one actually made me rage:\u000a\u000a "This Is Spinal Tap - 20%\u000aFullMetalAttorney, August 3rd, 2011\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDevin Townsend's pedigree is unimpeachable. He's a brilliant songwriter and incredibly talented guitarist and vocalist. Some people drool at the very mention of his name, and would lick his boots no matter what he does. Much was made of the recording process, which involved symphonic elements and choirs and was simply a huge undertaking. So, the final heavy album of the Devin Townsend Project was one of the most highly-anticipated albums of the year. Could it possibly live up to the anticipation?\u000a\u000aPut simply, no. It's a bloated, 71 minute mess, the kind of thing mockumentaries are made of. Opener "Praise the Lowered" starts out with some very quiet Phil Collins kind of stuff, then gets a little heavy. It's a six minute intro. The follow-up, "Stand", is nine minutes of build-up. Tension, but no release. In other words, this ridiculous opera starts out with over 17 minutes of intro.\u000a\u000aThe other extended compositions--the 11 minute "Planet of the Apes", 16 minute "The Mighty Masturbator", and 9 minute title track--are perfect illustrations of meandering prog excess. Random, disparate parts are strung together in endless array, few of which are heavy, memorable, or even interesting. They're punctuated by choirs, symphonies, synths, and I'm fairly certain I heard the kitchen sink in there as well. There are short parts in there that are quite good, and they remind you of what Hevy Devy can do, but they are rare and all too short.\u000a\u000aEven the shorter cuts seem pointless. The 6 minute "Sumeria", for example, is a selection of random garbage played over the top of a so-so riff.\u000a\u000aThe only consistently redeeming feature of the album is Devin's own vocals. He uses his full range of growls, clean singing, and narration. The lyrics are injected with his quirky sense of humor, frivolity belying his deeper meanings. But lyrics don't matter much to me, and vocals alone don't save this otherwise laughable record.\u000a\u000aThe Verdict: This is Spinal Tap. If they had made a movie about the production of this thing, it would have been hilarious. Perhaps it is the work of an out-of-touch genius with a bloated ego and ideas bigger than he can pull off. On the other hand, given his well-known sense of humor, maybe Deconstruction is just a joke on all of us, to see if we'll just swallow any pill he prescribes."
p9180
aVHe actually rated the album 3.5/5 but it's a shitting of a review\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve noticed something I do when I\u2019m listening to Periphery. It\u2019s probably not something many of their other fans do, but from my impressions, Periphery\u2019s fanbase aren\u2019t the most intelligent or interesting bunch. When I listen to a Periphery song, especially from this album, I subconsciously filter the instrumentation, and focus entirely on Spencer\u2019s vocal parts. It\u2019s strange, because many, many people do the opposite, and so often Periphery have been asked to provide instrumental versions. But I just can\u2019t afford to have this barrage of murderous noise affect my enjoyment of the great melodies that Spencer manages to come up with.\u000a\u000aLets be honest, Periphery have some of the worst and messiest instrumentals I have ever heard. It\u2019s not just the farty \u2018djent\u2019 tone that they seem to still have an obsession with, it\u2019s also the masses and masses of parts that don\u2019t seem to blend with each other, it\u2019s the strange need they have for putting riffs everywhere, where maybe there should be chords or textures, but they just chug everywhere and everywhen. There\u2019s no doubt that these guys are incredibly talented. Some of them, I even have some respect for. Matt Halpern is undeniably an incredibly versatile drummer, he can play nearly every style of metal drumming with flair and technicality (although his kit tone is pretty terrible), and I also have respect for him as an entrepreneur and businessperson, with his music lesson business and drum clinics (although I wish they weren\u2019t so expensive), and then there\u2019s Nolly, their new British bassist, who is one of my favourite producers ever. He has produced some of my favourite underground rock records, like Natural Tendency and The Holographic Principle, but I just wish I could find some respect for him as a bassist.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m generally not a fan of this kind of music, as my opinions on Animals as Leaders and the like should prove, and it\u2019s why I hate it being called \u2018progressive metal\u2019, because I never know if an album is the great progressive metal that I love, or this messy and unoriginal style of making me cringe. Yet, above all that, I still enjoy Periphery\u2019s music, and as I mentioned before, it\u2019s almost entirely down to their vocalist, Spencer Sotelo. Sure, they have a good riff every now and then, like the lead riff of \u201cScarlet\u201d, or some of the stuff during \u201cJi\u201d or \u201cLuck As A Constant\u201d, but it\u2019s covered with that vomit tone and so much damn compression that I struggle to hear it. And even their atmospheres are bad, the pseudo-electronic tones they put in are just so dried up. But, I still enjoy them.\u000a\u000aWhen you listen to the vocal parts over the instrumentals, you really have to gain some respect for what Spencer has to do. Listen to any of the parts, and imagine putting a vocal part over that. There are no chords, no melodies, not even many rhythms to base your part on, yet Spencer does it so flawlessly. And he does it, basically, by ignoring everything and just flying over the top. It doesn\u2019t mix with the music well at all, and maybe that\u2019s why so many people hate him, but at least his parts are good, unlike those guitar parts\u2026\u000a\u000aBut seriously, pull the vocals from this album and I\u2019d be struggling to give it a score above 3.5/10. The riffs are sloppy and without defined rhythm or key, and the solos are beyond awful. Shit, some of these solos are from skilled players, but they all sound so forced and out of place, like the band has gone \u201cright, solo here and here and here\u201d and then played some random string of notes. Take the track \u201cErised\u201d, which is one of the quieter ones (therefore the best), but both solos here just sound so unnatural and forced, especially the first one, coming straight out of a rather nice verse. The solos don\u2019t hold a melody or idea for their duration, they just play seemingly random notes in a random order. As much as I hate to praise someone likeJohn Petrucci, at least his solo starts out well. Those first two or three arpeggios fit perfectly in with the music (although I\u2019m not sure any of the last two minutes of \u201cErised\u201d are necessary at all), but of course, being Petrucci, it dissolves into mindless wank within a few seconds.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s thoroughly impressive how Spencer and his incredible knack for an excellent hook keeps this album afloat so long. I\u2019ll be listening to a track, thinking \u201cman, this one\u2019s pretty bad, I\u2019ll probably skip this next time\u201d, but partway through, Spencer just hits a groove and sings something so absolutely scrumptious that I have to go back and replay it. Take a song like \u201cHave A Blast\u201d. The violin part at the intro is alright, but it quickly dissolves into some pretty hefty wank-core, and aside from a couple of nifty parts from Halpern (his sudden blast beat part is great), it\u2019s a pretty dismal track. But then\u2026\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2026and it\u2019s the thrill of life that enables us to grow. Locked in the spirit\u2019s line, souls entwine to journey on as one.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd then suddenly it\u2019s incredible. I\u2019ve regularly used \u201cHave A Blast\u201d as an example of a track that goes from absolute trash to beauty within seconds. And it\u2019s not just the vocal line, during that segment I actually think the guitars finally fit with the vocals and the tone, creating a beautiful segment with a spine-chillingly good vocal melody.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s not a single moment. The number of times this happens during This Time It\u2019s Personal is ridiculous, nearly every song has some moment that redeems it from mediocrity, all of them from Spencer. The only real tracks that fail to have any moments I enjoy would be \u201cMake Total Destroy\u201d and the last four tracks, which I will usually pass on when giving this album a spin. I can honestly say that the only tracks I enjoy right the way through would be \u201cMuramasa\u201d, \u201cScarlet\u201d and \u201cErised\u201d, when Spencer is given enough front time to make a difference for the whole track. The melody from \u201cMuramasa\u201d is absolutely brilliant, and the thing that made me look into this album when the trailer was released (I didn\u2019t expect much after the debut), but both the times it is reprised, in \u201cRagnarok\u201d and \u201cMasamune\u201d, it feels weak and forced, and doesn\u2019t even save those tracks from mediocrity.\u000a\u000a\u201cFacepalm Mute\u201d would probably be the worst track here, messier and more metalcore than everything else, but then the chorus hits, and\u201cNEGLECT A SENSE OF IGNORANCE TO ALLTEEEER LIEEEEEESS\u201d and suddenly it\u2019s fantastic. The hooks on this album are possibly the best I\u2019ve heard in years.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are the dark, that feed upon the living in sooolid shadoooooawwwww\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2026if you love the guilt then let it die, a life left so clean. We\u2019ll measure the price of misery\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s noooot for meee to saywhatyouneedtobelieeeeve\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSCARRRLEEEEEEEAAAAAAAATTTT\u201d\u000a\u000aThis Time It\u2019s Personal is a record I love for basically the opposite of the reasons its fans love it, and I know that full well. I can see what the haters are saying, this is pretty bad, but I just can\u2019t say no to those hooks.
p9181
aV&gt; And he does it, basically, by ignoring everything and just flying over the top\u000a\u000aYeah, I'm sure if you asked him he would agree that is his approach...\u000a\u000a&gt; The riffs are sloppy and without defined rhythm or key, \u000a\u000aWhat does that even mean? I love when the reviews are so egotistic and bloated with word vomit and then you understand that the person does not play any instruments and does not know a thing about how to write or play music.
p9182
aVI agree that the instruments sound real muddy at times. Plus the way that record is mastered makes it sound super muddy. It's not a well mastered record at all which is a shame
p9183
aVHaha, I know exactly the guy and review you're talking about. He is strangely generous with his reviews, especially since he keeps reviewing things he clearly is too good for. I have a feeling he just writes inflammatory crap to draw in viewers to his blog/Facebook page, but doesn't want to rate things too low or else he'll piss too many people off.\u000a\u000aEven weirder is I find him hitting some points I agree with, but I like the album more than he clearly does yet I still rated the same as him.
p9184
aVI've been following the guy for a while and I agree with him most of the time but I just don't quite agree with his opinion on periphery 2
p9185
aVI looked high and low trying to find a review that bashed Karnivool's *Sound Awake* but as it turns out, that album is pretty universally loved (and for great reason). I opted instead to find a review described as "ambivalent" for my third-favorite album: *Frames* by Oceansize.\u000a\u000a&gt; Though still relatively unknown to the music world, this Manchester 5-piece have managed to build a loyal &amp; fanatical following. Now onto their third album with Frames, the band will be hoping to win even more admirers. \u000a\u000a&gt; Oceansize's sound consists of multi-layered arrangements which borrow elements of post-rock and heavy metal to create a sense of epic brutality. Unfortunately though, Oceansize lose points vocally. Though you might be thankful to find that lead singer Mike Vennart doesn't show any glimpses of a half-baked Liam Gallagher, the wannabe American rock/emo-pop vocals the band cling onto are just as bad, if not worse. \u000a\u000a&gt; Even though Oceansize's Frames will appeal to many, it's also certain to dissatisfy many hardened followers of the post-rock &amp; heavy metal genres. Overall; I would be lying if I said that this record is anything other than a little disappointing.\u000a\u000aI have to mostly disagree with this man's impressions of the vocals. "Trail of Fire" and "Savant" are two of the most vocally well-delivered pieces of music I've ever heard, and I certainly don't hear any of the "wannabe American rock/emo-pop" stylings this man is referring to (except maybe during a few parts of "Sleeping Dogs and Dead Lions," but that's beside the point).
p9186
aVWell then... thanks for saving me the time looking for a bad review of Sound Awake!

aVYes! I had posted Gutter Moon a bit back, didn't catch on, hope the album gets a bit of attention. I was surprised that they released it for free, really is a great product with a unique sound, as you said. \u000a\u000aFascinating guitar and bass tones, they sound like they could almost be synths (and I know there's synths for reinforcement), but it's just so thick and crunchy. Bass sounds a bit like Karnivool, that awesome fuzziness to it. Huge mix overall, getting that wall of sound going strong.\u000a\u000aAfter a couple listens, [Owls is probably my favorite for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ltBx5svW8k), but haven't really delved into it much, so that'll probably change.\u000a\u000aOnly complaint so far is that a lot of the songs seem very similar structured, about a minute instrumental intro, 1st verse with slightly thinner instrumental texture or just the bass line for accompaniment, thick verses with additional synths. Gives it a bit of same-y feeling, but once I've spun it a couple more times I'll see if they feel more distinct.

p9264
(lp9265
VThis is the best thing I have ever heard. I can't believe I have never seen or heard this with how much I have listened to the original.
p9266
aVLoved what they did with the Gershwin piece, but what I can't figure out is why the super tame video/lighting effects? Of course their collective musicianship is extraordinary but I've always loved a show to have some kickass lighting and visual effects as well. 
p9267
aVI mean, their tours were more of just a few shows that are organized to be very cheap, so that's probably why.  Renting Lights/Video is really expensive, and when the tour is 10 dates it's not really worth it.
p9268
aVYeah it was a reunion tour and it seems like they wanted to keep it more casual as well. Still doesn't take away from what an awesome interpretation of the original they performed. 
p9269
aVI really hope they do another tour, but it really depends on JP.  Mike and Jordan actually have a good relationship and always have since the split, but from my understanding, John isn't too happy about Mike.
p9270
aVI mainly asked because I work in live sound, video, and lighting production. Working rock shows are some of my favorite gigs so I'm more surprised that such a famous band can't get a budget together. Most venues have existing setups with house technicians anyways

p9277
(lp9278
VI hear a lot of love for Blackwater Park, but for me this album, alongside Still Life, is their best. 
p9279
aVI feel like I hold Blackwater Park in such high regard and above all their other albums simply because that is what got me into metal as a genre and I don't know where I'd be, or what I'd be listening to now if it wasn't for that beautiful record. But in all honesty, I have a really hard time placing those three albums above or below one another. They're all flawless and jaw dropping. 
p9280
aVI completely agree. I got into Opeth with Orchid, but pretty much every release, sans Heritage and Pale Communion, has continually managed to instill that sense of why I love Opeth so much. I love Watershed just as much as I love My Arms, Your Hearse, albeit for different reasons. 
p9281
aVAgree 100%. But to be fair, we have to acknowledge that just about every Opeth Album is of the highest quality and so I can see why different people have different albums-of-choice. 
p9282
aVWhat I love most about Opeth: this is probably the worst song they've ever made. And I still like it. 
p9283
aVSomeone hasn't listened to Heritage lately.
p9284
aVI love Opeth and appreciate what they were going for on Heritage, but the transitions on that album make me sad. So immersion breaking. 
p9285
aVWe can all agree that Heir Apparent is one of their best songs, right?\u000a\u000aEDIT: Ignore that this is a completely irrelevant statement...
p9286
aVAgreed. But Heir Apparent is on Watershed.
p9287
aVhurp\u000a\u000aI'm just so used to people bagging on Watershed; it's a reflex of mine to defend it.
p9288
aVPeople bag on Watershed? Defiantly my most listened to Opeth album.
p9289
aVNot that I hate it but when Lindgren left they lost so much of that bluesy soulful soloing. Akesson is an amazing guitarrist but I don't think be fits in opeth.
p9290
aVBut they threw Burden at us and proceeded to blues out like they've never done before. 
p9291
aVI can agree with you on that for sure, but solos in general are not really my thing.
p9292
aVActually, Mike plays most of the bluesier stuff, I'm pretty sure. Peter also played those sweeping licks that I always loved, but Mike is definitely one of the most soulful soloers in metal. 
p9293
aVHeritage is nice in its own way, but it's too different for me to get behind it (with hints of that different-ness visible in watershed).\u000a\u000aPrior to the release of Heritage, i bought tickets to a concert which fell after the release. I was quite disappointed when the concert featured almost exclusively songs off of heritage, with one or two from watershed. Not because the songs were bad, but because they were different from my expectations. I think the only older song was [Face of Melinda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGg155CcGKE) which, though a beautiful song, is basically the song of "alright, let me catch my breath, and you in the audience can go get a fresh beer". \u000a\u000aIn contrast, the previous Opeth concert i attended was amazing, and i still get a rush when i remember headbanging to the relentless percussive repetition in the last couple 3.5 minutes of [Deliverance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0T-TPXS1M0).
p9294
aVIn regards to your last comment, my personal favorite Opeth groove section similar to the end of Deliverance is the one at the end of Harlequin Forest.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nIo3lpXrc5A#t=599
p9295
aVOooh, yes, i like that part too :)\u000a\u000a... as well as the whole song.
p9296
aVIt works for me. I like plenty of music that isn't really metal. And I can appreciate Heritage for the prog rock that it is. \u000a\u000aI didn't like Heritage much at all until I listened to a couple of the songs live. It was way more enjoyable than I anticipated  and really complemented the rest of their set...which had a bunch of their older and more intense material.
p9297
aVI like a lot of prog rock as well, but in relation to their other releases, Heritage is their weakest, imo. I prefer Damnation's prog-rock stylings over what they did in Heritage. Perhaps if they took what they learned in Damnation into Heritage I might be a bit more open to the album in general.
p9298
aVI like Heritage, but I think Pale Communion is a lot better. PC is easily in my top 5 Opeth albums.
p9299
aVYeah, it is one of the only songs Opeth has made (and the only on Ghost Reveries) which garnered nothing more than a "meh" from me. Easily one of their worst songs.
p9300
aVOne of my top 5 favourite Opeth songs to be honest, this is tied for my favourite Opeth record. It seems like the best middle ground between the old and current Opeth to me.
p9301
aVI had heard of opeth my freshman year of college in 2002. Blackwater Park was really interesting, but for whatever reason it didn't really like STICK as a band I would need to check out in my mind. I was just finding out about stuff like dimmu borgir, strapping young lad, soilwork, in flames. All I had exposure to previously was shit like metallica, pantera, megadeth, and slayer.\u000a\u000aThis whole album is really dynamic. I saw opeth live in 2005 with strapping young lad for sounds of the underground. When this song came on, everything else just clicked. \u000a\u000aI went home, checked out this album and the keyboardist walked through all the best instruments: Vibes, mellotron, organ, fender rhodes piano (it's tube driven so you get a real warm tone). Organ and rhodes together really sealed the deal though.\u000a\u000aThen the groove at the end was just lightening to my brain.\u000a\u000aAnyway, this song really stood out because of the Guitar and keyboard in the intro. It really sets the tone. When the chorus hits and the growls come out, you have that raw as fuck but damp/muted organ, in the background. I was headbanging with goosebumps the first time i heard it. The calculated precision for which they pick sounds is just so hard to explain in words. You have to pick the songs apart and listen for those little individual nuances, but god damn they add up.
p9302
aVSounds even better with the double bass drum at [6:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kKNT3PdDkE#t=6m18s)
p9303
aVSo much yes. It's even better jamming along!
p9304
aVI like the music but the cookie monster vocals ruin it for me.  I do want to like it just not sure how to get into that.  I'm told the two recent releases have a different style though
p9305
aVYeah, three of their albums have only clean vocals and are all progrock rather than progmetal: Damnation, Heritage, and Pale Communion. The latter two being the most recent; Damnation came out in 2003.  \u000a\u000aHeritage sounds the most different of the three. PC is arguably the "heaviest" of the three, but not necessarily metal. Personally, I don't like Heritage but I like the other two (Damnation is way better than PC in my opinion as it has more of that Opeth sound; PC sounds like a 70's prog record).  \u000a\u000aThere are also completely clean songs from their other albums. Some examples include: A Fair Judgement, Porcelain Heart, Burden, Hours of Wealth, etc. However, A Fair Judgement is probably their heaviest song with completely clean vocals. I personally like the duality of the harsh vocals with the cleans, but I know a lot of people are turned off by the death growls. If you are trying to get into the harsh vocals of Opeth, try songs like The Lotus Eater, Harlequin Forest, The Drapery Falls, and Hessian Peel. These songs have more clean than harsh.   \u000a\u000aOpeth is a really great band when you really delve into their discography. I hope this helps.

I don't dislike all roaring vocals, In the past I've loved the music of slayer and coroner and some similar .  I just need a trigger for this band to get me into that . Thanks !

p9314
aVYou bet. Massively underrated band Riverside is.
p9315
aVProbably my favorite too. I've had this album for while, but I never really listened to it that much. I had a listen through when I first got it, but was a little turned off by some of the harsh vocals in the second and third songs, so I usually just listen to Reality Dream I and II (Which are awesome). Only recently did I take the time to give the beginning a shot again, and I was surprised I had totally missed how awesome this song was. \u000a\u000aI'm not a huge Riverside fan, so I haven't heard of that subreddit. Go ahead and cross post it there if you want. I don't care about karma.

As is the music. Really like this. So much has been posted in this sub the past couple of days that has grabbed my attention. Now I just need time to sift through it all and take in all these albums!

(lp9398
VFrom reading the comments here, I am getting the gist that the creator of this song is OP?
p9399
aVThat would be me! I play bass in the band and actually wrote this particular song. The full EP just went up on our Bandcamp! https://escher.bandcamp.com/
p9400
aVBruh... The feels I got were real. This is great stuff.
p9401
aVReally glad you dig it man! We're very proud of this one!

aVPicked up the cassette tape they released for this EP from Schoolkids Records in Raleigh.  Been jamming to it in the car, sick stuff.
p9404
aVSoooo sick! We're actually playing a free show at Schoolkids on Friday the 13th next month, we'll have details on Facebook soon! Our EP release is also tomorrow night, 1/21, at Maywood with Cryptodira and Wings Denied if you can make it out!

aVHey cool song man. Really kept the essence of your sound while improving on it. That last section was radical. Keep up the good work.

asVAn interview I did with Michael Lessard of The Contortionist - Primordial Sounds Come To Life: The Tangled Minds of The Contortionist | Antidote Magazine
p9411
(lp9412
VGood interview! \u000a\u000aI have to be honest, I didn't like the lyrics on Language as much as Johnathan's Carpenter's lyrics on the previous two LP's. I found they lost that sciency/nature feel and went full on Philosophy 101. They are still growing on me and the music in the album is fantastic. I'm very optimistic for their next release! Hopefully another concept album that is a little less vague. 
p9413
aVSeems really weird to ask Lessard on the evolution of the band as if he's been in it for all three albums. You do know that he just joined the band right? 
p9414
aVYes I was aware, but he was able to explain things from the "outside looking in". I did originally write the questions for the entire band but only Mike was available before the show to talk. 
p9415
aVYour article states that Michael Lessard is new and the part about "outside looking in". It is a well written article.
p9416
aVOh okay. Why did not you clear that up when you wrote it? Really turned me off from the interview.
p9417
aVDamn, you are a jerk.
p9418
aVYeah I am. Still, the questions in the article are worded as if Mike has been with the band since its inception, which is wrong. It immediately jumped out at me. Although the writer knows it, it makes me think of him as either sloppy or unprofessional. I tried to not come off as a jerk in this instance, I just wanted to help the guy.
p9419
aV&gt;From the outside looking in, being someone who had toured with The Contortionist in my older band, I enjoyed the band and felt like there was something special in the band. \u000a\u000aCry about it
p9420
aV&gt;All three studio albums have been tied together with some sort of concept. What compelled you to have a unifying theme to each of your albums so far?\u000a\u000a&gt;When the band started in 2007, did you expect the level of success that you have now?\u000a\u000aThese are not questions you ask someone who has been in the band for almost two years. A simple rewording of the questions in the article would have fixed this immediately. It makes me think he didn't do his research and thus makes me not want to read his interview. 
p9421
aVLike I said,\u000a\u000aCry about it
p9422
aVI am. Can't you read? Your comment implies that you can, but who knows at this point. I'm giving the TC some constructive criticism, even if he didn't ask for it. I have no idea how serious of a writer he wants to be. \u000a\u000aIt's not like it's a bad interview. He asked solid questions, outside of the two I had a problem with (which were only problems with the wording). It's better than the myriad of interviews that bands post that have the same standard five questions about the band and whatnot.
p9423
aV&gt;c r y   a b o u t   i t
p9424
aVSorry about that, didn't think it was useful information. And I'm not very good at improv, so I stuck with my pre-written questions. Mike was still nice enough to offer his opinion anyway.
p9425
aVIt's okay man. Just trying to help you out.
p9426
aVgood questions on this interview!
p9427
asVBands with only one guitarist?
p9428
(lp9429
VRush and Dream Theater seem to do all right. 
p9430
aVThe keys really adds a lot to the layering though, especially with how ridiculous of a rig Jordan Rudess has, so many sounds at his fingertips.
p9431
aVGeddy plays a lot of keys with his feet too, like in freewill. 
p9432
aVIt seems like every time I hear something new about Geddy Lee it only serves to blow my mind even further.
p9433
aVAlso, if you watch some talks Petrucci has done he talks about changing the way he plays to give a slightly thicker sound due to only having one guitarist.  
p9434
aVThank You Scientist only have one guitarist. I saw them live with Periphery on Friday and they melted my face. 
p9435
aVThank You Scientist killed it when they were in Portland. So much energy!
p9436
aVYeah I never really listened to them but they were amazing and I immediately bought their album on vinyl. Should be here anyday 
p9437
aVI was there at the Fillmore too! Band kicks ass. Got them to sign my CD too
p9438
aVDamn, now i really wish i would of went over to their merch table, but i had front row and I didn't want to lose it.\u000a
p9439
aVThey were there signing after the show was already over
p9440
aVI was upset because they were the only band besides Periphery on that bill which I wanted to see, and they couldn't make it to my city :(
p9441
aVDysrhythmia\u000a\u000aTool
p9442
aVDysrhythmia is a great example of a prog band with one guitar player who really finds good ways to explore the space left by not having a second guitar.  I love Kevin Hufnagel's playing.  He's a fucking beast.\u000a\u000aCynic is also a great band with only one guitar player.  And I love  Baring Teeth.
p9443
aVA lot of that space is filled by having a great bass player who uses a pick and sounds like a second guitar in many cases.  This is certainly true for Colin Marston and Justin Chancellor.  Half the time you can't even tell which part is being played by which instrument.  Love that shit.
p9444
aVDysrhythmia is a band that can be truly described as "stacked."  I love the sound of one guitar and one bass, especially when they're really killer players.  The guitarist that doesn't have a second guitar player to worry about can really make some dynamic and bold textural choices.  \u000a\u000aI've come to prefer a one-guitar configuration for that reason.

aVBorn of Osiris only has Lee McKinney now
p9450
aVYeah, though the only two albums with Lee McKinney being the only guitarist is A Higher Place and Tomorrow We Die Alive.
p9451
aVAlso, A Higher Place was recorded with a Lead and Rhythm guitar and when they toured that album they needed guitarists to tour with them (Tosin Abasi, Lee Evans). So even then their was not really one guitar.
p9452
aVI honestly hate A Higher Place. 
p9453
aV[Dionaea](http://dionaea.bandcamp.com/album/still) 
p9454
aVThe Aristocrats, Tool, Rush, Symphony X
p9455
aVErra is one of my favorite bands hands down.  I'm not sure about their albums, Impulse and Augment, but their new EP, Moments of Clarity, only uses one guitarist.  Honestly, every song on it is good, but my favorites are [Dreamcatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2a0firXFc) and [Lights City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZPhrc6G1mg)
p9456
aVHow do they play it live though? that's the big problem here for us, they may only have one guitarist, but they are multitracking a ton.  We not superduper prog, more in the gojira progressive death kinda thing, so it might be a smidgen easier, but this stuff all has heavy usage of multiple guitars.
p9457
aVI can't say for sure, but in all likelihood: backing tracks out the ASS
p9458
aVTrue but I've really wanted to avoid this.  I'm more of a traditional death and black metal guy, so the realm of prog is a bit new to me and so is all the layering and effects and stuff, so maybe my avoidance is just because I have no experience with it.
p9459
aVwell you could take the dream theater approach and have a dual amp set up for your rhythm guitars. You could also maybe try experimenting with live-looping Animals as Leaders-style
p9460
aVThey have a second guitarist live, no  sure if he is part of the band or just a touring member. 
p9461
aVThe bassist moved to guitar and they have a touring bassist.
p9462
aVFrost* has only one guitarist. Their keyboard work amazes me to the point that I wasn't sure if they had a guitarist until I looked them up.

aVAyreon isn't really a band, it's a guys solo thing and each album has like a million musicians on it, they are kick-ass though.

aVWhy does anyone on here downvote anything anyway? There is no downvote button, that should be a dead giveaway that it goes against the best interests of the community. Not only that, but downvoting is supposed to hide irrelevant comments, but when threads only have at most 50 comments, what's the point? We can all still see the comment. Downvoting achieves nothing.
p9480
aVLol I got a lot of heat in that thread. I used to be able to express negativity on this board and not get buried. Now all the "youtube comment section"-type periphery fans have found this board and it's now off-limits to say a single negative thing about periphery
p9481
aV[deleted]
p9482
aVIs there a bot out there that can just append a big "In my humble opinion, of course" to the end of everyone's posts? Because that should just be mentally implied when reading here. \u000a\u000aI know that some of the points in the other thread were being stated "as facts" but really, it just comes down to taste and I think ultimately everyone in there realized it. The guy wasn't saying they suck and should be murdered, he just found the new stuff poppier (in however he perceives it) and it doesn't have to affect anyone else's opinions on the music. \u000a\u000aAt least there weren't any 10-page posts about how Periphery literally don't know how to play their instruments or that Cynic is mallcore ;)
p9483
aVThis has always been a big problem with the internet. One guy states an opinion likes it's a fact, another guy disagrees, 10 page long argument ensues. For some reason certain people can't grasp that if something looks like a fact, but you don't agree with it, then it's their opinion, and thus there's no need to argue if it's right or wrong.
p9484
aVActually I disagree with your opinion that opinions aren't facts and that is my universally correct opinion-fact!\u000a\u000aKidding! And it's definitely just an overall internet thing; it can be great for learning about different perspectives, but only if someone's open to having their own views challenged or rejected. Unfortunately I don't know if there's much more that can done to get people to be more tolerant on here.
p9485
aVThis doesn't need to be it's own thread...
p9486
aVIt's sad because it's exactly for that reason that I left /r/metal.
p9487
aVWelcome to reddit.
p9488
aVWell, I always thought this subreddit to be above that in a sense.
p9489
aVLook on the bright side - it only happens in Periphery threads.
p9490
aVWas it his opinion that people were down voting? Or the way he expressed it/ was he making valid points or just saying blatantly untrue things? 
p9491
aVThis is approaching the crux of the issue. He/she was doing the ol' "my opinions are the indisputable facts of the matter" style of writing, rather than presenting opinions in a way that would foster discussion instead of kneejerk retorts and downvotes. Absolute statements are almost never going to result in pleasant exchanges.\u000a\u000aI've had differing opinions on a lot of things around here, and I'm certainly capable of being a bit tactless in some of my postings, and those are the ones that get the most (deserved) flack. On the other hand, when I keep my tone non-aggressive and, you know, leave room for people to have different thoughts, I've gotten some great in-depth responses, even when we have irreconcilable differences of opinion (e.g. - had a huge multi-day argument about Pink Lemonade that still managed to end on a good note). \u000a\u000aEDIT: Misspelled 'aggressive' like some sort of Neanderthal. Fixed it.
p9492
aVI believe it was the guy who said that Juggernaut was Periphery's least progressive album. I agree with him in the true sense of prog, but it definitely fits under the prog label.\u000a\u000aHe then went on to describe the album as pop metal. \u000a\u000aIt's pretty obvious why he got downvoted.
p9493
aVAlbeit, he probably should've expressed his opinion a little more gently, but he isn't necessarily wrong in my eyes.
p9494
aVMy issue was that he seemed incapable of saying anything beyond those points. Saying it's pop metal is fine, but what makes it 'pop'? I'm assuming it's the flamboyant vocals, but that was never brought up. He just kept saying pop metal and listing some songs over and over. He also kept saying P2 was more progressive, but couldn't seem to expand on that point either. Differing opinions are fine and can lead to some awesome discussion, but you should be able to explain what about the music makes you feel that way.
p9495
aVSome of those posts deserved downvotes. Not all of them, but some. 
p9496
aVHonestly, *in my humble opinion* (urgh), I kind of agreed with the guy, at least if you look at Juggernaut: Alpha, a lot of the songs aren't *that* proggy on it. And if you like proggy music, that's probably a negative. From what I've gathered, a lot of people on here do in fact prefer Omega, which is the *proggier* of the two albums.\u000a\u000aHeck, if you, for example, go on the [sputnikmusic page for Periphery](http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Periphery/11436/), Omega has a higher user score - I'm willing to bet that's partially because a lot of prog fans listen to Periphery, and a lot of them found Alpha a bit less appetising than Omega. I know I did.\u000a\u000aBut they're both neat albums so whatever. Omega was on perma listen for me last week. I think it's weird that they released two albums at the same time but it again, kind of emphasises the dissonance between the two - the fact that Juggernaut wasn't one single album.\u000a\u000aI think the dude probably suffered from neg inflation.
p9497
aVOkay um,\u000a\u000a1. I don't think it was his opinion that was downvoted, it was more the fact that he came into a Periphery thread about something Periphery achieved to badmouth Periphery. While it's completely valid to dislike the band, his comment wasn't really constructive and had a derailing influence on the thread.\u000a\u000a2. I don't like Periphery either, in fact I don't consider them to be prog at all, at any point in their existence, so it's really annoying that of late this subreddit has been infested with their fans and bloated with posts centred on the band, when better artists could have more exposure. They're a pop rock band. They do not belong on this subreddit.\u000a\u000a3. Nonetheless, I have taken the road of just ignoring them. I don't think going into Periphery threads and shitposting is a good way to express anything.
p9498
aV&gt; While it's completely valid to dislike the band\u000a\u000aI don't dislike the band, they are in my top 5. I was just expressing my disappointment with juggernaut. I even said I would prefer they make music they want to, rather than music which will please fans of the old albums. But that still doesn't make me like juggernaut and that's all I'm saying
p9499
aVJust curious, what would you classify Periphery I?
p9500
aVCloser to metalcore than prog metal, like 95% of "djent" bands 
p9501
aV&gt;They're a pop rock band. They do not belong on this subreddit.\u000a\u000aIt's those types of statements that have a "derailing influence" on a thread, because you seem to be stating your opinion as fact.\u000a\u000aYou are obviously entitled to express your opinion, but if you aren't careful about how you write said opinion, then what could have been a constructive discussion turns into a classic internet argument.
p9502
aVI thought since we all enjoy Progressive Metal that we'd be open to (and allow) opinions and understand the fact that *we all have different musical tastes and preferences*.
p9503
aVWe don't have the fame of being elitist from nothing. Obviously that's a generalization, but almost all of them have a base in the truth.
p9504
aV[deleted]
p9505
aVI kinda agree with what he says. It's definitely not as wanky as past Periphery records and some of the songs are simpler. That doesn't mean the prog and wank aren't there though. What's bothering me the most is when people are talking about Alpha and Omega in absolutes. It's Alpha is shit pop metal (wtf does that even mean) and Omega is Dj0nthurrderr. There's shit on both of the records that's all over the place. There is content for everybody here.

VMan, they've come a long way from their s/t in 2011. I remember hearing the breakdown in Timeframes and being so confused at first. Definitely what got me into djenty music. 
p9511
aVBecause their name reminded me of The Safety Fire [I know, I know, not really similar] I gave it a listen with pretty high hopes. But they're a pretty run-of-the-mill djent band. Not a bad band, but nothing out of the ordinary.\u000a\u000aBut the lighter part at the end was really good! I liked it quite a bit.

aVBlack Crown Initiate have taken the torch in my eyes.\u000a\u000aBut this is excellent news to kick off 2015!
p9562
aVBCI needs to swing back a little bit toward the Opeth direction - a little too much death metal on TWoS for their own good. But there's no question they have the chops to do it!
p9563
aVWhile I harbor no ill will toward BCI, they're nothing compared to Opeth. That's just me though.
p9564
aVI don't necessarily compare when I say that. It's mainly that I can hear enough tasteful influence that (until this news) they have that mantle for me.\u000a\u000aYou REALLY need to check out song of the crippled bull. It's a better explanation to me saying that
p9565
aVI listened to the track after seeing it on the front page. It was impressive, but I'd still consider Be'lakor more of a successor than BCI.\u000a\u000aYou should definitely check them out, if you haven't. I recommend the track *[Abeyance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYBgWgjjgxQ)*.

aVThat's unfortunate, I think that Heritage and Pale Communion are Opeth's best albums.
p9573
aVI think the only reason they stopped doing records with screaming is because Mikael Åkerfeldt just got bored of making that type of music. Or something like that, don't quote me on it. Either way though, I'd love to hear another super heavy album. 
p9574
aVI'd rather have Åkerfeldt make the music he wants to make rather than force out another death metal album just because his fans insist he does. That never results in good music.  \u000aOn the other hand, if he's down for another death metal album then that would be fucking awesome.
p9575
aVOkay, well Pale Communion and Heritage were mediocre albums so I think that sort of debunks your theory. Mikael writing what he wants to write or not has no impact on whether the album would be good. 
p9576
aVYou seriously think musical creativity has nothing to do with how passionate you are about what you're writing? It has *everything* to do with it. Say what you will about Pale Communion and Heritage but they were both passionate albums and I really like them. They might not be your cup of tea but trust me, if Opeth decided to do another death metal album just for the sake of making money but not because they actually wanted to, that album would totally suck.
p9577
aVSo effectively, the same shite they've been saying since 2010, to trick dm fans into buying the next album.\u000a\u000aWhy does every Prog Metal band have to become a really dreary Prog Rock band? These 2 albums are pretty much Opeth's Load and ReLoad, completely unnecessary and done to death and not to mention dull as dishwater.

p9591
(lp9592
VI've said it before, and I'll say it again, I love the wave of cheerful/uplifting metal of the last couple years. Nothing against more aggressively-oriented music, and there's certainly times when I just want to be energized by some loud metal, but most of the time I want groove and melody, and this has it in spades. \u000a\u000aAlmost some post-rocky textures, the synths in particular remind me of Maybeshewill or something (I Was Here For a Moment, Then I Was Gone in particular), but I haven't gotten such a nice vibe from a djenty song in quite some time. Closest I can think of off the top of my head would be the guitarist from Uneven Structure's [major reinterpretation of Admit Defeat](https://soundcloud.com/worc/admet-des-faits-monuments) originally by Monuments.

aVLovelovelove this dvd! Watching it again makes me want to go to my 8th or 9th BTBAM concert. Few things in this world are better than being surrounded by fans all conducting the bands off kilter guitar riffs and kit hits with their hands. Always an incredible experience. 
p9600
aVI love BTBAM and there shows are so amazing. \u000a\u000aThis is still one of my top 3 shows I've seen live. 
p9601
aVYou were there? Ugh. Is it completely ridiculous to be jealous of someone I've never met? Haha
p9602
aVHaha! No, I don't think so. :)
p9603
aVSuch a good album. I went to the cd release show and it was one the best shows ever. Damnit, they need to finish recording and do some shows!
p9604
aVSame here dude! The line up for that tour was unreal. Seeing BTBAM, HORSE the Band, and Animosity on a school night as a 14 year old tore my mind apart. 
p9605

p9609
aVOh yeah, I definitely hear it. Never noticed that before. I guess I should have played more Spyro.

asVOpeth - Demon of the Fall
p9613
(lp9614
VThis is quite possibly one of their most popular show songs. In honor of that, and because Mikael is a bit of a smart-ass, they did an acoustic version of it in their 2013 summer tour.\u000a\u000aExample: http://youtu.be/iJAWvlePwnA
p9615
aVAs enticing as that performance was, I couldn't help but feel like I had been trolled when they busted out the acoustics for this song. As far as I'm concerned, Mike et al. can do no wrong, and I suppose it's an experience to listen to DotF "unplugged" once, after a handful of traditional performances. Still, I'm partial to the original.
p9616
aVWhen they started playing this, my friend and I both turned towards each other and exclaimed simultaneously "Oh noes, Grandspas guitars!"

asVNon-metal flair suggestion
p9635
(lp9636
VI hope you didnt see my reply as "jumping down your throat"!  I didn't mean it that way. 
p9637
aVDon't worry, it didn't come across that way at all. 
p9638
aVNo, not at all man don't worry :) Just a figure of speech I guess.
p9639
aVI'm sorry that people reacted the way they did, but this is something we most likely won't implement. It's too open for interpretation, unlike our current flairs which are easily distinguishable from one another.
p9640
aVThat's a shame. I find myself frequently wanting to post music here that I know will catch the interest of users because of the many genre overlaps and tangential sounds that exist between prog metal and the rest of music, but am usually hesitant as I don't know how people will react. \u000a\u000aAnd im not saying this sub as a whole isn't open to having posts linking to non prog metal songs right now, but it would be cool if it there was a way to encourage posts of that nature, as well as help people weed through them if they aren't interested in or looking for something not directly related to metal. 
p9641
aVWell, I don't think you should be discouraged to do so. There are many "success stories" if you will of people posting non metal here and being pretty much universally appreciated by users (Snarky Puppy and Reign of Kindo come to mind as examples).
p9642
aVdoes that mean you scrapped the idea for genre flairs that you guys brought up a while ago?
p9643
aVCan you imagine the shit storm that would create?\u000a\u000a"That's not post-progressive doom it's neo-trash melodeath!"
p9644
aVlol, yes that's a possibility. though the genre tags would have been less specific, but i could see it prompting tons of useless comments trying to correct OP's decision.
p9645
aVWe have not scrapped it, just hopelessly neglected it. Things like AMAs and the Hall of Fame reprioritized themselves. \u000a\u000aBut again, it's not something that's off the table. But we are admittedly still somewhat hesitant seeing as the community seemed pretty split over whether or not it was a feature they wanted. (Among some other miscellaneous potential problems it could create)
p9646
aVhonestly i would love to have a topic once in a while where we prog people just discuss what we are listening too.\u000a\u000areign of kindo, little tybee &amp; tottoro is some of the non metal bands I've found on this sub that i would probably never find any other way,i just dont see myself going to alot of other genre subs when I mostly listen to prog.\u000a\u000ait seems alot of people on /r/progmetal like the same music outside of this genre, this could also filter out some of the (not sure if this belong here) topics.
p9647
aV&gt; So my suggestion is obviously not to exclude this stuff\u000a\u000aI am of the opposite opinion. Non-metal should absolutely not be posted here. There's /r/progrock and /r/progrockmusic already. But what do I know...\u000a\u000aAnd you flair idea is funny if looked in another light. It's like suggesting a "Non-gaming" flair for /r/pcgaming

aVI think a "ProgMetal Related" flair would fit better...

p9652
aVTook me a while to get around to checking out Ulver which I really dig now, but I got there via his work on this album.
p9653
aVThe Sham Mirrors is one of my all-time favorite Records - K. Rygg and Sverd were an outstanding combo 
p9654
aVDefinitely check out La Masquerade Infernale as well. It's slightly overlooked compared to Sham Mirrors (which does deserve its praise, either way). 
p9655
aVI've heard it, and I think I liked it but it didn't grab me like Sham Mirrors.  I think it was lacking the sci-fi vibe that I enjoyed.  I'll probably give it another go at work today.
p9656
aVIt's weirder, I will say that. Maybe that's not a trait that'll grab people easily, but I still recommend giving it a fairer shake.

Like they do this incredible origin story of the band and then go "they made 2112, farewell to kings, then this record called moving pictures, now its 2010 and they still play!!!!"\u000a\u000aDefinitely worth watching though if your a fan or curious.

VHis best album IMO
p9669
aVAs much as i like the album, I think it's nowhere near Insurgentes
p9670
aVI still like Raven better, but I think there can be no argument that this is his most cohesive, best sounding output. He's better than he's ever been, and that's saying something. 
p9671
aVEasily the most disgusting track on the album. I locked my doors and hid after I listened to this.\u000aBest SW solo album. AOTY for me. 
p9672
aVThe only 2 artists I listen to who have released albums this year are periphery and steven wilson so I can't quite say its AOTY yet, especially when Leprous and Tesseract are releasing albums this year
p9673
aVI love this album. I love it so much. I might consider it the best thing he's ever released, even better than the last four Porcupine Tree albums (which are four of the best prog albums of all time, IMO). It's just absolutely incredible from start to finish. 
p9674
aVAs someone who is waiting to listen in full when it's released, this comment is extremely exciting :-)
p9675
aVWait, what. I thought it was released today, that's why I listened to it! God damn it. 
p9676
aVTuesday for US folks (me) :p
p9677
aVI'm in the U.S.! I've listened to it like 7 times now because I thought my CD was coming tomorrow. Wikipedia said it came out today so I took it at that. Oh well. It's incredible, you won't be disappointed.

aVWell Ancestral is pretty good IMO.\u000a[link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6bF6oKJKKQ)
p9683
aVI'm not very familiar with most of his work - I've listened to a couple of Porcupine Tree albums and Raven. So far I really like this one, because it's so diverse. It's got some cool industrial/ambient songs on it, some songs bordering pop, some amazing - and sometimes heavy - 70s prog parts (Like this one) and then there are eerie, haunting songs like "Ancestral", which so far, is my absolute favorite.
p9684
aVYou should check out some of his older Porcupine Tree work -  listen to Radioactive Toy in particular. 
p9685
aVAlso, listen to *Insurgentes*. It's incredible.

aVI never thought he'd outdo *Insurgentes* or *The Raven*, but he damn well did.

p9690
aVYOU DRAW THE BOTTOM LINE WITH A DOLLAR SIGN!  Love this one!  Definitely agree that it's not the same without Charlie and Kevin.  A lot of people have trouble tolerating Charlie's voice though, which I can understand.  Petrucci wrote some wild ass solos on this album.\u000a\u000aThough, I'll never understand why Another Won didn't make the album.  Its such a ballsy song.  Wish that one made it. 
p9691
aVMany people think this is one of DT's absolute worst songs but I actually kinda like it
p9692
aVThe whole first album is very underrated IMO. I think it suffers from having bad production, a weak vocalist, and less focused songwriting, but it's still pretty charming and has a lot more soul than some of their more polished later albums. 
p9693
aVisn't there a remastered version that sounds better?

aVAlso Jon Carpenter. I'm pretty sure he was the main lyricist for Exoplanet and Intrinsic. If you've never followed along with the lyrics of Exoplanet, I recommend it for sure. It's a stellar story from start to finish. And Intrinsic has some of the neatest lyrical melodies. Geocentric Confusion &lt;3

aVYeah man, I've actually enjoyed all the singers the contortionist have gone through (I've been listening to them for a while).

aVI have to give it to Kevin Moore (ex-Dream Theater, OSI, Chroma Key) He is easily my favourite Dream Theater lyricist, and his work in OSI (even Chroma Key despite them not being metal) continues to be truly unique and even distinctively stylistic.\u000a\u000aI also have to put one in for Daniel Gildenlow from Pain of Salvation.

aVGood question!\u000a\u000aI'd certainly agree with your choice for Ashe O'Hara. Altered State is incredibly poetic.

Maynard James Keenan from Tool is brilliant too: Lateralus and Right In Two are great examples.\u000a\u000aMy absolute favourite would probably be Adrian Fitipaldes. He was just great in Northlane. It was accessible, simple, uplifting and spread a great spiritual message. Singularity lead me to look into DMT and Terence McKenna - which kicked off my own spiritual journey, so I have a lot to be grateful for there.\u000a\u000a"Now I hear the voices of an ancient race\u000aPeering through the veil of time and space\u000aEmerging from the void I am reborn\u000aI see the world for what it really is\u000aDistorted visions of heaven\u000aI have discovered there's hope in my heart\u000a\u000aFor I am One\u000aI am One\u000aI am Love\u000aI am Bliss, I am Everything\u000aI am Everything you fear\u000aEverything you've ever known\u000aBut don't be scared (but don't be scared), for I am here"\u000a- Northlane/Worldeater.

aVProgressive metal isn't exactly a genre known for its great lyricists, but there are some great ones out there. For my favorite I'd go with Cornelius Jakhelln (Solefald, Sturmgeist), who I think is great overall. His lyrics are generlly really clever and philosophical and he's great at poetry. But he has also written some really silly and weird lyrics, and I can never decide if he's a genius or just insane. And some of his lyrics are in Norwegian, which I don't understand and can't properly judge.
p9752
aVIf we include artists that are on the fringe of genre's Neil Peart is an amazing lyricist.\u000a\u000aIf it's band that are pretty much in prog metal, Daniel Gildenlow or old John Myung (90-97 era)
p9753
aVI agree with almost all the responses here so far, but the Duplantier brothers have written some great lines with Gojira.\u000a\u000a*The way I see things is so simple  \u000aThe fact I'm walking standing on this land  \u000aThe way I see myself  \u000aSo confused so sophisticated  \u000aTry not to get it anymore*\u000a
p9754
aVDarroh Sudderth from Fair to Midland not only has one of the most magical voices in prog, he writes some of the most incredibly obtuse and poetic lyrics I've ever heard. Ian Kenney (Karnivool, Birds of Tokyo), Andrew Mailloux (Rishloo), and Damian Wilson (Headspace, Threshold, Ayreon) are also in the running.
p9755
aVI love Darroh's play on words, like in [Musical Chairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsDJih0yYgk):\u000a\u000a*"I could be kicking the bucket,\u000aBut you should know, I never had very good aim."*\u000a\u000aSometimes it's hard to comprehend how fucking fantastic that band was.

aVI envy you, sir. I've only seen them once and didn't get to see that one. I did however catch a Romeo pick!
p9778
aVNice! It was a little bittersweet though. The only reason they played it that tour was because Nevermore and Soilwork both dropped off the tour at the last second. As my luck would have it, Nevermore dropped off because two members quit and killed the band before I could see them.

aVI just recently started listening to this CD again. This song is truly one of the multipart epic greats.
p9780
aVI've been making my way through the whole discography again, and it has aged quite well. They put some great stuff together for sure! Michael Romeo is a great writer/Shred master, but without Russel Allen, this band loses more than two testicles.

p9790
aVOver the course of the next three days, I will try those out!
p9791
aVI like that attitude!
p9792
aVI can especially vouch for Frost*'s Milliontown. I saw someone reference it inconspicuously in a thread a few weeks ago and now I can't get enough of it. 
p9793
aVArcane's Known/Learned has only recently been released and "Learned" is already one of my absolute favourite epics. The whole Known/Learned double album is incredible actually.
p9794
aVI basically haven't stopped listening to it since it came out. It's rapidly shifting from "album of the year" consideration to "all-time great" status.
p9795
aVI'm more of a Change of Season kind of guy, but I've definitely given this song plenty of listens. It's very epic.
p9796
aVHell yes. It's 24 minutes of excellence and it never feels like it. Makes time fly for me. Great for road trips too (when no one else is in the car and you can sing along at full volume...)

aVOne of my favorite songs of all time. Seeing them play this live was a dream come true. 
p9808
aVI saw them at Gigantour in 2005 with Dream Theater, Nevermore, and Megadeth. Then later in '08 for Paradise Lost tour. Very excellent, though I didn't get to see the Odyssey live.
p9809
aVOh man, I would love to see them and Dream Theater at the same show. I bet it was great. I saw SX on the Paradise tour and again with Iced Earth on the Iconoclast tour.

asVLet's talk about live sound
p9821
(lp9822
VThe Contortionist is the headliner, so they got a full sound check.  Revocation is the 2nd band, and probably got a check at least for dave.\u000aFallujah probably didn't have any.\u000a\u000aMetal shows have never had good sound in smaller to medium venues, as most of the buildings are shit and unless the band has their own sound guy there's no guarantee in quality.  As for the bands, it's hard to know how the FOH mix sounds (being on stage changes a lot and wedges/monitors have a different mix than the audience) so it's out of their control.
p9823
aVThis is not entirely true. Yes the headliner gets a full sound check, after that you sorta lost it.\u000a\u000aThe opening band gets a sound check as well, they basically can check from the time the headliner finishes and doors opening. Everyone else just gets a line check before they play.\u000a\u000aI would say the sound difference is probably in relation to a sound guy. The headliner is making the most money and can usually afford to bring someone they trust to get their sound right. Most other bands would just use the sound guy provided by the venue, sometimes they're great and sometimes they couldn't give a fuck less about how you sound.
p9824
aVWell, at least that's my experience playing shows in Central OH, but I guess it's different in some places.
p9825
aVThat's peculiar, I've done shows in Ohio several times as well as numerous other places, and the schedule rarely deviates from the one I mentioned. However, I don't assume to know everything and the people you work with may run shit differently! Cheers.
p9826
aVWell, my band is a psych band so there are some differences in the venues and stuff.
p9827
aVLive sound is a tricky one because there's so many different scenarios and variables to consider. \u000a\u000aOn stage your mix is completely different to what is coming out to the audience. You often have no idea how it sounds from the crowd. Often the person mixing the stage sound (monitors) is different to the guy mixing the crowd sound (front of house or FOH). The performers themselves have very little to do with the FOH sound.\u000a\u000aAs for individual acts; some bands tour with their own FOH engineers and monitor engineers. Some however dont and rely on the FOH engineer of one of the other bands on the bill or the venue's own FOH engineer.\u000a\u000aIn your scenario it's very likely that each band had a different FOH engineer and as such a different level of experience.\u000a\u000aThings to keep in mind about FOH engineers. A bands FOH engineer will know their songs and the sound they want but not the room. Mixing to the room is important. Conversely the venue's FOH will likely not know the bands sound but know how to mix for the room as it is their home field so to speak.\u000a\u000aAnother big thing that has been discussed is soundchecks. Venues are a business and as such any time they're open, even if it's not to the public, costs money. A sound check may take an hour or more. Multiply that by a three band bill and suddenly you've got 3 hours of soundchecks to be doing not including the time it takes to load and unload all the gear from the stage in between. \u000a\u000aVenues don't like that.\u000a\u000aOften the headlining act might get a full sound check where, in the age of digital FOH consoles, the engineer can save a preset of their mix to be loaded up come performance time. However the other bands may only get what I've always known as a 'levels check'. Which is basically setting the gain of each individual instrument/drum in which the FOH will then do a full mix during the first song. Bands hate it but it's a business thing.\u000a\u000aFew other things to consider: \u000a\u000a* The guitar and bass amps on stage produce the sound but its often the microphones and the PA that is what properly amplifies it to the audience. If the bassist has his amp turned up too loud it's very possible that it can drown out the other elements. The FOH engineer can't physically turn down a bass amp that's on stage. \u000a\u000a* Axe FX/Kemper/Line 6 DI vs Real Amps. Not every band can afford/wants one. Sure lots of bands run these digital models through real cabs and a power amp but a lot don't either. Sound on stage often plays a large role on the sound off stage.\u000a\u000a* Musical composition. As with studio recording, a song's composition and arrangement can often be the biggest cause of a shit mix.\u000a\u000a* Triggers vs mics. You touched on this and it's certainly becoming a more prominent thing in live sound. Not only can you trigger kicks but also toms and even snare if you wanted to. A controlled sample is always going to sound more consistent and can make the engineers life a lot easier. But it may not sound as natural as the actual playing. \u000a\u000a* Listening position. The best place to be in a concert when it comes to sound is right at the FOH desk. Not only will you hear exactly what the engineer hears but any decent venue will have placed the FOH console there for a reason. It's often the best place acoustically in the room to listen. The worst place to be for good sound? The moshpit.
p9828
aVSound is beautiful. It's what really makes a show fantastic when used correctly, even if the musicians aren't great. \u000a\u000aIt can also be a hinderance to the show. Some sound guys are of the mindset of, "let's show off my system! Let's show them just how loud this baby can go!" This is uncomfortable for everyone. They are detrimental to the concert. \u000a\u000aThe sound guys who walk in with the mindset of, "how can I make this sound amazing? How can I make this show better for everyone?" Those are the guys you want. It makes the experiance about the performers, not the 18 inch subs. \u000a\u000a\u000aWhen I saw periphery in the summer slaughter tour (Worcester, near Boston if you're curious), everybody had the worst sound. Way too fucking loud. I think they even brought their own sound guys. They all had sound checks before the show. There was no excuse, if I was wearing custom -25db flat response earplugs and it was still too loud, just turn it down. So sad to have to leave early from a show like that. AAL show in Pittsburgh was the same way. Sound guy never turning down. 
p9829
aVIt's a pet hate of my own. I hate when I'm watching a gig and the sound guy is there watching the same show as me, and its so blatantly obvious that an instrument isn't coming out in the mix, and they don't do jack shit. I saw Alcest support Opeth back in November and I was pretty excited to see them, but you might as well have been listening to an instrumental band. Not only that but one of the guitars could have done with a bit of turning up as well. The very same thing happened when Cynic supported Opeth a few more years back. Incredibly underwhelmed. However, this is not an experience limited to Opeth gigs, it happens all of the time regardless of band, genre or venue. I know support bands generally get shafted when it comes to sound-checking before gigs, but when the show is actually going ahead, what is to stop the sound guy from turning up the vocals when you clearly can't hear them? I try to stand pretty central and near the sound guys so I can get the best sound most of the time so its not that I'm standing in a bad place.
p9830
aVJust to throw even more inconsistency into the mix: I saw Fallujah in a shitty warehouse venue about four years ago, right before the Harvest Wombs came out, and they sounded near perfect. I still have dreams about that mix. I saw the Contortionist on the Parallax II tour in a very large venue that's been around for 15+ years and they sounded like a wet fart.  \u000a  \u000aIn my experience, it really comes down to whether they've brought their own sound guy on tour and where you're standing in the venue. 
p9831
aVNot to be a gramps but I can tell you when I saw contortionist open for periphery they completely pwned them simply by avoiding axe fx. Real amps are still important live.
p9832
aVReal amps are still very important, especially in venues where the PA can't compensate for the lack of speaker cabinets. I see a ton of awesome newer bands jump immediately into amp modeling and play venues where they only mic the kick and vocals- It's an awful combination.

p9873
aVNice work! Also, I must know, what's the sheet music of behind you? Composer? Piece? 
p9874
aVThank you very much! That's the Prelude in D major by Rachmaninoff! Some of the licks in this song were inspired by him so I thought it was only right to have him represented in the video! The music on the wall behind the piano... Not sure what that is. It's kinda just some artwork that was in the room! Thank you for watching I really appreciate it!

p9876
(lp9877
VSlap on your v-neck.\u000a\u000a(I'm sorry.)
p9878
aVI absolutely love this comment lol.
p9879
aVI'd start working on limb independence, helps with those complicated kick/snare/power hand parts with hi-hat chicking. Study the parts that are giving you trouble, listen to the songs over and over to get the patterns in your head, practice over and over, play to clicks, all that good stuff.
p9880
aVBreak the songs into chunks. Maybe 8 bar phrases. Learn it slow, speed it up once you have it 100%. Then start connecting the phrases like legos.\u000a\u000aSince im a guitarist, i dont know which songs are easier. Maybe a drummer on here can tell you their easier songs for drums. Or the drum subreddit?\u000a\u000aGood luck, prog music can be extremely challenging but rewarding! \u000a
p9881
aVDrummer here. Periphery and AAL are pretty advanced shit. OP, You say you've just gotten familiar with double kick? How long have you been drumming? Cause there's a lot more to these songs than the double kick. \u000a\u000aBut to answer the question, I'd work out the share/kick patterns first. Work on keeping a steady pulse over that pattern, or just get familiar with it somehow. Then just piece the rest over top. Like add in the accented hits first, or add everything and work on the accents after. Whatever works for you. Do this for however many chunks of the song you need. \u000a\u000aThere's a great video out there of Matt Halpern describing the 'pulse' and how he plays around with it.  On my phone so can't really search for it, but it shouldn't be hard to find. 
p9882
aVIve been playing for 8 years. Normally when i approach songs it's not as hard so I've tried to challenge myself and am finding it a lot more difficult than usual.
p9883
aVRagnarok is a pretty easy song from Periphery if you wanna start there. \u000a\u000aThis guy has a good cover of it (although it is not quite iddentical to the song).\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pjOMNl91xg
p9884
aVlike maximumrocker said, break it into chunks. watch live performances as well. Drumcams, workshop events, shit like that. Even drum covers that other people have done can help you\u000a\u000agotta soak it all up and hope your legs dont explode
p9885
aVGet some software for phone or ipad that slows down the tracks you're trying to learn.  Create marker points for each section and loop them.  Work on each looping section individually at a very slow speed until you can play the beat then increase the tempo gradually by 3-5bpm only increasing when you have played the part correctly. \u000a\u000aOnce you're done this agonizing task you can try to play the entire piece slowly without loops, slowly increasing the tempo in the same manner.  If you have the ability you can also use the slow down software to help you write out the drum parts on sheet music to make it easier to learn each of the beats.
p9886
aVI just sit down with the song, play the first 10 seconds over about 5-6 times, then try it out until I think I have it, then play it with the first 10 seconds.\u000a\u000aThen I repeat this process for each 10 second chunk of the song.\u000a\u000aIt does take a long time to do but like anything in life the more you practice it the better you get at it.
p9887
aVWhen I'm trying to learn Periphery or Monuments I sit down with VLC and Guitar Pro and tab out the song (there are guitar pro drum tabs out there for older/popular songs, but they generally aren't formatted very well). You can slow the songs down in VLC to figure out the exact parts. \u000a\u000aAfter that, I just practice each riff or section seperately until I have them memorized and can comfortably play them over and over. Then it's just learning the transitions and being able to nail them. All in all, most of the time the songs aren't too difficult to learn, just time consuming. I'd say prepare to spend 2-4 weeks of practicing every day depending on your ability.

aVThat's difficult to think of, but the first ones that come to mind are:\u000a\u000a * [Cynthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWN1TD-etW4) - Traditional and minimalistic progressive metal/rock, lots of focus on atmosphere. Clean voacls.\u000a\u000a * [Solefald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9aSymmizxM) - Avant-garde metal, with a black metal foundation at the start of their career. Just released their 8th album. Mixed vocals, harsh on their first album and usually clean on the rest.\u000a\u000a * [Vulture Industries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acZ_pm7R22Q) - Very theatric progressive metal. Mixed vocals, mostly clean.\u000a\u000a * [Alchemist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrbJkTqXw_k) - Sort of what Pink Floyd would sound like if they played death metal. Mixed vocals, mostly harsh.\u000a\u000a * [Fates Warning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIq33Igj8VI) - Traditional progressive metal. Clean vocals.\u000a\u000a * [Voivod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3uV_ZuPOcw) - Progressive thrash metal. Clean vocals.\u000a\u000a * [Arcturus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTQmWHGNGZM) - Avant-garde black metal, big emphasis on keyboards and theatrics. Mixed vocals.\u000a\u000a * [Gorguts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk7nb-idmdI) - Technical death metal, pushing dissonance in metal to the extreme. Harsh vocals.\u000a\u000a * [Sieges Even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ums7ixW-WLc) - Progressive rock/metal, very atmospheric and introspective. Clean vocals.\u000a\u000a * [Neurosis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omKId6Lhr3A) - Post-metal (or atmospheric sludge metal), the first in their genre. Mixed vocals.

aVOut of curiosity, what would you include if avant-garde metal was on the table?
p9924
aVHmm, these definitely wouldn't all make it, but I love bands like Angizia, Unexpect, Pan-Thy-Monium, Sigh, Diablo Swing Orchestra, Akphaezya, Solefald, Ulver, Dødheimsgard, Vampillia. Now that I think about it, it's probably only Ayreon that would risk getting pushed off the list in favor of Angizia. And I'm also not sure why I didn't put Sleepytime Gorilla Museum in this latter category.

p10018
aVSuper exciting! Would love to see a vinyl perk though!!
p10019
aVI'm fuckin' ready.
p10020
aVAs much as I loved Nostalgia, I am skeptical about giving this band money.  They left fans hanging for nearly two years while on hiatus and now they're asking for $15k?  Producing and distributing an album along with all those perks is no small undertaking. The obvious comparison would be to PTH.  They released 3 albums and logged thousands of hours on the road before going the crowd funding route. By that point they had already earned a lot of credibility with fans and gained a solid understanding of the industry in general.  Corelia has released an EP and played a handful of shows so I'm kind of doubting their reliability. Just my opinion but still excited for some new material regardless.  
p10021
aVThey have the material written though. All that's left is to record it.
p10022
aVFair enough.  But recording the material isn't all there is to fulfilling the pre-orders (unless you buy digital copy only).  
p10023
aVThat's true but I've put in for Indiegogo campaigns before and haven't had a problem and one of the acts was a solo musician without a label behind him. I'm not anticipating any problems with this one although the wait won't be nice!
p10024
aVI agree.  Also am I the ONLY one sitting here noticing that they currently have no bassist?  So like they lost their bassist, never replaced him and decided to record anyway?  Hmm.
p10025
aVNot sure why that is a reason to be skeptical, they didn't ask for money and not deliver during those 2 years.  
p10026
aVYESSSSS I have been waiting so anxiously for this.
p10027

p10037
aVIs anyone surprised at no vinyl option??
p10038
aVYeah, I was really hoping for one, I'll be only going for the lowest reward because of it 
p10039
aVIt's pretty expensive to press vinyl from what I understand (which admittedly, is not all that much). Let them get the record finished, and then let the vinyl wishes come.
p10040
aVthat's why its good to get it done with a preorder like this! If they have 150 available and they all sell then there is no upfront cost
p10041
aVI know, but I'd rather drop 45 on a vinyl set than a t-shirt. Plus I don't even own a CD player.
p10042
aVExactly. I only really buy music on vinyl anymore. The odd digital album or two, but generally I just buy cool vinyl pressings and torrent.
p10043
aVsame here
p10044
aVWas about to say the same thing. I REALLY would love to have this on vinyl. Hopefully they add it later. For now I'll support with a CD package.
p10045
aVGiven where they're at in regards to meeting their funding goal (over 50% before the first day is done), I wouldn't be surprised if they added a vinyl stretch goal.

aVDebut LP. Nostalgia was an EP. 
p10057
aVSo anyone have a good guess as to the time frame the actual album will be released?
p10058
aVWhat's so special about this? Am I missing something?
p10059
aVOh boy the big announcement is that they want you to spend $15,000 for them to record an album!!! Amazing!!!!!! REVOLUTIONARY!!!!
p10060
aVDon't be a dick, recording and production isn't free. If you're going to buy the record anyway, click the first perk and buy it now to support the funding campaign.
p10061
aVYeah, no shit. My band just recorded an EP in our drummer's bedroom on $15,000 worth of gear that we purchased ourselves. Stray from the Path recorded their [last *three* Sumerian releases for $9,500 total](https://www.facebook.com/Strayfromthepath/posts/10152668833922635). If they can successfully crowdfund that much money, then more power to them, but that still doesn't mean that I agree with the concept.
p10062
aVThat's great! Glad you all had the means to purchase $15K worth of gear, for a ~30 minute EP. Let us know when you're recording a 90-minute dual-disc, high production value LP. Chances are the recording equipment is not Corelia's either, sans the instruments anyways.\u000a\u000aI mean, OF COURSE you can record an album for next to nothing, but if you're going for the real deal, then you need money to do so. No need to shit on Corelia for going this route. 
p10063
aVYeah, it is great, because we worked our asses off for all of it alongside going to school, working, and being with our friends and families. You do not need $15,000 to record 90 minutes of professional quality music, especially if you aren't paying for any of the recording equipment. Where and how you spend your money is your prerogative and I'm only offering a different view: I'd much rather spend my money on a band that puts their own earnings into an album before those of their fans.
p10064
aVDude fuck off. No one wants to hear your petty whiny bs. The difference is that Corelia has a large following. You don't. That is why they are going this route for funding. Why would they manually try to earn $15,000 when they have a rabid fanbase willing to fund it?
p10065
aVOoooooooooooo I flinched haha
p10066
aV&gt; If they can successfully crowdfund that much money, then more power to them, but that still doesn't mean that I agree with the concept.\u000a\u000a
p10067
aVWell, I agree with your sentiment. We have heard about how these guys seem to struggle with their work ethic. Regardless of how good Nostalgia is I would like to see them establish themselves, since it's been years since we've really heard anything and its only been the last couple of months that they have turned up. Now they want 15k? Ehhh... 
p10068
aVA single dollar paid by 15,000 fans is nothing for being able to **forever** listen to what is sure to be a masterpiece. I think the fact its a 90 minute double disk is a pretty great announcement.\u000a\u000aHell, even that merch looks sick! If i had money to burn i would totally rock that cloak.
p10069
aVI'm sure it would be good but I'm keeping my expectations in check. Shouldn't be calling something a masterpiece before you even listen to it; that's just rhetoric. 
p10070
aVTrue, but what can i say, I'm excited and expect great things!
p10071
aVI've been where you are right now for many different things. More often then not I've been left burned or unfulfilled. Best-worst case scenario, you delude yourself into thinking a letdown is amazing. \u000a\u000aI try my best to stay off the hype train because then you can see things for what they are and not judge them against made up expectations of what they should be. Feel me?\u000a\u000aIt's good to be excited though!!!
p10072
aVI'm usually the same! I know not to trust the hype train but I also trust my taste in music and I just can't imagine this particular band creating something i won't love.\u000a\u000aBut sure, good advice!

VI know it's a bit of an odd choice for a favorite DT song, but this might be mine.  I can't put a finger on it really, but I think it's a mesh of different reasons.  Nostalgia for one, since this was my first DT album, and the fact that the riff at 5:42 has been one of my favorite things to play for years now.  The piano interlude is really nice; the crazy-unison-keyboard-guitar part at the end that somehow doesn't feel like just wankery and is still awesome... And I think the fact that it's just kinda upbeat and softer on the metal side gives it a wider appeal.  \u000a\u000aIn addition, I think this album was DT's peak, and they've been rolling downhill since (not always far downhill, but downhill).  I could probably fairly say this was their last GREAT album, even if there have been some really good ones since.\u000a\u000a
p10095
aVI think I'm going to have to agree with you, although the fans of DT's heavier side will hate you for leaving songs like As I Am from Train of Thought out of the list. My favourite thing (by far) in this song is Portnoy's playing - although the entire song is fantastic. That 5:42 riff.. daaaamn. 
p10096
aVActually I'd be pretty surprised at someone having As I Am as their favorite DT song, that one's really straightforward and relatively plain.  Is that really a popular one?  I'd be putting my money on things like Metropolis Pt 1, Change of Seasons, Glass Prison, Octavarium, Dance of Eternity, etc etc.  The one's that are more signature DT.
p10097
aVIt was the first song to pop into my mind because I remember a good friend of mine idolising As I Am and Endless Sacrifice. Had to be a song after SDoIT. Speaking of Octavarium: I hated the entire album since I first bought it as a kid back in 2005 'till about a year ago. The song isin't bad at all!
p10098
aVOh yeah Octavarium is actually one of my favorite songs, and some of the others from the album are good, but there's some big weak spots in that album.
p10099
aVI agree that this one is great, but Train of Thought and Octivarium were both pretty great in their own ways.
p10100
aVMy favorite unison section ever!
p10101
aVAbsolutely, it's so glorious. \u000a\u000a6DOIT might be my fav DT album. 
p10102
aVI've said this a number of times recently, but this is probably in my top 5 DT songs. Just so good in every way. It's only behind Learning to Live and a couple of the epics.\u000a\u000aThis is my favorite cd at least from the perspective of Jordan Rudess. Scenes has some great stuff, but I think he shows a bit of restraint throughout this cd, hardly ever over playing, and the keyboard sections in this song are amazing.
p10103
aVNot to say say I dislike lyrics Petrucci writes, I love them, but whenever Labrie writes the lyrics to one of their songs it always stands out so much to me. I love the bridge: \u000a\u000aAnd still life pushes on/With or without you/We've got to carry on/Our will, will guide us to/A place where we belong/\u000aKnow there lies the truth/I am the believer who gives purpose on to you\u000a\u000aAlso, dat unison is insane.
p10104
aVI love James on the chorus of this song. He absolute goes for it.\u000a\u000a6DoIT was my first DT album. &lt;3
p10105
aVThis song has three of the best Synth, Organ and Piano solos of Jordan Rudess.

p10128
aVThis album in particular had some of DT's cringiest lyrics of all time. The music itself though was phenomenal. Count of Tuscanny in particular, my wife and I always turn that song full blast when it comes on and then proceed to laugh about the lyrics.

aVI enjoy The Count of Tuscany's lyrics, but only if I don't take it seriously (which I don't). Quite a few funny lines. The only part I'm really not sure about is towards the end, with the strumming acoustic guitar, because it sounds much more serious and emotional, which the lyrics aren't up to scratch for.
p10133
aVYour wife is a DT fan? She's definitely a keeper.\u000a\u000aOh, wait... 
p10134
aVBeen to the last two Dream Theater concerts with me. Her favorite band is actually Redemption. I have her listening to Porcupine Tree and Sky Harbor now too. Not bad considering she had never heard of progressive rock past Rush when we met.

p10137
aVWorst lyrics of any DT song.  Instrumentals are pretty decent though.
p10138
aVThis song to me was Dream Theater at Peak Portnoy. I thought the lyrics were his. \u000a\u000aAnd so much of this song were so many things that weren't Dream Theater. 
p10139
aVMain riff is very reminiscent of Steel Panther's "death to all butt metal"
p10140
aVThe music on this album is some of my favorite DT has, but the lyrics definitely aren't of the same quality unfortunately. They can write great lyrics when they want (like on I&amp;W and ADTOE), so I wonder why these were so blunt and cheesy

Strangely enough it didn't register as a repost.\u000aSam (lead guitarist and main songwriter) is an old music student of mine (no, I did not teach him guitar - he was already bullshit good when I taught him in high school) so I'd love them to take off. They already have a pretty strong following here in Australia - next stop the US!
p10153
aVI've been listening to them on repeat for the past month and subscribed to their youtube channel. They just released this video today and will be releasing the rest of their live show over the next few weeks/months while they tour. Really cool of them and I hope you enjoy it! 
p10154
aVI don't think they're doing this for every show. I think you misread their message. \u000a\u000aRegardless, these guys are always flawless live and if you're in Australia you need to catch them on their tour.

Hell, there is even going to be a new Anthropia album.\u000a\u000aSo far Arcane's Known/Learned is the album to beat. The semi-title track Learned is also going to be a strong contender for best song of the year.
p10166
aVIs promise part 2 supposed to be the first song? If not, I think spotify has it all fucked up. I don't even see learned as a track.\u000a\u000aEdit: Spotify mobile did have it fucked up. It had the two albums mixed together. Unfortunately, Learned(The song) isn't available, so that sucks.
p10167
aVYeah, I hate it when Spotify randomly fucks up albums. I went to see Earth earlier today and I wanted to listen to some Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light in preparation but half the album is just gone. I mean, if an entire album isn't there, I get it, you don't have the rights etc. but it's hard to understand why they butcher albums like this.\u000a\u000aAnyways, the song is available [on their Bandcamp](http://arcaneaustralia.bandcamp.com/track/learned).

aVDefinitely BTBAM, Slice The Cake, Ovid's Withering or Uneven Structure as top contenders. More leaning towards Uneven Structure or Ovdi since it'll be hard to top something like BTBAM's Parallax II IMO. \u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, BTBAM are my favorite band and I'm looking forward to their rock opera, but there's more room for disappointment after the last album (which is not saying much)

aVFor me, it'll probably be a toss up between Haken's new record (especially if it ends up sounding anything like Restoration) and Black Plastic Sun by Abigail's Ghost, if it does get dropped this year. My favorite so far has been Arcane's new album. Jim Gray never fails to disappoint.

sVInteresting interview with Devin Townsend about the pop music world
p10182
(lp10183
VSomething I noticed that really stuck out to me is his comments on the "formula" of pop music nowadays.\u000a\u000aI've been noticing this when my wife plays the radio (she listens to pop sometimes), is how fucking similar the chord progressions, tempo, and keys are when you listen to the Hot 100 on any given day. A lot of the intervals of the notes sung for pop choruses resemble each other.\u000a\u000aIt feels like I'm being psychologically raped by whoever is marketing this philosophy of ~~writing~~ *selling* music.
p10184
aV[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlNgYDotMoE) is an example of six pop-country songs played at once.  
p10185
aVHoly shit that's crazy! Also the singer in red (cole something) sounds just like Zeke from Bob's Burgers.
p10186
aVthe crazy thing is that it's still fucking catchy, even at the end when all are playing at once.\u000a\u000aEdit: I'd also love to hear a 5 min guitar solo thrown together from all hit country rock songs of the last 8 years.
p10187
aVIt's really interesting to consider the "progression" of cookie-cutter pop music, too. If you look back, say, 2 years, you'd find a bunch of pop songs that were 3.5-4 minutes of pop music (like basically just singing), but now it's 3-3.5 minutes were 1.5 mins of it *might* be singing and the rest of the interludes are drops. Not even interesting drops. Just a bunch of like 4:4 clap-friendly pieces.  It's boring. \u000a\u000aI'm a big fan of John Legend and Justin Timberlake because they actually sing and write interesting songs. \u000a\u000aI also think it's interesting to see how that even indie/singer-songwriter genres have become the exact same formula for the songs. Most genres have become pretty stagnant. Unfortunately.

aVAxis of Awesome - 4 Chords https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ\u000a\u000a49 chart topper songs using the same chords
p10192
aVAgreed. While they sell music, they simultaneously "buy" attention. With enough money, those songs are everywhere - radio, YouTube, television, movies, etc. Pop music is designed to be catchy to the point of infectious, and placing it on so many outlets spreads it. Like a plague!
p10193
aVThere's a sort of lemming effect in the hot 100 stuff where when one song makes it big, tons of other songs come out that are more like variations of the previous song than actual new music. That's probably where a lot of that "similar intervals" stuff comes from. As far as keys, tempos, and chord progressions go, I think most pop artists just sort of pick standard ones and go from there. It's not necessarily a bad approach if you can build something unique on top of a standard base, the main problem is that most pop artists don't. 
p10194
aVDevin is a cool dude. It's rare to see such a genuine person in the music industry these days.
p10195
aVEvery time I read a devy interview it just sounds like he loves making music but hates everything surrounding that. Seems like it causes him a lot of stress.\u000a\u000aThat's the impression I get, anyway. 
p10196
aVI think a lot of musicians echo that sentiment. They enjoy writing, recording, and playing, but all the other parts must really wear on them. 
p10197
aVA close friend of mine's brother has been trying to break into the country music scene for years. For some time him and his sister sang together till she just couldn't take it any longer, and he went off on his own. But they way he put out his first record was all "business" from what she told me. She told me he had researched everything, and they needed a sad/slow song, a funny song, a pro-america song, a love song, then the rest could be whatever. It was very much a formula. And now, he looks and sounds like every other country artist out there. He is talented, but he's putting his talent and voice in that box to sell a product.
p10198
aVI thought this was extremely interesting, and it certainly seems true. As an outsider, I thought I was stereotyping country music in that it seemed like there were a few song archetypes I heard constantly (i.e., a fun song about trucks and beer; a slow, sad song about an ex).

aVIt's more technical than progressive but these two are always meshed together so I don't think anyone has a problem with it being here.
p10210
aVThe only really difference is the tempo. A progressive riff, played at twice the speed, is almost always going to sound technical. Similarly, you can slow down a technical riff, and it will sound more progressive.\u000a\u000aEither way, Necrophagist should have a home here :)\u000a\u000a
p10211
aV&gt;It's more technical than progressive\u000a\u000aUh, what? "Technical" is a common trait of progressive metal. That's like saying "this is more of a concept album than progressive"...

aVI for one absolutely love the variety and open mindedness found on r/progmetal. It's why this is my favorite subreddit. 
p10249
aVReally? So you're okay with Michael Jackson in /r/prog metal. \u000a\u000aI guess this subreddit is useless anyway, everything good posted here is usually already on /r/djent or /r/deathcore. The rest is 'dance of the elven lords' by 'ilaryien' or some stupid shit like that.

aVHaha what? I didn't say I would be ok with Michael Jackson being posted in this sub, not that I have anything against his music.\u000a\u000aBut some crazy tech death metal with tasty shreds and innovative harmonic lines and bass playing on a Sunday morning? Fuck yes please.

aVOh I love crazy tech death. Don't get me wrong. \u000a\u000aI just don't like that soft crap like dead letter circus.  It's just crappy rock. 
p10252
aVHm. Maybe to your ears. To mine they're a unique take on rock/metal and they're a band helping to progress those genres into new sonic territory. And to me, regardless of where a band falls within the hard/heavy rock/metal mesh of genres, if the music is pushing boundaries then I'm happy to have it here. This sub has been and continues to be a source of constant discovery for me and I don't want that to change. 
p10253
aVUnique take? I've heard it a million times before. It's not unique, and it sure as he'll ain't progressive. 
p10254
aVJust because it's not heavy as fuck doesn't make it not progressive metal.
p10255
aVI didn't say that. I just said that if it's not metal, it doesn't belong on a subreddit about metal. 
p10256
aVNo, but it still needs some aspects of metal to be prog metal. It could be sort of heavy, maybe not heavy at all but intricate. If it's nothing but proggy rock, it belongs on /r/progrockmusic, right? 
p10257
aVI agree with you a bit on DLC, I didn't care for them much. But what do you mean by soft? As in clean vocals? Because Contortionist just released a *very* prog metal album called Language, and it's 95% clean vocals, and it's amazing.\u000a\u000aAfter almost 20 years of listening primarily to harsh vocals, I'm really starting to get tired of it. Unless it's BTBAM, if they recorded someone taking a 45 minute dump I'd probably still buy the album.

aVGuys, I love periphery just as much as the next guy, but can we tone it down a bit in this subreddit? /r/Peripheryband would be the perfect place, I think this sub has kinda had enough Periphery for a bit. Nothing personal, but after the streams got released like 3 songs off of Juggernaut have been posted on their own, along with various discussion threads. Let's not flood the sub with Periphery, there's another subreddit for that.
p10286
aVThe album(s?) just came out, so there's gonna be a lot of talk.  We've made an official post containing the streams, so any songs off the albums after the time of that posting are gonna be removed for the time being.\u000a\u000aThis particular one is unaffected by those rules, but you should notice the Periphery flood to be slowed significantly in the next day or two.\u000a\u000aThis happens any time a big-name band comes out with new stuff, and the rules we have in place help to limit that as much as we can while staying objective and fair.
p10287
aVnothing personal? this time its personal \U0001f609da dum tssssss
p10288
aVGlad someone else agrees. As someone who doesn't like a lot of the bands that this sub seems to jizz over (Periphery, The Contortionist, Corelia, Haken), it can get a bit dull when that's where everyone's attention is going, and any other posts from the day just get shunted to the side a bit.
p10289
aVIt's unfortunate that floods like this happen, and we do what we can within reason (see my other response in this thread).\u000a\u000aThat said, we might need to work in some new rules, especially after seeing the tons of "news" from Corelia the past couple weeks or so that has basically just been a series of small teasers and things like "keep an eye on our facebook page tomorrow."  We don't want this place to turn into just a promotional page for these bands building up their hype.
p10290
aVSeems you're being downvoted by the periphery/Corelia brigade 
p10291
aVOh well.  I don't have anything against those bands (although I don't personally have any interest in them either), they just happened to be the current example of a regular concern.  If a band I actually listened to was spamming teases like that I wouldn't really appreciate that taking up the front page either.
p10292
aVYup, it's a problem with every music subreddit on the site unfortunately.\u000a\u000aIf we're adding new rules to stop everyone flooding, I'd quite like it if there were rules about posting well-known songs during peak times, to try and prevent karma-grabbing. Obviously I don't want any rule quite as flat-out as that, but the karma disparity between posts on here needs some attention I think. Especially when at times the top post has 200+ karma, and the second post has 15-20+ karma. 
p10293
aVThat disparity is just an issue of reddit in general I think though.  A large number of people that are subscribed here probably don't actually visit the subreddit's home page very often.  They see the top one or two links in their main reddit.com page, so those are the ones that get the upvotes from the casual browsers.\u000a\u000aThere's not much we can do to influence voting without being subjective, unfortunately.
p10294
aVFirst time I've ever posted them I actually don't listen to them too much.  But ya there is kind of a glut of them here.  But I guess the nice thing for you is that you can just move on to the next post until you find something you like for now.
p10295
aVLove this vid, don't get me wrong, and I personally have no problem with lots of Periphery related posts, but I could understand how other people who may not like them as  much might not appreciate it that much. 
p10296
aVThis is so much better than the original. Obviously Periphery should fire Spencer and hire Katy Perry.
p10297
aVYes please. Would listen to that.

aVdid you hear his falsetto on stranger things? i couldve swarn his inspiration was katy perry.theres alot of katy perry periphery compilations on youtube. maybe spencer took it as constructive criticism
p10299
aVThis uh doesn't quite work...\u000a\u000aI'm all for this sort of thing but the chords don't line up. 
p10300
aVYou have a bad ear...\u000a\u000aOr you're just spouting shit without knowing what you're talking about. The *melody* (what do you mean by chords lining up?) harmonizes well within the context of periphery's chord progression.\u000a\u000aI think where you're going wrong is in wanting the song to have the same feel as Periphery's version. The melody obviously doesn't create the same context/emotions with periphery's chords *because it's not the same melody*. But as for everything being in key and harmonizing well? It actually works quite well because it creates a vastly different feeling than Periphery's version and even sounds a bit haunting at times without there being any over-bearing moments of dissonance.
p10301
aVThe voicings for the melody are strange and don't follow the thirds of the chord progression, like many will.   Also I'm certain that the Perry track is very slightly sharp.  \u000a  \u000aIt works well enough, I think the chorus loses the most. 
p10302
aV&gt; The voicings for the melody are strange and don't follow the thirds of the chord progression, like many will.\u000a\u000aI'm fairly certain melodies don't have to follow thirds. This isn't the 16th century.\u000a\u000a&gt;Also I'm certain that the Perry track is very slightly sharp.\u000a\u000aThis actually suits the track really well. It's only a recent phenomenon that singers are engineered to be SO on point with their singing (if you think Sotello isn't getting a slight autotune in the mixing think again). Many singers over the last century were slightly sharp/slightly flat on purpose because it created a unique vibe.\u000a\u000aThe whole effect is to make the song rather haunting and tense. And in my opinion *more* metal than the original. Christ almighty when did metal become so *clean*?\u000a\u000aI mean, are you really upset that the song breaks a few rules? Because rule-breaking in music makes the best kind of music.\u000a\u000aI think I should add that if music didn't break a few rules every decade or so there would be no metal, much less periphery, and forget about periphery's jazzy moments.
p10303
aVNo, I'm not upset, I was just pointing out why it seemed off.  \u000a  \u000aI am surprised you're defending it so vigorously, though. Haha.
p10304
aVThere's a big difference in a song "breaking a few rules" and a song breaking the fundamental rules of tonality and good song-writing.  You don't have a melody in major and a progression in Lydian because you are going to have a half step difference between the raised fourth in the accompaniment and the 4th and 5th in the melody.  Dissonances are necessary in music, but they have to be resolved correctly or it will sound like crap.  The issue with this mashup is smashing two things together that do not completely fit.
p10305
aVNo offense man but I actually study music at college and the truth is there simply ARE no rules as you're putting them. You can have a melody in major and a chord progression in lydian easily. You know why? Because the melody becomes lydian by virtue of the context of the chord progression.\u000a\u000aFurthermore you're trying to argue that it sounds like crap because of "too many dissonances" to which I reply that you need to listen to more metal beyond periphery. This sort of thing is extremely common in metal. It's *more* common in metal, even, to have shit tons of dissonance at multiple points than it is for things to adhere to rules of harmony. The majority of metal doesn't give a fuck all about resolution or consonance anyway.
p10306
aVDamn I love a good Internet ass beating when someone tries to act like they know what they're talking about and then someone that actually knows what they are talking about comes along and BAM
p10307
aVI guess what bugs me more than anything is that you're trying to apply rules of traditional harmony to metal. It just doesn't work. I couldn't even begin to tell you how much metal is wholly chromatic in nature, totally eschewing diatonicism, yet still sounding melodic.\u000a\u000aBecause the entire point of metal is dissonance. Metal takes ugly and makes it powerful.\u000a\u000a[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjhbTb3k3YE) btw is what I'm talking about. this is an entirely chromatic melody that falls on absolutely no diatonic scale (talking about the intro btw), yet still sounds extremely melodic. I suppose you're going to tell me that it too, does not work according to your "ear".
p10308
aVThis is not a chromatic melody.  It completely falls into a scale with one deviation.  The Ukranian Dorian Scale (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Dorian_scale)\u000a\u000aHere is the sheet music for the intro\u000ahttp://www.sheetmusicdirect.us/sheetmusic/song/1000149116/insurrection?redirect=1\u000a\u000aThe harmony surrounding it supports the notes of that scale.  Yes it is not a traditional mode, but it very much has rules.  And yes there are dissonances in your LoG example.\u000a\u000aThe difference is that dissonances have to be approached and resolved in a way that works with the music around it.  If you look at the sheet music link I posted, I'll point out two examples of dissonances being resolved effectively.  The first note in the melody is a minor 2nd from the tonic of the intro chord, but it resolves in the melody to the tonic.  This is a suspension, very similar to every suspension ever written going back to Bach chorales.  You'll also see that they change chords on the fourth beat of measure 2 (from D5 to C5), this is to resolve the M2 between the melody and the chords.  Lamb of God follows rules governing how to properly resolve a dissonance.  They do it very well in fact.\u000a\u000aThe problem with the Periphery/Perry video is that the dissonances are not treated and resolved effectively which gives a displeasing sound to the ear.  \u000a\u000aMetal musicians DO give a fuck about rules of dissonance and consonance, some of them probably just don't know it.  All musicians grow up with a harmonic language in their head and it affects how they play and how they write.  Metal musicians may use more dissonances that have a grittier sound (particularly with distorted guitars), but it still fits into traditional harmony.  I bet if you talked to someone like John Petrucci or Tosin Abasi, they would be able to give you a pretty highbrow analysis of how to analyze a piece of their music in terms of metal and music's rules.\u000a\u000aMy biggest argument with your comments is that metal absolutely falls within traditional harmonic language.  Does it sound like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilGthRhwP8\u000a\u000aOr this?\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8496Rk-Kl8\u000a\u000aNo it does not.  Those examples are truly chromatic music.  Metal has harmony, most of it is Western based.  It would not sound good if it deviated too heavily from some of the rules that govern what our ears perceive based on what we have heard growing up.  It is true that many bands push the sonic envelope, but many of them do so in a manner similar to jazz, by adding extended 7ths, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords.  By using more complex forms and time signatures and rhythms.  But underneath all of that there is still a sense of harmony.  True chromaticism was rejected by the masses in the early 20th century as it is not something that our musical minds can latch onto and make sense of.  \u000a\u000aYou can spout bullshit all day about metal being devoid of rules but it is COMPLETELY FALSE.  Drummers play drum fills leading into big section changes.  Most songs will end on the tonic chord.  Most songs will use some sort of mode or scale that can be described and is harmonized effectively.  Singers do not like to sing melodies that make no sense.  I guarantee you if Katy Perry was given that Periphery backing track to sing Fireworks over, she would fucking hate it, because the notes she is singing do not make sense in the context of the chords. \u000a\u000aPretty much all of our statements saying metal is outside the realm of traditional harmony is wrong.  It does not totally eschew diatonicism.  There decidedly are rules.  
p10309
aVIf you played the LoG Insurrection intro in numerical order instead of the musical order it's in, you'd have a 6 tone chromatic row. That's far far outside of even an exotic scale like the Ukranian Dorian. It's purely chromatic.\u000a\u000aB is treated as the root in the melodic progression. So let's take B Ukranian Dorian: B-Db-E-F-G-Ab-Bb and compare it to whatever LoG is doing in that intro (for the sake of simplicity I've chopped the intro up into a linear scale): B-Db-Eb-E-F-Gb-G-Ab.\u000a\u000aSo we've actually got two deviations, not just one. A chromatic addition of an Eb and a Gb. One chromatic addition and you can call it a bebop scale or a scale with a blue note. However you want to slice your pie. Two and it's just chromatic.\u000a\u000a&gt;The difference is that dissonances have to be approached and resolved in a way that works with the music around it. If you look at the sheet music link I posted, I'll point out two examples of dissonances being resolved effectively. \u000a\u000aDissonances don't have to be anything. It's like telling a painter that if he uses teal he MUST use orange. He doesn't have to use shit. He's free to utilize the tools at his disposal to create art how he sees fit and if that means a fuck ton of unresolved dissonance (which metal is chock full of btw) that's how he does it.\u000a\u000a&gt;The problem with the Periphery/Perry video is that the dissonances are not treated and resolved effectively which gives a displeasing sound to the ear.\u000a\u000aIn your opinion. And you're a minority.\u000a\u000a&gt;Metal musicians DO give a fuck about rules of dissonance and consonance, some of them probably just don't know it. All musicians grow up with a harmonic language in their head and it affects how they play and how they write. Metal musicians may use more dissonances that have a grittier sound (particularly with distorted guitars), but it still fits into traditional harmony.\u000a\u000aTell that to the guys responsible for the bulk of death metal.\u000a\u000aEven great gobs of metalcore which usually sticks to Aeolian and Harmonic minor pretty religiously is full of moments where dissonance goes completely unresolved. This is used very successfully to create tension and leave the listener hanging. \u000a\u000aIn fact, if you take a bunch of bands often accused of being cheesy (think Trivium or Bullet for my Valentine) the common thread is often that these bands are *extremely consonant* to a fault. They spend entirely too much time obeying harmonic rules and the result is often forgettable song-writing.\u000a\u000a&gt;I bet if you talked to someone like John Petrucci or Tosin Abasi, they would be able to give you a pretty highbrow analysis of how to analyze a piece of their music in terms of metal and music's rules.\u000a\u000aRight. But those guys write with music theory firmly in the back of their heads. The majority of metal musicians have a rudimentary theory knowledge at best. Most of them are winging it on instinct, often doing things very very wrong but sounding very very right in the end.\u000a\u000a&gt;No it does not. Those examples are truly chromatic music. Metal has harmony, most of it is Western based. It would not sound good if it deviated too heavily from some of the rules that govern what our ears perceive based on what we have heard growing up.\u000a\u000aDimebag Darrell was infamous for soloing straight tone rows with nothing resembling an actual scale behind what he was playing. There's a huge number of solos of his which pretty much go 5-6-7-8-7-6-5-4-5-so-on-so-forth. He still manages to make it sound great, IMO, though there's more than a few critics who disagree with his method.\u000a\u000aMeshuggah, btw, actually falls pretty in line with traditional chromatic playing. There's nothing resembling harmony or scales behind their music. The only key difference between Meshuggah and Schoenberg in terms of composition is that meshuggah grooves a whole lot harder.\u000a\u000a&gt;Pretty much all of our statements saying metal is outside the realm of traditional harmony is wrong. It does not totally eschew diatonicism.\u000a\u000aThis is the only thing you're right about. Outside of those artists on the very outer edge like the aforementioned Meshuggah or the Dimebag solos most metal typically steps outside of the bounds of harmony briefly. Or they find ways to step outside of harmony while still sounding melodic. The LoG example doesn't work because they're a mere 2 notes away from being in a legitimate scale. It works because they keep the chromatic degrees far enough away from each other that the listener's ear isn't immediately assaulted by the dissonance. There's just enough unexpectation to create tension but it doesn't sound ugly. It's the same idea behind riffing something and then in the next measure taking the whole riff down by a half step. You're stepping outside of the scale you set up with the first part of the riff in order to create tension and eschew expectation but by keeping that outside step in its own measure our ears separate it and forgive it.\u000a\u000aAnd just a personal aside, IMO I vastly prefer what's being done with the KP remix of this song over the original version. I hate how clean and neat Sotello's melodies actually are. It just doesn't sound very metal at the end of the day. I want some fucking tension. I WANT to hear some slightly flat notes. I WANT the fucker to clash with the chords a little bit. Because then it would actually be interesting.
p10310
aVUkranian Dorian in B would be B-C#-D-E#-F#-G#-A-B so the only deviation is the E natural, which is a borrowed tone to outline the A5 power chord.  Why did they do this?  Because using the E# would have sounded really weird in the context of this.  They broke out of the scale to make it more consonant.\u000a\u000aAs to your comment about the painter, it's ok to break rules as long as you have a point to it.  If the painter painted a fruit basket normally, but painted the orange (fruit) teal, he should probably have a good reason for it.  Likewise in music its ok to break rules, but there has to be reasoning.  And usually "it sounds cool" means that it falls into some semblance of sense according to the rules of music, rock, metal, whatever.\u000a\u000aI agree that most metal writers don't have a firm background in theory, but they've grown up listening to whatever they listened to and unless they grew up on Schoenberg, they've heard a musical language with rules.\u000a\u000aThis dude did a good Meshuggah analysis.  http://www.ahk.nl/uploads/tx_ahklichtingen/Master_research_Meshuggah_1377265300.pdf\u000a\u000aOn p 22 he talks about the various sections use of harmony.  You are correct that some of the sections use atonal techniques like bouncing between G Ab, but Riff F is a mixolydian improvisation.  And like you said, Meshuggah is the exception and not the rule.\u000a\u000aI don't honestly listen to much metalcore, I would love to hear examples of what you are talking about.  Most of the death metal I listen to has some harsh timbral sounds as far as the vocals and guitars are concerned but they still have a harmony that makes sense, again I'd love to hear examples of what you are referring to.\u000a\u000aWith Dimebag's soloing, the number example (if they are half-steps, not sure by your notation) you give I can see a pattern that chromatically outlines a m3 from the root (5) to the m3 (8) down to a Do-Ti-Do at the root (5-4-5).  And soloing is kind of a whole other beast anyway...\u000a\u000aEven most "classical music" that is atonal can be argued to have tonal influences.  The reason for this is music has rules like a language, so you can deviate from them.  But you're still going to have to provide some sort of structure to have the listener make sense of it.  And if you have grown up with hearing music and playing music it is going to be difficult to get that out of your ear unless you completely disconnect from the music making like the serialists did.  That's an argument we discussed at length in some of my theory classes in grad school.\u000a\u000aI'm honestly not trying to be a dick I'm trying to show you the error in some of your arguments.  And I would appreciate not being knocked down, as you have no idea what my background is.  I happen to be a composer and have a masters in music, so I know what I'm saying is correct.  And you may disagree with my initial comment which is fine, but your theory is seriously flawed dude.\u000a\u000aWe are both in agreement about Periphery's singer.  I am not a fan of the recent trend of metal singers coming from the pop punk singing school.  Monument is the same way. I'm usually a fan of clean singing, but I'm more on board with an operatic/musical theater style singer like Bruce Dickinson, Devin Townsend, James Labrie, etc.

aVYou're being quite a dick about this. 
p10313
aVDude's pretentious. I don't think it's being a dick to call him out when he's acting like an expert with a mediocre knowledge of the subject matter.\u000a\u000aI mean, you're losing serious credibility when you're criticizing a metal mix for not adhering to strict rules of harmony. May as well call bebop scales wrong because of that one chromatic tone thrown in. You're literally taking what makes a genre of music special in the first place and saying it doesn't work because it doesn't adhere to the rules of *other* genres of music. It makes no sense.
p10314
aVLook, all I'm saying is that you seem pretty unnecessarily worked up. I don't know who's correct in regards to the theory, and quite honestly I don't care. You're just coming off as really rude. 
p10315
aVOkay.
p10316
aVI mean my whole point, and what I'm trying to get him to understand, is that it doesn't matter fuck all if the 4th scale degree in the chords is somehow clashing with the 5th in the melody (and honestly I'm not hearing it so I think he's just throwing a hypothetical out there without actually analyzing the melody) *if it fucking works*. And the consensus in this thread is THAT IT DOES.\u000a\u000aSo many advancements in music in the 20-21st century have been made by doing things wrong and throwing harmony out the window. Periphery owes a lot of its existence to jazz which throws in clashing dissonant notes like bird seed in the park.\u000a\u000aFurthermore the part he's criticizing most (the extended chords in the chorus clashing with the melody in the chorus) *is literally the part that works best*. Then he just throws around terms like Lydian with his knowledge of those terms being limited to the google search he did literally five minutes before-hand.

My wife who has not studied music was able to hear how discordant this sounds.  \u000a\u000aThe melody has too many dissonances with the chord progression.  Katy Perry's melody was written for a very simple progression with only triads and contains only the notes of the original key.  Periphery's progression that accompanies Katy is not just simple triads several have added sevenths or other non chord tones. Giving it more of a listen and doing some research, I think Periphery's progression is in Lydian which would make the key of the accompaniment different than the melody (which is in major). Thus there are several notes that clash with Katy's melody.\u000a\u000aThe melody lines up fine enough in that Periphery's basic chord progression matches Katy's original, but those non chord tones that are involved in Periphery's riffs don't stick completely to the basic triad harmony that is in the original which what caused my original comment.\u000a\u000aI suppose you could say it has a haunting sound, but I think the dissonances are too frequent and too intense for me to give this a thumbs up.\u000a\u000aAll this said, I love the underlying riffs and I like the original song.  They are much more exciting musically than the accompaniment to Fireworks.  Metal has a much richer harmonic language than pop music ever will and this is a good example of why smashing the two together will not often yield good results
p10319
aVI'm pretty sure they do. Don't know how to express this since my english isn't that good but I just think since there are additional notes to the original song by Periphery they just don't form like the same line, the same melody in your head. But everything that is layed over the original track lines up as far as I can tell. It just doesn't really work like most other mashup-songs.

asVHey does anyone know what the periphery trilogy is about (referring to periphery the songs "muramasa, ragnarok and masamune")?
p10322
(lp10323
VWell, Muramasa and Masamune are both legendary Japanese swords which appear often in Final Fantasy, which I know at least a few of the Periphery guys love. Ragnarok also appears as a end-game weapon occasionally and is of course, the norse end of the world, a theme which runs through the trilogy and is one of the main focus points. My interpretation applies the lyrics to the real world, then delves into the idea of the universe and shared consciousness. \u000a\u000aIt has lots of similarities with FF-XIII-2, such as the last man, the universes demise, although I doubt that particular FF game was an inspiration. If any game was inspiration it would be FF7, which could make Ragnarok and possibly Masamune the end of the game told from Sephiroth's POV. Its most likely FF7 related or just a fantasy story with none of the parallels to our world, or any conclusions I've made, intended. That said, lyrics can have many interpretations so lets do this!\u000a\u000a**Muramasa**\u000a\u000a&gt; *Somewhere in time, we welcomed in the fall. \u000aBut in the distance we can see, shining clear, our demise to be.*\u000a\u000aSomewhere implies it doesn't matter *when* the world ends or which was the last fall we welcomed before it ended, only that it will end and we can see that *shining clear* even now. Also alludes to time being a man made concept which the universe (ie: we) would view as meaningless. This is repeated in all 3 songs.\u000a\u000aThe rest could be making a remark about current world issues and how the state of the world is seemingly getting worse, but we are only getting better at pretending everything is fine. Inequality, Global Warming *(Wake up! The water is rising now)*, Political Corruption, Corporate Power, Censorship ect\u000a\u000a&gt; *You ask these questions in subconsciousness, but still we choose to deny the flood surrounding nations.*\u000a\u000aThis line points out that humanity already knows what should and can be done to prevent all these issues from worsening and yet still can't organise and make it happen. So we ignore the problem and just continue as normal. Vote in the next idiot. \u000a\u000a*"We're not listening to ourselves."*\u000a\u000aThe flood metaphor also implies isolation between nations and between us all.\u000a\u000a&gt; *We are the universe inside of you waiting patiently.*\u000a\u000aThis awesome line hints towards the idea of a collective consciousness, the idea that we all the same consciousness experiencing life through different perspectives. I have a body, but i am not my body, so what am i? Could my "I" be the same as your "I", only we are currently different people with different believes because of our experiences and environment? All things are made from the same fundamental building blocks that create matter and energy, after all. This higher power could be considered a concept of "God" which might explain the religious imagery used in both Ragnarok and Masamune.\u000a\u000a&gt; They will not live to see the day.\u000a\u000aPoliticians? They don't care about what happens to the planet because of their actions, they will be dead before it affects them. This could apply to anyone being an asshole on a global scale. Or maybe humanity as a whole, suggesting we will never come together as a people while we are alive.\u000a\u000a**Ragnarok**\u000a\u000aFirst thing to point out is that the perspective has now changed from "We" to "I". The "We" from the previous song is the incomplete universal consciousness awaiting after death.\u000a\u000aMy idea is that the "I" from this song is the subconscious of what remains of humanity, or at least one person/aspect from it. This is the interpretation I'm going to go with, partly because the other song slightly supports this idea *("You ask these questions in subconsciousness")* but mostly because the other ones (man going crazy at end of world) is already well known amongst Periphery fans so i would rather explore other possibilities.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Bloodshed on my mind.*\u000a\u000aWhat remains of humanity (including the speaker) have become barbaric and violent at the worlds/universes coming collapse, which "I" sees through his bodies eyes. This could also refer to how the subconsciousness is anticipating death and thus, its own freedom.  \u000a\u000aConcerning whether it is the earth or the universe dying (and how the last human is even alive at the end of the universe), my idea is that with no humans alive to perceive time as moving forward, the universes collapse could in a quantum-physics/schrodinger's cat kind of way happen immediately after the last human dies.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Set me free* \u000a\u000aFairly obvious, the consciousness wants to be fully released from the physical realm and our human bodies.\u000a\u000a&gt; *A slave to these walls.* \u000a\u000aThe walls meaning the mind, which literally makes these fragments of a greater consciousness its slave by controlling thought.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Forty days and nights I've spent alone.\u000aThe shadow hungry angel inside of me grows cold.*\u000a\u000aReligious imagery. \u000aShadow = Death\u000aAngel = Consciousness\u000a\u000aIt wants release from life.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Grant a pardon for the meddling soul.*\u000a\u000aAsking for forgiveness for the actions of humanity that've lead to the doomed state of the world, for which he feels guilty.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Death has made its abode on my shoulders.\u000aIt clings to the palm of my hand eternally.\u000aWithin ascendance I shall relive the slaughtering.\u000aYou'll sing to the dirt, praying for the break of dawn.*\u000a\u000aHumanity has a long history of death, which weighs heavily on us. We carry death's abode/home, which implies safety and comfort. Death is comfortable around humanity. Implying our destiny of death isn't a bad thing. \u000aWe shall ascend, but then also relive our gruesome history, the entirety of every single persons life simultaneously and/or eternally. "You" is the rest of humanity who are still yet to ascend, suffering on earth. The break of dawn is most likely the end of the world (since the fall and midnight are both before the end and the end is shining bright)\u000a\u000a&gt; *Night will bring the presence of a ravenous demon setting out to terrify.*\u000a\u000aThe end of the world will create people who do horrific things.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Scale the insight, for the day it lies before us.\u000aSomewhere in time...*\u000a\u000aInsight into the universe scales with your ability to experience it. What lies before us is universal knowledge, including the collective understanding and ability to save the world which we have nearly destroyed. But in scale of the universe, those problems were insignificant.\u000a\u000a**Masamune**\u000a\u000a&gt; *As I slip away... thoughts rushing through me. Angelic call?\u000aOr a demon that's calling my name?*\u000a\u000aFinally, the mind is letting go of the body. More religious imagery.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Enter the intrepid state. Enter beyond what is seen to the spiritual stream of the vacant.*\u000a\u000aFearless as we are now one with the universe and each other. Thus "I" being used again, because we are for the first time since humanity began, one single entity.\u000a\u000a&gt; *The course of ancient power, it will follow.\u000aFall with me.*\u000a\u000aThis could be referring to the fall that is welcomed in muramasa, meaning the fall that is welcomed when humanity dies (ie: falls) and becomes one.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Dark and grim for a memory.\u000aMeasuring all the glory as it seemed.\u000aWas it enough for eternity?*\u000a\u000aThis is us looking back at our past, wondering if it was worth it to transcend and become whatever ethereal being we are now.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Foolish schemes for a destiny lined with dreams all came crashing down on me.\u000aWhat will become of the energy?*\u000a\u000aContemplating how we foolish humans were planning their future with dreams, not realising the eternal "life" that awaits when everyone is dead. It also adds to the scale the insight line from before and how small our human problems were. We are now the energy, universal and self conscious wondering what is next in store.\u000a\u000a&gt; *Salvation is so far from unholy realms of the filth infestation.\u000aTorture the life death-bound in wretched ways.\u000aRepent or revenge?*\u000a\u000aHumanity was the filth infestation, which has now become Salvation. Yet seeing all the injustice throughout humanities short history, it collectively wonders whether it deserves repentance or revenge against it for inflicting so much suffering.\u000a\u000a&gt; *There's no pardon for a meddling soul.\u000aSomewhere in time we welcomed in the fall, now in the distance I can see shining, clear, our demise to be...\u000aWe're not listening to ourselves.*\u000a\u000aThe song ends where the trilogy began, suggesting this cycle repeats eternally. The soul receives no pardon, meaning it must eventually return to the physical, after the creation of a new universe and suffer once more in the hope that, this time, it will listen to its deep subconscious instincts of one-ness with the universe and after the next ascension, will be able to look back upon its many lives and be proud.\u000a\u000aI'd just like to make it clear that I mostly just pulled this from my ass and i know its very unlikely that this is what the band were thinking when writing these lyrics, but let me know what you think anyway!
p10324
aVI always thought the lyrics had some meaning similar to this, but never put in the effort like you did. Top notch!
p10325
aVThanks!
p10326
aVI'm pretty sure the names of the songs are based off of swords in a final Fantasy game, but I'm not entirely sure, I think the story might have something to do with that, but I've never heard anyone in the band explain it.
p10327
aVThat's the explanation I've heard as well. Seeing as Misha is a pretty big Final Fantasy fan and has done covers of songs from VII in particular, it makes sense.
p10328
aVHi c2! 
p10329
aVis that how Sithu is supposed to be pronounced? oops
p10330
aVI asked myself the same question until I read his ama a while back then saw his use name 
p10331
aVI looked into a little, and there were swordsmiths from Japan named Masamune and Maurmasa. There's a Wikipedia article and some of the legends seem to fit the lyrics of the songs. I think the trilogy could be about one of the swordsmiths (Muramasa) who created "evil" swords that were used to kill innocents and after a while it ended up haunting him, it could be about his struggle with his guilty conscious.
p10332
aVName of swords in Chrono trigger also!
p10333
aVIt's almost like Hironobu Sakaguchi *et. al.* worked on both games!
p10334
aVThis is exactly why I dislike Periphery. All the cheesy 'hey guise look we are referencing cool vidya xD' titles and funny incorrect grammar like Make Total Destroy, ugh. \u000a\u000aIt's even worse to see when people expect a band like this to have at least SOME meaningful lyrics and themes, and they find out it's just a bunch of hollow cool words. \u000a\u000aThe songwriting is good, the guitar work is absolutelu stellar, and the way the songs are mixed is masterful, I just can't take my self seriously by listening to a band that does these kinds of things. I listened to the first album a lot, but they lost me after I saw the video for Scarlet, my god.
p10335
aVThey do have meaningful lyrics and themes though. Have you listened to Mile Zero? 
p10336
aVIt's not even just Mile Zero. The songs being discussed have some meaningful lyrics. 
p10337
aVYeah, god forbid prog metal bands write about anything other than overly serious subject matter. What's so wrong about the guys having fun with their work? If the music itself is good, the music videos and song titles shouldn't matter.
p10338
aVBands writing about less serious things is not what the comment was about, though. Protest the Hero is absolutely goofy in their music but it feels a little more part of their own character instead of this put-up persona. There's just something about putting item names of a game in your title that feels a little more cringy than anything else I have seen in progbands. Again, this is part of personal taste, and apparently most are completely fine with it. I just brought it up because the question in the thread perfectly illustrates people expecting a certain level of content in these things like titles and lyrics, and Periphery not always meeting this expectation. 
p10339
aVFair enough. I can kind of see where you're coming from. Sorry for coming on as strong as I did mate!
p10340
aVYes everyone should be 100% serious all of the time. Fuck people who like to have fun and make jokes.
p10341
aVWas that a joke? That sounds like sarcasm! Fuck you buddy!
p10342
aVI for one don't mind their lyrics. Also, their new album, Juggernaught, is going to be a lot more concept-driven.
p10343
aVYou're getting flak for this (and I will too), but I'm on your side. How you present the music is part of the music itself. Bands that don't present themselves seriously \u2013 especially when they might actually be talented musicians \u2013 do themselves and their fans a serious disservice. \u000a\u000aNote I don't mean you can never have any fun. I mean Mastodon's an example of a band who've pretty well balanced goofy craziness with talented execution. But the tidal wave of silliness that came in with 2000s metalcore and djent is too far. 
p10344
aVI knew people would disagree, people have their own tastes of course, but I felt this scenario of someone asking a question with an expectancy of at least a little depth perfectly described what made me not like Periphery as much. It's okay for people to disagree, but this just illustrated it well dor me. \u000a\u000aIt's not meant as a vitriolic fuck-you to the band or whatever, I just hope that the people who downvote at least understand my problem with Periphery and their music.

aVYou missed the part where you *tips fedora*.
p10347
aVI've personally always thought about these songs as a journey for a person trying to fix something wrong that has happened in the world. Think of a typical JRPG plot like a Final Fantasy game. The songs were most likely named after Final Fantasy swords for a reason!\u000a\u000aThe biggest lyrical motif is...\u000a\u000a*Somewhere in time, we welcomed in the fall. \u000aBut in the distance we can see shining clear our demise to be. \u000aWe're not listening to ourselves.*\u000a\u000aI've interpreted this as humanity not changing/adjusting to something that inevitably will bring all of humankind down. This is most likely some sort of demon invasion as hinted at throughout Ranganok. Of course... it seems our main character ends up failing in his task as that there is "no pardon for a meddling soul". The big change in the main lyrical motif happens at the end of Masamune.\u000a\u000a*Somewhere in time we welcomed in the fall, \u000aNow in the distance I can see shining clear our demise to be.\u000aWe're not listening to ourselves.*\u000a\u000aThe change to the words "Now" and "I" is significant. Whatever needed to change in the world didn't end up happening. The end of humanity has come. The main character is the only person left alive and is looking at the face of destruction, sword in hand. Commence heavy crazy riffage as the end comes.

(lp10350
VA lot of Prog Metal these days seems to be a contest of "Who can incorporate the most jazz into their sound". Eventually these Prog Metal bands will just be Jazz bands haha. Not that I'm complaining, love me some jazz.
p10351
aVIn my opinion, a lot of the prog metal is just the modern jazz fusion with basis more in rock music, or the mature metal of today. 
p10352
aVThat would be true if Jazz Fusion was much less common these days, but Prog Metal should still be able to cite metal as an influence. Bands like CHON are great, but it's more Jazz than metal.
p10353
aVI do know what you mean, but for anyone outside of metal, it still sounds like metal. It's hard to explain, but it's like someone just stating something is jazz. Well is it bop, big band, dixie, hardbop etc. they're all vastly different, but the outsider will call it all jazz. 
p10354
aVI think a lot of people that enjoy progressive metal can take a look at the artistry and complexity involved in bands like CHON that are more jazz than metal and draw very close parallels.  Doesn't help that bands like (dont shoot me, just off the top of my head) AAL do a pretty good job of getting the really heavy and the pretty jazzy in their albums.
p10355
aVI'm kinda getting tired of. AAL was my first taste of it, some I guess some of BTBAM's stuff. Then I got into Ever Forthright and liked it at first. Same with Octopus. I was cool for a while, then I just started to skip the super jazzy songs.
p10356
aVEver Forthright kid of overdid it, I think.\u000a\u000aHowever, whatever this kid is doing is unlike other stuff I've heard, and if I'm not listening to prog/progmetal, I'm listening to jazz. He does some weird shit.
p10357
aVJazz isn't for everyone, and I'm not sure it should be what Prog is about, considering Jazz isn't inherently progressive. Still, sometimes a big fucking splash of Jazz in a metal song can be fantastic.
p10358
aVAgreed. I just think I've been oversaturated too much for my taste. I still love it. Mestis is probably my favorite instrumental act out now, but that's more latin fusion than jazz at most parts. Also, it's not really metal.
p10359
aVI love stuff like this, like Plini, Plini is fucking awesome. And as a guitarist this stuff is just so much fun to play. I mean, I love melodeath but playing it's not nearly as fun as playing a Chon song.
p10360
aVThat is some very nice phrasing and right-hand technique. Sound pretty good, too. Also.. the view is stunning.

aV&gt; Kinda sounds like David Maxim Micic\u000a\u000aMy thought too
p10366
aVWow very cool stuff.

aVHaven't heard this guy before. Very well rounded musician and plenty of groove. Thanks for sharing
p10368
aVOMFG
p10369
aVI really like all his stuff! Definitely looking forward to the EP
p10370
aVHe's much more talented than I'll ever be but I miss the appeal of it. Just isn't for me. I think I might like it better if it didn't sound so digital. Either way, he can play. Mean. I hope he goes somewhere big in life. 
p10371
aVI definitely wouldn't call this unreal. Sounds cool but the production is very underwhelming and the thumping should have been left out- Reminds me of local metalcore bands who just learned to sweep for the first time. The chord choices are all fantastic, though.
p10372
aVwow and he plays drums I hate this guy. 
p10373
aVThe only difference between him and you is the amount of work he's willing to put in ;)
p10374
aVI would disagree with that. While there is some truth to what you're saying (that without discipline, none of that would be possible), I think some people just "get it." You can practice technical skills all day, and know theory inside and out, but in my opinion its that little bit of magic inside certain individuals that makes the theory/technical skills truly come alive. I dunno, just my two cents.
p10375
aVIt seems to me that all of the really amazing guitarists have one thing in common. They practice all day, every day. They live, eat, and breathe their instrument.\u000a\u000aI've yet to see someone with that amount of passion for what they do that doesn't also have the creative spark to go with it. The hard work is what makes it possible to find the spark inside of you, everyone has it, but not everyone is willing to push through the uncomfortable bullshit that comes before finding it.
p10376
aVOr, it could be that the reason you still have yet to see someone with that amount of passion yet doesn't have the creative spark is because those people are all just still practicing in their basement and no one is recommending their youtube videos.
p10377
aVThe creative spark will come after time.\u000aAfter years of consistent playing, the dots start to connect themselves. As well as listening to a wide range of music exposing yourself to new ideas.
p10378
aVYeah I have no doubt he works hard but he definitely has a knack for music more than other people. Otherwise he'd be nothing special. Really looking forward to hearing more of his music.
p10379
aVdefinitely, he's really talented.

aV[deleted]
p10381
aVEh.\u000a\u000aSurely I'm not the only one who finds this stuff to be absolutely unbearable? And it's not because I don't like jazz, I love jazz, when it's a sax or a trumpet over piano and drums, but just playing jazzy chords at random times with no feel for melody just seems like showing off. Maybe it's just the guitar tone though\u000a\u000aIt's better than djent though, thank god that fad's gone.
p10382
aVpretty sure he's not playing them at 'random' times.  
p10383
aVI kind of agree. He sounds like a derivation of Animals as Leaders, which are highly hit or miss for me. I don't like the overly quantised djent sound that this kid and AAL have. \u000a\u000a\u000aI don't find it unbearable though, it just doesn't excite me in the slightest. 
p10384
aVDjent gone? I mean now that the sound has had a change to merge a bit with progressive metal as a whole (or other various forms of metal), there's certainly less music that solely identifies with 'djent' as it's main genre or characterization, but it's certainly not *gone*.

p10393
aV2112 is one of the greatest albums of all times, and I always make sure I can listen to it from top to bottom. Still, I feel 2112 is more /r/progrockmusic worthy.
p10394
aVIn My opinion , Rush is one of the big influences for Progressive Metal as a whole
p10395
aVOh yeah, Rush is one of the biggest influences for Rock in general! Love those awesome Canadians.

aVIn the Court of the Crimson King

aVParts of King Crimson's Red (1974) could easily be mistaken for doom metal.

aVRed is very metal indeed
p10400
aVDo you consider court of the crimson king metal?
p10401
aV21st century schizoid man? Sure, it's pretty heavy for 1969. The whole album? Not really. 
p10402
aVMost of the album was pretty heavy. Passage to Bangkok, 2112, the twilight zone, the only soft song was tears. And it was 1976 not 1969.\u000a\u000aEdit: WOOPS, thought you were talking about 2112. Sorry mate!
p10403

p10405
aVDays of Future Passed might be first.
p10406
aVVery arguably so.
p10407
aVGreat album but it's not as heavy as 2112. 
p10408
aV21st Century Schizoid Man could be a contender though. 
p10409
aVRed (King Crimson) was 2 years before 2112.  Both Rush and Crimson were pioneers in the genre, so a 2 year head start isn't that important.  Red was the first to get the sound, but 2112 was the first to have a concept and the first to recognize being prog metal.  Both were landmark, but in different ways.
p10410
aVWhenever someone tells me they don't like Rush I ask "Have you never listened to 2112 while high? Its like hearing music for the first time. " \u000aMarijuana goes really well with this album. 
p10411
aVA Passage to Bangkok.
p10412
aVRush in general, really. 
p10413
aVI think Rush's 2112 definitely helped pioneer modern metal. Their scope of influence  is huge. Dream Theater probably stands out the most. But bands like Tesseract and Queensryche sight influence from Rush. Many modern metal players take heed from their musicianship and unconventional arrangements. 
p10414
aVAt first I thought it was strange that Tesseract is mainly inspired by Rush and Pink Floyd, but then it started to make perfect sense.

aVI find this song mediocre(didn't like the vocals) but that 4:10 section and beyond was amazing 
p10433
aVThe whole album is full of sections like that, I really can't recommend it enough. I can see how the vocals could get grating, but I'm a big fan of Geddy Lee so personally I really like them. If you're still on the fence, I'd give [Ride of the Chechen](http://raijumusic.bandcamp.com/track/the-ride-of-the-chechen-2) and [Our Fate Motive](http://raijumusic.bandcamp.com/track/our-fate-motive) a listen, they're 2 parts of one song with loads of interludes and sections, as well as more vocal diversity than the OP.

asVJakub Zytecki - Debut Album Teaser #2
p10487
(lp10488
VMan, I was realizing the other day that it's been quite a bit it seems like since there was actually any brand new writing from him, which is just making me more and more excited for this solo album. I know there's been a couple new-ish demos up on his soundcloud and the other teaser clip, but most of his demos I've heard were originally from 2010 or 11, and a lot of those were reworked for Disperse rather than a ton of completely new ideas for Living Mirrors.\u000a\u000aAnyway, all this to say that I love the snippets I've heard so far of his writing from the past year or 2, his use of pauses and silence is amazing now, all these off-kilter grooves are so alien, yet so tasty.  That video he made a year ago about the strings he uses [has the most ominously grooving first minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9iZljS0QKg) of pretty much anything I can think of.
p10489
aVJakub is a fresh breathe of air in prog metal. I've been waiting for his debut release and finally can see it on the horizon. It feels as if he's going to change the face of prog metal (even if it is in a small way, significant yet). Only other release I'm looking forward to greatly is Tesseract with the reunion of Dan. Anyways, thanks for sharing the video. I can see what you mean about those pauses!

VI saw this band when they opened for Dream Theater, Opeth, and Between the Buried and Me on the Progressive Nation tour back in 2008. I was only 16 at the time and had just started experimenting with prog. Their live performance absolutely blew me away and completely sold me on the genre. From that evening on, prog metal has become an absolutely vital part of my life so I really feel like I owe a lot to them. Much love and highly underrated. 
p10503
aVThat tour was the first time I ever heard them as well. I was really blown away by their set, and they just looked like they were having so much fun.
p10504
aVI saw them during the same tour. They are one of the few bands whose live performance is significantly better than their studio recordings.
p10505
aVI recommend listening to the whole album, it flows so well. It's a whole experience.
p10506
aVThis is probably one of my favorite albums ever. I really like their older album Wake Pig too. So much talent here!\u000a\u000aDude, if you like this band check out Joey Eppard's(the lead guitarist and vocalist) solo album.  It's really good as well.  \u000a\u000aHere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93-XcS7zjz0\u000a\u000aand on his solo album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_IKgh7F_m0
p10507
aVI saw this band in concert with coheed in 2006. I hadn't heard them before but I was instantly sold. I bought Wake Pig, and slowly fell in love with their whole discography. When this album came out I couldn't stop listening to it. One of my highest rated albums. I think if they were picked up by a different label they could be more widely appreciated.
p10508
aVI haven't heard 3 in forever. They had a song on a metal blade records sampler disc I got at the first Mayhem Fest. 
p10509
aVI watched these guys play a show at The Tabernacle I believe, may have been the Alabama Music Box before it closed down. They played with Coheed and The Dear Hunter and it was fantastic. Wonderful band live, I highly recommend seeing their show if the opportunity every arrives.
p10510
aVThese guys are crazy good live. I first discovered them opening for Porcupine Tree back in 2007, and they blew the roof off. Really impressive, and they were touring behind this album at the time and opened with the first 3 songs. I was initially disappointed slightly that the album didn't do the live performance justice, although I loved it as well.\u000a\u000aThey really seemed to have some momentum after this with the Prog Nation tour that I think they really wasted by dropping an album of oddities and re-recordings rather than a new album proper (which eventually came and was really good), and by really keeping most of their touring local to the Woodstock-Hudson area.  I still got to see them at two smaller venues in Philly in 08-09 or so.\u000a\u000aI do recommend checking out their whole catalogue. TEIB is my favorite (all killer, no filler), but their earliest stuff has a much different vibe - less progressive metal, more funky influence.
p10511
aVI have recently gotten into 3 and I am stoked to see it get posted here. I saw this was Josh Eppards brothers band so I checked it out out of curiosity, and now I am hooked. Cool to see them pop up on my front page. 
p10512
aVThey really don't have a bad album (well Summercamp Nightmare wasn't great, but certainly not bad either). Even their debut, though not tacitly prog and certainly not metal at all, is a great, unique record.
p10513
aVNever heard anything quite like this before and im loving it!

p10525
(lp10526
VI like the idea, and yeah, some great playing, but I wish it all blended together a little more smoothly. Each style is mixed really well, but entirely differently, so when the djenty parts enter it's so much louder and dominant, wish the funk was similarly prominent.\u000a\u000aAlso don't know if making one chord diminished in your 4-chord progression and adding some clean lines really counts as 'jazz', but that's opening a whole different can of worms. Overall I enjoyed both the music and the idea of it, think it could certainly develop into something awesome.
p10527
aVIdk I think it was pretty well blended, I think the fact that it was a bit of a harsh "transition" between the styles is what makes it so cool, it is djent after all.
p10528
aVFor sure, abrupt transitions are fine, it's just more of the three levels of volume that make it seem like they don't go together. Cleans=quiet, funk=medium, djent=LOUD.

aVIt's available on Spotify also FYI.\u000a\u000aI think it's interesting, particularly listening to the parts where Mike's voice once was, haering all the subtle guitar riffs we've been missing out on.  \u000a\u000aIt kind of creates a new style in that the usual "guitars as the voice" sounds we're used to hearing in other instrumental albums isn't there.  There's more mellow parts to each song because of it. \u000a\u000aThe other thing I've noticed is that each song follows a more typical vocal style track with clearly defined chorus etc and not much breakout to different styles within a song, again, as we're used to hearing on other instrumental tracks.\u000a\u000aThanks for reading.\u000a\u000a- Captain Obvious\u000a\u000aedit: a words

p10550
aVmy thoughts exactly. Sweep picking over chug patterns with ambient keys. Don't get me wrong, I love BoO, but I don't think any of the guys need their own solo albums except MAYBE Jason Richardson (even though he isn't BoO anymore =\u005c\u005c)
p10551
aVFor some reason I really dig TWDA by BoO, which is essentially sweeps with chugging and ambient keys. This just isn't doing it for me.
p10552
aVyea I like TWDA too, but vocals definitely adds a layer that I think music like this needs. Not to mention not all the leads are super shreddy in TWDA and some are rather melodic or simple. Not to say Lee's album won't have those, but I really think this kind of music needs vocals for me to really be able to jam to it
p10553
aVI thought I was in /r/Metalcore 
p10554
aVAgain, the guitarist they got for The Discovery was the sole reason that album was so great. The composition skills of this band will continue to lack if Lee and company are the sole members writing. The guy can shred, for sure, but his composition is terrible.

aVAnd Omega before it. It's the new Racecar.
p10561
aVOmega was a close 2nd! But that emotion and energy in the last line of Stranger Things just blew me away. Omega as a whole is my favored album of the two.
p10562
aVOh, definitely.
p10563
aVAgreed. That song hits in all the right ways, and Spencer somehow manages to make that last note sound like the end of something huge.
p10564
aVI couldn't agree more.
p10565
aVI've been listening to the two a lot. Omega has my favorite songs overall in the title track and stranger things and hell below but alpha seems to have a better flow to the album. Truly both are masterpieces tho. Periphery has mastered their craft here. \u000a\u000aI keep listening to omega (the song) and I just want to hold the world collective and shout it in their face that THIS is awesome music. But alas no one I know listens to this in Jamaica and I'm sad and lonely :-( lol
p10566
aVFrom the first second you can tell the song is really something special. A song hasn't hooked me like this since Racecar.
p10567
aVLove the whole album aside from Priestess.  Not sure why everyone is getting off to that song so hard.  They seem to think because it is slow and emotional it is totally gr8 and if you don't like it it's just because you want heavy.  But honestly it's just not a very good song.  No cringe worthy moments but still, really boring progression and the song falls very flat and doesn't go anywhere.  It doesn't make sense where it sits on the album and not just because it is a soft song among heavier ones.  The previous song doesn't lead into it in any way and it doesn't go anywhere to connect it to the following song.  Only song on both albums I really don't like in its entirety, and it pretty much is the only reason that Alpha stands out as the better album for me right now.  Pleasantly surprised at how much I like them both as a whole though.
p10568
aVHell Below is probably the most ridiculously heavy song I have ever heard. 
p10569
aVDefinitely the heaviest I've heard from Periphery, that's for damn sure.
p10570
aVI could *feel* Hell Below. Jesus that song didn't let up.
p10571
aVExcept when it busts into a jazzy piano reprise of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Gotta love that these guys never take themselves too seriously.
p10572
aVGlass Cloud's *Perfect War Forever* is also in Drop Db -but this song is mixed far better. So heavy.
p10573
aVDb... as in two and a half steps below standard Meshuggah tuning?
p10574
aVDb is only a half step down from drop D, and only 1.5 full steps down from standard tuning.  I don't know what Meshuggah plays in but that's not that low.  BTBAM plays in C# standard which is the same thing, but all the strings are tuned accordingly.  On a 5 string bass that puts your low string at a very floppy G#
p10575
aVHave you listened to the song? It's the Db *beyond* the one you're talking about.\u000a\u000aEdit: If we're talking standard tuning, this is how far below tuning each band goes -\u000a\u000aBTBAM - 3 semitones down\u000a\u000aPeriphery (7-strings) - 8 semitones down\u000a\u000aMeshuggah - 10 semitones down\u000a\u000aInfant Annihilator - 12 semitones down\u000a\u000aPeriphery (this song) - 15 semitones down
p10576
aVI'd only heard the song once at that point and it just seemed so absurdly low to me it didn't seem reasonable haha.  Must have heavy as shit strings on those shits. My bass is solid wood neck built through and btbam tuning makes me go pretty loose on the lower strings even with pretty tight action
p10577
aVYeah, he's probably on a 6-string bass for this, and I'm sure his bass is a good as money gets.
p10578
aVHe said he recorded it on a 7 string, so I'm betting he used some kind of octave pedal. 
p10579
aV7-string bass?
p10580
aVLol no, guitar
p10581
aVAt first listen I thought I was listening to Meshuggah, and that's not a bad thing at all
p10582
aVI thought you were exaggerating, but holy shit. Born Of Osiris sounds like Katy Perry next to this.
p10583
aVIt reminds me of the band [Emmure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4v5F98dmgA). They used to be OK, nowhere near as good as Periphery, though. 
p10584
aVYeah, I can hear that reminder of Emmure too and I'm probably thinking about it a bit too deeply.  Love the track.  I believe it was Misha who said the song is essentially a parody of itself; a song that wouldn't have worked on a PI or PII without the rest of the concept album / vibe to support it.  This style is reminiscent of Emmure's gimmick that got them huge back in the day.
p10585
aVI hope /u/iambulb has some good health insurance. No way imma be able to fix all these new holes I got on my butt after listening to that. 
p10586
aVHe's the kind of guy who'll still take you out to dinner after a night like that.
p10587
aVIs anybody else totally blown away by Priestess? I don't think I've ever felt such an emotional vibe from periphery in a song on every level from instrumentation, vocals, lyrics, and just the tone of the song. The album obviously has other stand out tracks, but this one takes the cake for me because it just seems so out of left field for them in my opinion.
p10588
aVI think it shows how versatile they are as musicians. To showcase the heaviness of Hell Below, the length and complexity of Omega, the rhythms of Rainbow Gravity, the riffs of A Black Minute and Heavy Heart, and throw in some jazzy interludes along with the acoustic of Priestess. All of this whilst having a story line with cathartic and impressionable moods and themes. That's pretty fucking special. I don't think I can name an artist besides Periphery that can do that.
p10589
aVIt's really cool. I get an Opethy vibe in certain parts for sure. Great track and album.
p10590
aVIt reminded me of skyharbor in parts. I love it.
p10591
aVThe last minute sounded like Opeth to me
p10592
aVNear the end of "Omega" where Spencer repeats the chorus from "Alpha" gives me chills every time.

aVThat chorus revisit is the most well-crafted reprises. It feels so natural with the song. The only problem is after listening to the song Alpha so many times, I've grown accustomed to that weird time signature in the Alpha chorus.
p10594
aVSee, I am used to it on Alpha as well, but I actually prefer the epic scope and sound of that chorus in Omega more. It has a stronger feeling to me. But to each his own, especially when both are fantastic! 
p10595
aVGod damn. Juggernaut will be the album to beat this year.
p10596
aVDat bass tone though. Unreal. \u000a\u000aYou got sand, Nolly. Boy's got sand!
p10597
aVThe bass tone... is like. What I've been looking for in music production my whole life lol... Nolly truly deserves "getgood" status.
p10598
aVNolly Isgood.
p10599
aVNolly GotGood
p10600
aVStraight up; Nolly should produce an After the Burial album.  The lows are so warm and audible throughout this...  Would be a winning combination of band and producer.
p10601
aVOh my god, I seriously cannot think of another producer who would be a better match for them. The production of Wolves Within really hurt that album... which is a shame, because the songs on it are absolutely killer. Just imagining "A Wolf Amongst Ravens" with a more refined sound and audible bass has my ears tingling.
p10602
aVI'd love a reproduced version of that album. I love a lot of the songs but I end up skipping them in my car because they sound like garbage with zero balls.
p10603
aVDoes anybody else cringe when people in this subreddit refer to absolutely anything clean as "jazzy?" I don't know what it is, but it seems like how a 5 year old would describe something.
p10604
aVYou're not jazzed about the jazzy?
p10605
aVPerhaps an issue in other posts, but this album is filled with legit jazz and fusion sections.
p10606
aVI can't remember the entire album right now but which parts are jazz?
p10607
aVThe end of Hell Below and (I think) Rainbow Gravity.  It's not your traditional jazz (Big band, or combo stuff with the big cats), but something more contemporary-influenced, especially in the chord changes
p10608
aVI didn't really hear anything truly "jazzy" in this album for sure.\u000a\u000aExcept for maybe the end of Hell Below.
p10609
aVJazzy for those who havent really heard real jazz. Anyone who falls in the category,  hit me up, we can go to my grandma's house and fire up the jazz mix cds ive made for her.
p10610
aVI'd definitely say that the outro to Hell Below and MX Ultra are very jazz-influenced, though not by traditional jazz, so to speak. Also, the "alphabet"-part in "Omega" - so delicious! 
p10611
aVThe thing I love the most during the song Omega, is the tempo shift during the clean passage at the end of the song.\u000a\u000aSo good.
p10612
aVThey do occasionally get kind of jazz-fusion during the medium gain moments. I wouldn't call it jazz but you can definitely hear the holdsworth influence on mishas playing. The solo in rainbow gravity off of alpha shows it along with guthrie and petrucci influence all melded into a unique amazing style
p10613
aVI think it's fair to say there are true jazz sections.  Not something you'd hear from a Davis album, but maybe something you'd hear in contemporary jazz.
p10614
aVI hear what you're saying for sure. My original comment was aimed more at people who hear a clean section in some dj0nttt and call it jazzy. But to your points, I would still say most of it is not jazz. Maybe the part at the end of hell below, but I'm not sure about anything else. 
p10615
aVFair enough.  Also I was wrong about it being Rainbow Gravity.  Its the end interlude of MK Ultra I was thinking of
p10616
aVNow that I've heard this one in a better sound quality, I have to say the album is a grower, but it grows. I enjoy it and it makes for a nice addition. I don't think Periphery has gone "concept" album only and I struggle to imagine them not making a true P3. 
p10617
aVGood to see I'm not the only "grower".
p10618
aVAnother here. They're my favorite band, and I'm gonna be honest, hearing them at first actually disappointed me. I just thought they were alright, but I gave them more time, and this is probably just as good as P2 for me, personally!
p10619
aVYou seeing them live? I'll be at the Seattle date.
p10620
aVI'm in Atlanta. Saw them last week! They killed it. I see them every time they're in town. 
p10621
aVI'm in Atlanta area, too. They put on a damn good show that night. 
p10622
aVThose last three songs alone make Omega the clear winner amongst the two albums.
p10623
aVI think this one was better than Juggernaut:Alpha. I didn't lose my interest in any of these songs like I did in the album before; shame it was so short though. This album feels and sounds great. Really a great work of prog.
p10624
aVI wish this had been the longer of the two albums. I was satisfied when alpha ended but was dying for more by the end of omega. 
p10625
aVThey are actually both around 40 minutes long. Omega is only 2 minutes shorter than Alpha\u000a\u000a
p10626
aVYes. I couldn't have said this better myself (which is probably why I didn't say it).
p10627
aVThey are actually both around 40 minutes long. Omega is only 2 minutes shorter than Alpha
p10628
aVRight, but I was okay with Alpha ending after 42 minutes (i.e. I liked Omega way better).
p10629
aV&gt; Right, but I was okay with Alpha ending after 42 minutes (i.e. **I liked Omega way better**).\u000a\u000aHaha well thats why! I totally agree with you though. Omega is better than Alpha\u000a
p10630
aVOmega is my favorite song from any of Periphery's albums.\u000a\u000aOmega the album, is my favorite of the two.\u000a\u000aThe songs that really stuck with me: Omega, Priestess, Rainbow Gravity, Hell Below, MK Ultra, Four Lights
p10631
aVWas Omega also your favorite Pokemon remake?
p10632
aVI feel like I'm the only one who noticed the timing of these two releases. \u000aPeriphery III: Hoenn Confirmed.\u000a
p10633
aVThe outro to Hell Below sounds like a character select screen on a Mario Kart game.  And I love that
p10634
aVThis album seems to have more standout songs, more notably the last 2. I wouldn't call the song "Omega" the new Racecar, but something very different entirely.\u000a\u000aNot to mention Stranger Things; such a soulful song. Both songs sound so Periphery yet not at the same time. I feel that Misha has taken on alot of influence from AAL's Tosin Abasi. Some of the chord progressions in these songs feel very jazzy and unexpected from Periphery. Sure, there was always some jazz-fusion solos and passages (see Racecar) but it feels so much more fleshed out now. The outro to Hell Below sounds straight out of The Contortionist.\u000a\u000aSo, having listened entirely to both albums now, I can say with certainty that this is my favorite album from them. Seriously can't wait for my preorder to finally arrive.\u000a\u000a
p10635
aVI actually preferred Omega to Racecar. But, they are both tremendous songs. The jazzy passages are so cool, and it's interesting how they follow some of the heavier songs (MK Ultra and Hell Below). These albums are excellent. 
p10636
aVI didn't mean that one was better than the other. I love Omega, and I'm sure it will take over Racecar as my favorite song of all time soon enough, but it's delightfully different in many ways. \u000a\u000aI agree about the jazzy outros especially, I enjoyed alot of the electronic interludes in P2, but they felt just a tad bit overdone. 
p10637
aVYeah, I think people are just saying it's the new Racecar because they are awesome songs, that are over 10 minutes. Yeah in regards to P2, I liked it in Have a Blast, but they're a bit much over the course of the whole album. Still a great album though.

aVIs no one gonna address Priestess? I'm absolutely in love with that song. 
p10648
aVI liked P2 but I must say Juggernaut is very meh for me, most of the riffs dont sound unique to me and the vocals don't work on any level for me (alpha sounds like..)
p10649
aVGive it time and repeated listens and that opinion may change. As another poster said, this album is a bit of a 'grower'.
p10650
aVDefinitely. First few listens the album was super meh for me. Around 4 or 5 listens I was starting to get into it. \u000a\u000aI'm around 11 or 12 by now and I'm seriously loving these records. Alpha is a little more upbeat than previous Periphery stuff at times, but still has plenty of heavy stuff. It really does grow on you. I'm loving it. \u000a\u000aOmega is even better - And holy balls, Hell Below (Heaviest song ever written I'm sure), into Omega ( :O ) then Strange things is the most kick ass ending to a record ever. Spencer KILLS IT so so hard on Strange Things. This is the best stuff they've ever written.\u000a\u000aPeriphery is love. Periphery is life. ^Now ^if ^only ^the ^Toronto ^Show ^wasn't ^19+ ^so ^I ^could ^go ^:(.\u000a\u000a
p10651
aV&gt; Periphery is love. Periphery is life. Now if only the Toronto Show wasn't 19+ so I could go :(.\u000a\u000aYeah its really weird... Not sure why its 19+ because Periphery played the same venue last year and it was all ages... I've been to like 10 concerts at the Opera House and this is the first 19+ i've seen.\u000a\u000aIf its any consolation, Periphery will probably come back soon (end of 2014) and you should be able to see them then.

aVI think you guys have the wrong attitude. It's like as soon as they found out it wasn't a technical hand demo it doesn't get anybody off anymore. In the same breath worshiping other bands that try to sound identical to a midi file.
p10659
aVnot prog metal. sweep picking and double bass don't mean prog. That being said, i like this album, and even with the whole recording "scandal" they have, Dingir is a good album too. The attitude these guys have are kinda shitty. also, they post a lot of memes and it makes my cringe
p10660
aVIt's one of those Catch 22s where I hate the band but love their music.
p10661
aVas a black metal fan, i understand.
p10662
aVinb4 they don't play their instruments. Dingir and Embryonic Anomaly were were recorded at half speed with a lot of other computer wankery on the side. This I know. This album does have a much rawer non manufactured feel than the previous two. Is it fake? I don't know. Just enjoy the music.
p10663

aVKBtFU felt really half-assed to me. Production-wise, lyrically... and Paul sounds like he's *trying* to sing poorly in parts. If they were going for a more "raw" feel, they succeeded I guess. Just doesn't compare to how tight and cohesive Traced in Air is. KBtFU has its moments for me and Holy Fallout is an incredible song. Overall it just felt lazy compared to Traced in Air. I enjoyed CBA and the direction they took there much better.

aVi don't mind "raw" sounding stuff, but it doesn't really work for cynic.

aVI heard they were something like $100K in debt from the Earth tour.  I'd imagine they need to pay that off before recording new music. \u000a\u000aHell, I was just thrilled that they toured and I got a chance to see them live last summer!  
p10704
aVIf I remember correctly, I think they made 99k of it back.
p10705
aVI hadn't heard that, but it appears that seems to be the case according to [this source at least](http://www.vagrant.com/artists/bio/48-horsetheband). That source also says they got demands for the money from their publishing company immediately upon returning to the states.  That site hasn't been updated in a while though (no bassist is listed in the band lineup).\u000a\u000aPerhaps they're out of the debt hole, but a label won't give them a chance since they have such a bad track record.  Sort of like quitting a tour in the middle of it to go home and write a record about pizza.  Hell, I'm not even sure they're still signed to a label at this point.

p10710
aVOpinions, man. I saw these guys in '06 when they opened for Dragonforce (who I was there to see) and did not care for them one bit.\u000a\u000aThen again my taste was completely different at the time. The Sword was the second opener and I wrote them off as well. They're now one of my favorites and I practically never listen to Dragonforce.
p10711
aV&gt; I practically never listen to Dragonforce.\u000a\u000aAre they still around? What's going on with them? \u000a\u000aUsed to love them for that cheesy quest metal.
p10712
aVFrom what I heard from a friend, their live act could not keep up with their studio quality sound.
p10713
aVFrom what I understand, they had a bad tour that nobody has let them live down. I could be wrong, but I'm under the impression that 'Dragonforce can't play their stuff live!' was circumstantial and has since been blown way out of proportion. 
p10714
aVThat was the tour I saw, and I remember them mentioning equipment/sound issues during the show. It certainly didn't live up to the studio sound, but 14 year old me could not give fewer fucks.
p10715
aVSo did I. Last I heard they were touring with Epica for a new album. ZP left the band a few years ago and they got a new vocalist. Haven't heard any of their material since.
p10716
aVThey're still around.  As the other comments say, they had a terrible headlining tour off their Guitar Hero popularity + Inhuman Rampage.  They were just drunk the whole time and blamed it on the sound.\u000a\u000aAnyways, they faded back to just the power metal scene, ZP Left after Ultra Beatdown, and their new singer came in with The Power Within.  They changed style considerably on that album, keeping the guitar wizardry to ONLY the solos, which are considerably shorter on this album.  It's more a heavy metal record than anything else.\u000a\u000aTheir latest, which came out a few months ago, is a great mixture of the style they were famous for and The Power Within, giving us the guitar insanity of the majority of their work plus shorter and (arguably) more focused songwriting.  Also, more riffs.\u000a\u000aThe cheese never left once.
p10717
aVI saw them at a festival many years ago and they were complete jerks to the crowd. They continually insulted the crowd and acted like they were better than everyone else for their whole set. Sure, there weren't many people there at the moment- and the people who were there were probably saving their energy for the evening where Gwar, Behemoth and In Flames were playing. \u000a\u000aTheir attitude completely turned me off to them, regardless of how good their music might be.
p10718
aVTo be honest, I don't really know what genre/subgenre H the B would belong to.  It's heavy, but it's not always super "metal."  I mean, look at a song like Lord Gold Throneroom, some parts have crazy metal riffs and breakdowns, while others have the listener dancing like it's a disco song.

The 6 Degrees suite is explicitly described multiple times as a single song, broken up into 8 tracks.  To post the full album, he'd have posted the songs on Disc 1 as well.\u000a\u000aAre you confusing the term "album" and "disc?"  Or "song" and "track?"

asVAnother Year - 8bit - Animals as Leaders
p10766
(lp10767
VI love anything 8-bitized.  AAL's is usually a lot of fun.  Scale the Summit got me into this band called The Reign of Kindo who actively 8-bitizes their own music.  Which is loads of fun to listen to.  \u000a\u000aThe solo to Racecar always slays me when you listen to the 8-bit version.  It's out there on youtube.  
p10768
aVIt's interesting how a lot of prog metal fans seem to get into The Reign of Kindo. I discovered them from one of Luke Holland's drum covers.
p10769
aVIt is interesting! I love them too, even though they're not remotely metal and only progressive here and there. Maybe prog metal fans are just more likely to appreciate great songwriting and musicianship even if it doesn't really fit in the genre?
p10770
aVGreat writing, lyrics and musicianship is always appreciated and liked in my book. I like Kendrick Lamar for that reason. Or Ellie Goulding. 
p10771
aVProg music converted to 8 bit makes great video game music, and vice versa 
p10772
aVThis is fantastic! If you're taking requests, Physical Education would be sick.
p10773
aVYES. I love when things like this get made, another way to keep the album fresh in the rotation. The [Tesseract Altered State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1sjo4d1F8w) one is fantastic, I hope they do the rest of JoM!
p10774
aVNice
p10775
aVHow do you make 8 bit stuff?
p10776
aVI think this guy used a Guitar Pro file he found of the song, converted it to MIDI, then used another converter that converts MIDI to 8-bit tracks. That's at least one way to do it.
p10777
aVUsually I make the tabs for it myself, but seeing there was already a perfect one, I decided to just use that one. I also stated that in the video description.
p10778
aVThat's the easiest way to. 
p10779
aVThanks bro
p10780
aVI too, would like to know.
p10781
aVAAL are probably THE most 8bitigenic band out there\u000a\u000aTheir music just translates perfectly to 8bit
p10782
aVSeriously. I had no trouble imagining this playing in the background of an NES game at all. It just fits so perfectly. 
p10783
aVAnd here I am thinking that AAL couldn't be any better. This sounds ridiculously good. 
p10784
aVI love how meta it is that there's an 8 bit version of a reference to a funny video online in this song.\u000a\u000aFor those who don't know, the song has a joke reference to "the lick" when the lead guitar first kicks in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDxhnaKD7Q
p10785
aVThe Lick has been a recognized thing since long before that video, it's a purposefully referential bit of melody in a lot of jazz solos. The recent crossover to its use in progmetal is funny, though! 
p10786
aVWell yeah, I was assuming it was pretty old like that, someone would have HAD to have pointed it out before the dawn of youtube. But it didn't become widespread knowledge before that video :P
p10787
aVAwesome work! This tune in particular was practically composed for an 8-bit remake. Such a strangely upbeat and different sound for AAL, which is why I love it, it's an abrupt island vacation in the middle of dank prog metal grooves.

VCool story: I did a presentation about this song in art history class a few days ago, relating the song and the band to post-modernism and eclectisism in particular (grunge and free jazz were among the influences). I was, to my suprise, able to hold the attention of my class, which consisted mainly of average 17 y/o's. \u000a\u000aIt remained quite interesting to play this song in front of the enite class, from beginning to end, amongst some other DEP song fragments and although they seemed a bit shocked at first, once I started explaining how this sort of music devoloped, they actually seemed quite interested. All around a pretty fun experience :) 
p10882

aVTip of the hat, you've got balls.
p10891
aVYet another funny Dillinger story:\u000a\u000aI used to be in a pop punk band back in 2002.  We opened for Dillinger, haha.  It was a pop punk show - like 5 pop punk bands - and then Dillinger closed the show.  Oddest crowd you have ever seen.  We played right before Dillinger, and when they got on they started by saying something to the effect of "That band sucked, enough pop punk garbage".  My band mates and I were so happy they mentioned us haha.
p10892
aVI don't know if they are any more, but I feel like Dillinger used to be such dicks about bands that don't break the mold. Greg especially. I've read interviews from the early aughts where he shits on bands like Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold for being generic.\u000a\u000aLike, calm down dude, you *just* joined this band. I'm all for idiosyncrasy and artistic integrity, but the elitism is annoying, and shitting on younger bands who are just trying to play their music and have a good time is weak. You don't seem like you're too upset over it, but it irks the shit out of me.
p10893
aVYeah.  Now that I'm older I really frown upon anyone judging anyone else just because of the music they listen to.\u000a\u000aBut as far as Dillinger, I just took it as "part of their image" and brushed it off.  I feel like if a metal band makes fun of a pop band it's just pandering to their fanbase.  Like a metal band is supposed to hate pop bands.  It's a shame that's the way it is.
p10894
aVWord, it's all just a part of the larger metal elitist trend, and I think that judgment is one of the main things alienating any newer would-be fans. Sometimes I feel like a lot of metalheads are *trying* to distance themselves, and it kind of sucks.
p10895
aVIt's ironic that Greg would be a dick about bands not "breaking the mold", when he just formed a supergroup that sounds pretty generic.
p10896
aVRight? Killer be Killed is good, but the only thing they *really* have going for them is star power.
p10897
aVWings of Feather and Wax fucking rocks, but it's so vanilla. It's like anti-Dillinger.
p10898
aVFunny story. When i saw DEP live it was after 7 bands including periphery and animals as leaders. Feel alseep leaning against the wall during their set whike this was blaring and strobe were at full speed.
p10899
aVSummer Slaughter? Haha they were calling us out on not being an active enough crowd, but they played after most of us had been there for 7+ hours. Still such a sweet show.
p10900
aVYep! Summer slaughter. I give them props for those creepy ass gifs on loop on their background screens
p10901
aVThis is one of my very favorite favorite songs from one of my favorite bands.  I always say that I listen to so much metal that I'm pretty much desensitized to it.  It doesn't really hype me up or anything, most metal I treat as casual listening.\u000a\u000aBut this song is the only song I'm aware of that can make me involuntary headbang.  It's one of the most aggressive songs I've ever heard.  Just the way it's mixed and the attitude in the guitar riffs somehow got conveyed through the mic and through the mixing, it's just fucking gnarly.  \u000a\u000aHonorable mention to Bleed by Meshuggah. I know we've all heard it dozens of times, but it's one I think is not overrated.  It's is a titan of groove.

p10907
aVi wasn't there for that, but i'd agree with the point that progressive metal or music in general seems to be more classically structured and the dynamics and weirdness seems to be branched off from classical structure. DEP doesn't fit that description. 
p10908
aVTBH, I also think DEP isn't prog. The reason you're getting downvoted is because you didn't actually try to explain your reasoning, which is actually something a lot of people would've agreed with.
p10909
aVi don't really care about the down voting, but yea that's definitely why. just some useless 2 cents i didn't really think i'd have to dive into. 
p10910
aVEnlighten me, please.
p10911
aVwell, it's obviously just my opinion. But DEP has always been a hardcore band. Very chaotic with poly-rhythms and layering- which i don't think makes a band progressive. Progressive to me is more about melodic elements and that band's sound in a particular time period. I will admit that DEP, ever since Ire Works, has become more dynamic musically, but again i don't think that necessarily makes them progressive metal- or even metal. Wasn't trying to "enlighten" anyone.
p10912
aVNice! I disagree, but it would have been very cool to have your well-stated opinion in your original post. DEP obviously isn't writing 12 minute songs or three part suites in classic prog fashion, but they incorporate so many outside influences and have turned their original metalcore sound on its head in a way that I would consider prog.
p10913
aVAre they mathcore / metalcore?
p10914
aVTDEP is very much a metalcore band. I don't use the term "mathcore" but it usually refers to very technical, chaotic metalcore.
p10915
aVMathcore to me was more about having weird time signatures and the effect it produces 
p10916
aVYea, of course. They were a part of like a second wave of mathcore/math metal in my opinion
p10917
aVWho was in the first wave?
p10918
aVI'd say bands like Botch or Ed Gein 
p10919
aVI'm not sure about Ed Gein but after reading through Wikipedia  Converge, TDEP and Botch all produced a mathcore album within a year of each other.
p10920
aVEd gein was earlier I'm pretty sure, of course I could be wrong again. But then I'm not sure. Although I've heard bands from the 80s who were proto mayhcore in a sense. 
p10921
aVI know you explained yourself elsewhere, but I just wanted to give my two cents. I feel like progressive music itself isn't a clearly delineated genre, more of an avant-garde attitude toward making music, which can exist within any genre. The very nature of prog is always shifting and changing because falling into a pattern and putting limits on the music goes against the very definition of the word "progressive," in my opinion. Dillinger may not be straight metal per se, but they're definitely heavily influenced by metal, especially with their newer stuff, so I think it has a place here.\u000a\u000aAlso, how in the hell are you being downvoted? I don't even have the option to downvote on this sub, lol.
p10922
aVI agree with what you said about the time it came out, which was one of my points. And one of the reasons I don't consider it prog. \u000a\u000aI guess my delivery irked some downvoters

p10931
aVIt probably has more to do with where they're travelling through. Looks like they would be going from Denver to Minneapolis. I believe the fastest route is through Iowa, and Des Moines got over a foot of snow yesterday. I'd bet Nebraska got some too.

p10940
aVI still very much enjoy both, but with his departure I feel we don't have two separate styled bands anymore. We now have two similar sounds instead.\u000a\u000aIt's like BOO took a step back, and CG has a Jason spin on it. It's like they're both on the same level now.
p10941
aVI wish CG would let him loose more. I want more solos like this. 
p10942
aVI was at this demo at namm and he also played a song off the new cg album. The solo section of that seemed faster and much more technical than this actually when I saw it in person but just listening to the album you can't tell.
p10943
aVI sort of agree, I was never really a CG fan. Now that they have Jason though I do find them a bit more interesting, while BOO has sort of lost its appeal to me
p10944
aVJason Richardson and I are actually pretty good friends. We went to same church. He's a really humble and nice guy. It's pretty refreshing because a lot of other people let the fame get to their heads and become assholes.
p10945
aVI met him about three or four years ago and he was easily the biggest prick that I've ever interacted with as a fan of a band. Hopefully he was just having an incredibly shitty day. 
p10946
aVThis is as close to a live version of this song as we're gonna get. And god damn, that last solo...
p10947

p10948
aVWell. I can live my life knowing that I will never be able to shred like Jason Richardson. And he is only like 22!\u000a\u000aFucking ridiculous player. 
p10949
aVHe definitely added a lot to BoO, but I feel like they added a lot to him as well.  For me, his [solo stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL43bgPDTaI)lacks cohesion.\u000a\u000a

p10952
aVwhat a fuckin monster. I remember seeing him post tryout videos for All Shall Perish before he actually got the gig and remember saying to myself: "this kid is gonna shred for the foreseeable future"\u000a\u000athanks for the post, always love seeing stuff like this and he doesn't post a lot of playthrough vids anymore so that was awesome to watch.
p10953
aVI was lucky enough to see BoO live years ago. It's insane how spot on they can be with such technical music. I mean absolutely nothing was out of place. And yeah, this dude is way too good for his own good. 
p10954
aVI'll bet Lee McKinney was sitting in the back thinking "Why the fuck did we ever let him go..."

aVI have a harder time enjoying I, Omega than I should. The music itself is great, but it really feels like the vocalist is going out of his way to sound like Rody. And then they bring in the female vocalist and it all just feels like it was done to have that protest sound.

There's passages (apparently) inspired by Dutch Techno, percussionists from Zanzibar and much more. "Bububu Bad Beuys" is especially odd. World Music isn't just a phrase here.\u000a\u000aIn my opinion the best prog album of the year so far. At the least it's the most original.

VJust though it was cool the methodical way he goes through a bunch of different feels. I know when I feel stuck or like I've run out of ideas when writing (sadly, programming) drum parts, it can be fun to try to find a different beat unit to emphasize, see if it brings out the groove in a better way.
p10985
aVThere's something viscerally satisfying about polyrhythms. Thanks for this
p10986
aVTroy's a beast of a drummer. He does some pretty intense polysomethings in this one - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHb8iZvwJ5w\u000aAs a guitarist I have to say, drummers are the best.
p10987
aVEww that was FRESH. Eric's face at 3:15 is freakin' hilarious!
p10988
aVBreaking this down in my head finally helped me understand polymeter vs. polyrhythm. (I like polymeter better.)
p10989
aVIf I understand correctly, those are polymeters because they're all in 4/4, just not necessarily in some common beat like half note or quarter note. If it was some 5/8 against 4/4 feel then it would be polymeter.\u000a\u000aIf all this is correct then for me polyrhythm is waaaaay more hard to "get" than polymeters. Those come more easily for me
p10990
aVPolyrhythm is such a misnomer in this genre. If you had a 4/4-5/4 polyrhythm, the duration of both would exist in the same measure. They would essentially be at different tempos. This would be hard to make musical and near impossible for one drummer to accomplish.
p10991
aVIt's difficult, but not super impossible. You're absolutely right about the durations of polyrhythms occurring in the same space, I would just veer away from notating it as a 4/4 - 5/4 polyrhythm, since using time signatures implies you're talking about polymeter. Usually for polyrhythm I've seen it as 4:5.\u000a\u000aI'm just expanding further on what you're getting at here, if people are still curious more about the concept. '2 against 3' being the most common polyrhythm, where even eighths occur simultaneously with eighth note triplets, so the first of the even eighths and the first of the triplets would line up every beat. Impressionist piano music for example loves that shit, gives a great fluid texture.\u000a\u000aIn your example, 4 against 5 would be 4 quarter notes (we'll make them quarters for clarity's sake) at the same time as 5 dotted eighth notes. After 4 beats, both cells would be back to their beginning. This isn't particularly difficult for a pianist or drummer or something to accomplish. Granted, it gets much harder quickly as you work with smaller subdivisions, e.g. 4 sixteenths vs. 5 quintuplets is a pain, I just kind of mash 'em together and make sure the beats line up, usually too fast to worry about exact precision, usually just for texture anyway.\u000a\u000a Key idea being that polyrhythms are different subdivisions (creating different speeds for the two cells) that line up on repetition, while polymeters are equal length notes, just varying numbers of notes in the patterns (5/4 and a 4/4) causes desynchronization of starting point.\u000a\u000aEDIT: /u/Something_Unclever is got this shit under control, I just wrote a ton of words to muddy the waters ;) \u000a\u000aCan be frustratingly tricky to describe the difference textually, been thinking of making a video with examples outlining the differences and how to recognize various patterns. Also would want to delve into common compositional methods to truncate or extend patterns to make 'em line up all pretty to 4/4 or whatever (10/4 if you're Ow My Feelings)
p10992
aVNot drumming but still, got some nice 5:3 patterns in there.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCFlVAavwOU
p10993
aVSo then (based on this and /u/Michael_Caine's reply below) I was wrong and/or the video is mislabeled? \u000a\u000aYou're right that it would be difficult for "one drummer" to pull off, but when I think of poly*rhythm* (as you stated it) I think of multiple instruments, say a guitarist and a drummer but the guitar is playing in 4/4 at one tempo and the drums are in 3/4 at another tempo so that the measures sync up. Whereas a poly*meter*, according to your description, would be the guitarist and drummer having equal quarter note length so that three measure of 4/4 for the guitarist syncs with four measures of 3/4 for the drummer. (This would be much easier to pull off on solo drums and is essentially what is being done in the video.)
p10994
aVI usually avoid thinking of polyrhythm as instruments playing in *different* meters and different tempos, it's usually the same meter, just being subdivided in different groupings (e.g. - subdividing into triplets vs. sixteenths), that's why polyrhythm makes sense to use a ratio notation rather than metric. \u000a\u000aPolymeter more has to do with desynchronization caused by different lengths of *phrases*, where a 5-note quarter note pattern will gradually offset if played simultaneously with a 4-note quarter note pattern, even though they have the same individual beat rhythmic values.\u000a\u000aIn the video, the Physical education groove is always 4/4, and technically Troy keeps playing in 4/4, he just changes the subdivision of the cymbal stack hits, which is why they change speeds, so it is indeed polyrhythm.\u000a\u000aLike I had mentioned, super annoying to describe purely verbally. There was a link I've referred to a bunch of times in the past when trying to be clear with writing about it, let me see if I can quick grab it.\u000a\u000aEDIT: [This link has a couple very clear visual examples](http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/10488/polymeter-vs-polyrhythm)

p11011

aVWell you can play it with a 6 string, juste buy an 8 string set and put the 6 lowest strings.

p11026
aVNot sure if you already know this, but thought I may as well mention it just in case; Just beware that your guitar might need adjustments to the truss rod/bridge (if it's not fixed) due to the added tension from the heavier strings.
p11027
aVI put one of my six strings in drop A and managed just fine.
p11028
aVI've been playing in Drop A on my 6 (learned a bunch of Safety Fire songs) but I didn't think it would be possible to learn any Tesseract. Which songs could I learn?
p11029
aV3 out of the 4 suites on Altered State are in Drop A, so you could learn most of the album, Of Reality is the only suite in drop Ab.\u000a\u000aOff of One, Concealing Fate is drop Ab, so that rules out most of the album unfortunately. Not sure about the rest?
p11030
aVThe vast majority of their material seems to be in some variant of drop A: AEAEAD or something like that. I just tuned to a more typical drop A; they don't often push into the very very high end of the range anyway. As long as you have that low A you can pretty much take your pick.
p11031

p11046
aVBut that's not how it is at all. And I don't think their intent on this record was to throw as many notes in the tracks and movements as possible, I think the intent was to create an experience out of an atmosphere. They use the reverb, the delay,  even the vocals not necessarily as solitary instruments but rather as ingredients in a metaphorical soup. \u000a\u000aBut, I understand some people won't like it and that's okay! I hope I didn't come off snide or cynical, nor do I mean to change your mind, only to explain (my interpretation of the album).

asVFalse Awakening Suite - Dream Theater
p11107
(lp11108
VMuch as I dig this track... why did they feel necessary to make it a suite? \u000a\u000aWhat is added to this track by dividing it into three parts? It's less than three minutes long, and there's no dynamic, noticeable difference between them. \u000a\u000aDoes anyone why they chose to do this?
p11109
aVThere is a dramatic pause between each section, which probably implies that they were at least trying to make it three separate parts. \u000a\u000aI think it was probably just a problem with the composition. I've tried to write songs with drastically different parts, and every fucking time, the two "different" parts end up sounding similar. If they're at all like me, they originally intended for the three parts to sound more different, but somewhere during the songwriting process they ended up putting too much effort into making it flow together for the three parts to really sound distinct.
p11110
aVOkay, I see where you're coming from, but at the point when all is said and done, why still keep it as three parts? \u000a\u000aMy theory is that they have a bunch of song title ideas lined up and wanted to burn off a few more than usual so they used all the sleep disorder ones on one song. 
p11111
aVIn the end, you usually stick to the original concept. They had this idea of a suite, so they tried to make a suite, but it ended up as a coherent instrumental. I bet they still hear it as a suite. They hear the differences in the melodies, the subtle changes in instrumentation, and to them these changes are much bigger than they are to us. \u000a\u000aI bet the original idea was to make a concept song about different sleep disorders. I bet they had this concept in mind even when this album was recorded. Sometimes, it's only in retrospect that you realize things like how similar different parts sound.
p11112
aVThanks, I see more of the process behind it now. \u000a\u000aI honestly wasn't expecting such a legitimate answer. Cheers. 
p11113
aV[As far as I know, they mainly wrote it as an opening track for their live shows.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xFtIY8Qs8A) That's the best explanation I can give.
p11114
aVDoes anyone know if Mangini played the percussion on this song? It sounds like they recorded with real instruments, so it'd make sense if there was an orchestral percussionist along with the strings. But, I also bet that Mangini could play those parts himself if he really wanted to, being a former music professor and whatnot. 
p11115
aVHe did play them yeah\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/RWMjLeez49I?t=1m14s 
p11116
aVIn that case, I'm really impressed. That song has textbook percussion, quite top notch. Maybe not at the level of the greatest orchestral percussionists, but good enough to trick a fool like me! 
p11117
aVThey wrote it to become something quick that they could play over the PA right before their set. It's works in that capacity, but not in much of anything else.

p11133
aVDan seems much more comfortable on a stage. Ashe is a great studio vocalist though. 
p11134
aVTotally agree. I've only seen them once with Elliot on vocals (he had a good voice but his screams were way too harsh for the general vibe). Now that Dan is back I can't wait until they come back to SoCal.
p11135
aVSpecifically around 9:20 - them highs
p11136
aVReally excited for the live album that they have coming out soon. And there's a new Voices from the Fuselage album coming out soon too. Seems like a win/win for fans of both Ashe and Dan like myself. 
p11137
aVI genuinely loved Ashe's voice, but Dan sounds just fine. I really hope the next Tesseract album keeps the screams to a minimum.\u000a\u000aPlus, Voices from The Fuselage sounds like it could potentially be great. Win/win.

V&gt; What Opeth's Heritage should have been.\u000a\u000aHuh?\u000a\u000aSome of the guitar/keys tones are similar, but music-wise this is pretty far from anything Opeth has done, or "should have" done.  Sounds closer to Beardfish's wheelhouse if I had to compare it to another contemporary band.
p11155
aVHaha I knew I'd get in trouble for that statement. I am a die hard Opeth fan and mean no offense and enjoyed Heritage to a certain extent, I just find this a much more interesting, refreshing take on modernizing the classic prog rock sound.

asVJust curious, how many of you guys are music majors?
p11160
(lp11161
VI wish I was, or had at least studied music in more detail. Theory is hard when you're trying to figure it out on your own!
p11162
aVYeah man. I feel I do ok without theory. It just makes it more challenging sometimes. You say you are the same and your stuff comes out pretty good \U0001f609
p11163
aVUnfortunately, a degree in Music wasn't very realistic for me. I am thinking about pursuing a degree in some sort of audio engineering related field.
p11164
aVI personnally would only recommend that field if you're more interested in the more technical sides of AE or are willing to combine it with a dual major or a minor in electrical/mechanical/computer engineering. Or choose one of them with a minor in AE if it's possible. I only say this because pretty much everyone I know who majored in AE at my university has ended up working at guitar center or something like that and has been unable to find anything better or anything steady at all. It's been this way for 6-8 years for all those guys now. If you're mainly interested in mixing/mastering/sound design I'd recommend just using the vast resources on the Internet and honing your craft at home. Invest your money in good equipment and spend your time practicing and not going deep into debt. Not trying to crush your dreams just giving you my experiences.

aVDude. Thank you. Seriously.

aVParty of one! Graduated with a BM (I know, I know, chuckle away) in education and performance. \u000a\u000aAnd yes, one of the main reasons I love progressive music is getting to dive into and work to discover the little details and intricacies over multiple listens. It's mah fav. :)

p11174
aVI was a composition major at university of Akron for a semester and dropped out because my parents said they wouldn't support it, despite putting both my sisters through school for violin and cello performance. I was in theory class with classical and jazz musicians and I knew all the answers and no one else knew jack shit. The classical kids thought I was a rockstar because I liked to party once a week, and the Jazz kids saw me as a nerd who would do their homework for them. I was like, "fuck this, I'll write the songs they teach to these goofbags." Now I bus tables 15-20 hours a week and am working on about 5 different rock opera while honing my vocals and pro tools skills via pop and hip-hop collaborations, and maintaining performance through solo acoustic arrangements of 20+ of all those songs. I don't get laid, obviously. I like to analyze most music but I love prog metal because of the atonality of bands like periphery, Sikth, the faceless, rings of Saturn, and of course the Meshugganer dudes. I purposefully do not analyze it much because I love the feeling of being in space and/or death and destruction and/or jumping around with bunnies in the woods I get from bands like that. Although I definitely took the time to figure out the time signature of ever forthright's "little Albert experiment." Sorry for the lack of caps, I'm typing this from an iPhone my mom bought me because she secretly feels bad for giving birth to me.

Generally more experimental than his main band.\u000a[Steven Wilson - Ancestral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6bF6oKJKKQ)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a*no-man*\u000a\u000aSteven Wilson's band from before even Porcupine Tree, together with his long-time friend  Tim Bowness. Comparable to early PT, very mellow prog with a bit of jazz, ambient and trip-hop thrown in. \u000a\u000a[No-Man - Together We're Stranger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8-WLOPIHNI)\u000a\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a*Blackfield*\u000a\u000aA collaboration between Steven Wilson and Aviv Geffen.

Steven Wilson also mixed a couple of tarcks for them so there's that.\u000a\u000a[Anathema - Thin Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiVEj5hIbOo)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a*Nosound*\u000a\u000aA good if if rather blatant PT clone, lead by the Italian multi-instrumentalist Giancarlo Erra. Former PT drummer Chris Maitland makes an appearance from time to time. Before you ask, yes, there is a collaboration between Giancarlo Erra and Tim Bowness. It's called Memories of Machines. Guess what it sounds like.\u000a\u000a[Nosound - In My Fears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjXKDM5wqx4)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a*The Pineapple Thief*\u000a\u000aNot only the band name sounds similar.

They've been out with us two or three times and they keep coming back and I think the reason they keep coming back is because they make new fans every time they come and play with us. And in some ways that's the biggest thrill of all for me to know that we can introduce music that I love, that we love - and I'm a huge Oceansize fan - to new people and to our fans, I mean they're super nice guys, it's always a pleasure to tour with those guys."*\u000a\u000a[Oceansize - Ornament, The Last Wrongs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYAF_MgV0JA)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aNot to brag or anything but I could probably list 20-30 bands or collaborations but I gotta run.

p11279
aVIt's not dead by any means, but it's only got 10.6% as many subs as progmetal, and that ratio seems off to me. Then again, the heyday of post-metal is past us... RIP 2004-2006.
p11280
aV'Post-metal' never really had a heyday as it was based on albums like Spirit of Eden at the end of the 80's and then GY!BE toyed around with their influence before all these other outifts decided to run with it.
p11281
aVYeah. It sucks to realize that Panopticon is almost 11, and ISIS has been disbanded for five years. I guess I can count myself among the lucky few who got to seem them *a lot* over the years, as well as twice on the farewell tour.\u000a\u000aUgh.

aVIf a ballad doesn't have the power behind it the worst thing you can do is give it all to the vocalist to carry the song. Thankfully the guitar is the driving force of this song, which really pulls everything else up along with it. I'm tempted to give this album the label of "Petrucci's best work in a while", and this song is just one proof of that.

aVHead over to /r/IDM and start checking some stuff out. Plenty of those guys draw on elements commonly found in prog metal, or are directly inspired by metal . I'm getting into it more and more myself, but my introduction was The Flashbulb. His old stuff (like 2005ish and before) as well as Hardscrabble is pretty awesome stuff. His new stuff is also awesome, though quite a bit different. 
p11384
aVWhat is IDM exactly?
p11385
aVIt stands for Intelligent Dance Music. It's still EDM, but I've found that a lot of electronic styles/artists that I like can be found under this category, either on /r/IDM or via Google. It was a helpful starting point when I was trying to dive further into electronic music myself. Plus it seems to me that 'IDM artists' are much more metal in general haha.

aVDefinetely check out BT - This Binary Universe [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve8WaGmyhfI&amp;list=PLA9E61F998DAFF2C0)\u000a\u000aDoesn't have heavy guitars or what not, but it's one piece of music that tells a story. It features live orchestration and glitch elements. It's instrumental goodness that creates it's own world for the listener.
p11387
aVIf you like some of the more jazz influences in prog/fusion, check out Squarepusher, particularly the earlier albums.
p11388
aVI'd need to have my music collection at hand, but check out the song  Tabris by Reso.\u000a\u000aAlso, i guess a little played at this stage, but check out the first skirllex album. Heavy as fuck and has complexity that'll keep you interested for a month or so.\u000a\u000aCheck out prodigy - start with the song invaders must die, then explore that album if you like a bit of that..\u000a\u000aCehck out Pendulum - start wit the song the island part 2,\u000a"Plasticworld" (featuring Fats and TC) 	6:21\u000a"Hold Your Colour"   	5:28\u000a"Streamline"  \u000a\u000aDon't know if it's what your into, but it's stuff that makes me groove
p11389
aVI will check that out! Thanks for the reply!
p11390
aV&gt; Hold Your Colour\u000a\u000aThe most progressive Pendulum song is 18 Pendulum songs at the same time! ;D\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g61brCepGVE
p11391
aVHaha make that 19! Had pendulum on in the back ground..  Who even thinks of that 
p11392
aVWhat kind of prog do you like? I wouldn't recommend the same EDM to someone who likes Meshuggah as opposed to, say, Dream Theatre.
p11393
aVI like both of them actually. But a little bit towards Dream Theater. Periphery is a good example of band i like that has nice EDM elements, i was looking for something like that.
p11394
aVWell, for the aggressive side I think you'd like electro house. Knife Party's new album Abandon Ship is a good example of this.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, if you want something somewhat light and airy, I'd recommend some progressive trance/house like [BT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doedi2MI-iM), [Tiesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPfUzoFDIC0), [Deadmau5] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKi9Z-f6qX4), and Above and Beyond (haven't listened to enough to give you a good song recommendation).\u000a\u000aPeriphery has also named [Telefon Tel Aviv] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYnmP8HOZ00) and Trifonic as influences to their electronic side, [The Flashbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iry-JfsJN6g) is along the same lines too.
p11395
aVThanks a lot!!
p11396
aVTake a look at [Dark Model](https://www.youtube.com/user/ModelElectronic)
p11397
aVTry [Infected Mushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNte4dTMwe4)! They're the ones that got me interested in electronic music! (along with Pendulum, but they've already been mentioned)\u000a\u000aTheir earlier trance stuff is probably more "proggy," but their [newer material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uLK4hDJC84) is just as cool imo.
p11398
aVIf you want a more "strictly" EDM record (as opposed to more rock inspired stuff like Pendulum and Infected Mushroom) that has a lot of variety in pace, try [this jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdUjFxqN9QQ&amp;list=PLCsokAw0UtmiPuELOr8JZmOTQeIaX4sVT).\u000a\u000aMaybe not the most accessible from a metal background, but really good if you want something different.\u000a\u000aEdit: two more thoughts I had, [Skrillex - Recess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1qgY7GN1tY) is super agro and a ton of variety and just really good.  Another with a lot of variety and a little more chill is [SBTRKT's self-titled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1eRWKPM3HI&amp;list=PLf6tiIPq88T5o2LLNlHVBVmbpvsOyQMIU).
p11399
aVI don't know if this really fits the EDM label, but Kashiwa Daisuke makes dope dreamscape, progressive ass electronic music. \u000a\u000a[Program Music 1 - Stella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHjHQoxq9O0)\u000a\u000aI know 36 minutes is a bit, but it's worth the listen.

VI've seen them posted a few times, but these guys are so goddamn good, it's weird they aren't posted more. They've got a HUGE Meshuggah vibe. Too bad they've only got one album. I don't know if they're working on anything new, but I really hope to hear more some day. 
p11415
aVThey definitely remind me of Meshuggah. Even though I saw the waveform, that wall of sound that hits at around 30 secs caught me off guard.
