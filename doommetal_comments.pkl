aVA lot of it looks like it's influenced by 80s pulp fantasy novels, so maybe start there. 
p18
aVYou're more likely to get an answer in /r/Art/, /r/drawing/ or /r/painting/, what does it matter if it's a doom album art or not?

p22
aVI would say that's optional. Pot on the other hand is mandatory.
p23
aVProbably more important than the art itself
p24
aVThe example you posted was most likely drawn mostly by hand first, then brought into photoshop to add color and texture.\u000a\u000aJohn Dyer Baizley (Baroness) works in a very similar way. As you can see from [this image,](http://aperfectmonster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Baroness-_Red-Album_-Cover.jpg) he's using scanned watercolor washes underneath his inked drawing. In addition to vibrant, organic coloring, the watercolors add texture from the paper, making the finished piece more unique.\u000a\u000aOther than that, there is really no 'tutorial' on how to do this other than ***practice as much as you can.*** The more you draw, the better you will get.
p25
aVI JUST noticed the sperm fertilizing eggs in the background of this cover.
p26
aVJohn Baizley does a lot of metal album art in that style, he's done some interviews that might be enlightening. 
p27
aVGloomy water colors with thick black outlines. Maybe try a wax crayon to make the outline, water color, and some acrylic black paint over the wax? Or draw it with black pen, then water color. Maybe you can make me an album cover one day!
p28
aVCheck out art nouveau 
p29
aVThat's another favorite style of mine, its a bit similar with lighter elements. 
p30
aVYes, very similar shading if the type of work you're looking to do is what's in the op. 
p31
aVThat looks to me like pens and watercolor.There's a veritable arseload of pens out there (cant link cause im in mobile) but the faber castle and steadtler fineliners are what i use, reasonable price and they last a fair while. I can explain the process a bit more if you'd like.
p32
aVLike any kind of art just practice constantly. I mostly work with inks and watercolors and there is no better way to improve than just constantly making art. Imitate the stuff you like and eventually develop your own style.

p72
aVwoah guys calm down, i think the point is and its pretty inconsequential for that matter, is that its cool for a "corporate pop star" to like doom.
p73
aVIt's not like she said Cirith Ungol by Reverend Bizarre she said the most famous band with the song that's easiest to remember.
p74
aVlook i understand the point you're trying to make, but seriously no one cares, doom metal isn't that elitist. Her answer is adequate anyway. If someone asked you what your favorite metal song was what would you say? If someone asked me I'd probably not have an answer and just say something along the same lines. Am i really gonna sit there and explain to them why Xasthur's Prison of Mirrors is my favorite song while they stare at me blankly not knowing what the fuck I'm talking about? or am i gonna say The Trooper by Iron Maiden fuck yeah!!! She's not a metal head and (I'm assuming) an interviewer asked her. It's not like Miley Cyrus saying she never listened to a jay-z song after she used a line about it in a song.

asVsearching for doom metal musicians
p96
(lp97
VI don't know if this will make sense, but the guitar you play is irrelevant. You just need to get the instrument to play low notes without buzzing on any frets. So if you're detuned a half or full step below normal E tuning then it should ring clear. \u000a\u000aThe best musicians are telling a story, in this case their guitars might evoke the slow crawl of rust across a desolate urban landscape void of humans, or crops failing mysteriously of blight, or villages succumbing to a plague one by one, or horrors of the last moments on earth as ICBMs are launched for delivery to your practice space.  Just get the right dark mood, which might need larger speakers and amps that are stronger on the low end. 
p98
aVIt's not exactly *irrelevant* what guitar you use, I mean you wouldn't use a Fender Strat to play death metal, for example.  I mean, it's physically possible, but you certainly wouldn't chose to. 
p99
aVSingle coils can work fine. The amp settings and such make more of a diffrence.
p100
aVI can't condone drug use but I do recommend you try to take the time to learn as much about music theory as possible. Music is a language, and you need to learn the elements of it before you can start to write poetry. Once you have the basic elements in place, you can start to make it a regular part of your life. \u000a\u000aFor example, some elements of heavy metal / doom metal music that I like are the slow, empty fifth chord riffs with a groovy beat. In fact, in a short answer to your main question, fifths are really the key to metal. If you play on that interval (say A to E flat) with the right distortion and with a cool rhythm, you're already on your way to writing heavy riffs. \u000a\u000aJust take it slow, remember that music is a science as well as a language and above all, it's absolutely imperative that you ***Listen to Vol. 4***
p101
aVThe easy answer is - smoke weed. But seriously, I play bass so composing from a bassist's POV is something entirely different than guitar. But when composing, First, I choose a slower tempo (depends on the mood I want to set), compose very easy straight drums (kick/hihat snare/hihate kick/hihat snare/hihat 4/4 pattern) and just jam to them. Messing with different chord patterns and  sounds is a must. I'm trying to create/find very interesting riff progression. When I have some basic structure coming out, I try to expand on that. mostly using minor, harmonic and melodic scales. Then, I rework the drums so the bass and drums are locked in together (this is the hardest part, creating good drumline locked in with the bassline). Then I just add some melodies and it's near finished. Then I play and toy with the song to see if it can be improved. Sometimes, I do smoke weed during some or whole part of the ordeal. But if you decide to smoke, compose both stoned and sober. Sometimes when you're stoned (or on drugs generally), you think you can compose a maestro piece but then you sober up and discover that it's utter shit.\u000a\u000aProtip: you might or might not downtune your guitar. That depends solely on you and the sound you want to achieve. You can play some heavy funeral shit even on a guitar E A D G C e, if you're creative. But if you like to downtune then go ahead and compose!

VWTF WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR DRUGS FROM 
p109
aVDopesmoker was a fun experience when I was really high, I remember the guitar feeling like some kind of calm tide next to an island, but it felt like the water was a digital render, like it was made out of polygons and all blocky. When the drums and bass came in, it felt slowly like I was being taken off the floor and then when the bass does the big slide in and starts playing the riff I was swept up off the chair I was on, and I was suddenly backflipping through this giant ocean, it had gone from a really pale cyan colour to a deep, deep blue by this point.\u000a\u000aI'm not too sure what happened for the next 10 minutes really, I was just spinning around seeing all the currents of water.\u000a\u000aNot on a par with your story OP, but I figured I'd share something. it's interesting we both think of giant oceans when the bass comes in though, I wonder if it happens to anyone else?
p110
aVI have a "doom land" in my head. Which I later learned was just the world from "Dune", but with more hooded cultists and such.\u000a\u000aA post apocalyptic desert with brutalist stone temples, the sky a hazy yellow from dust and chemicals.\u000a\u000aShit's fun. 
p111
aVYour story kinda completely pushes away the urge to answer your initial question. But your story also really makes me want to smoke another joint

p125

VYob, for the most part. Theyre split fairly evenly with singing and growling. Marrow, the last song off of their latest record, though, is one of my new favorite doom tracks.
p127
aVYob. I can't get into yob. The growls just ruin it for me, but the rest I like.
p128
aVgive YOB another go. throw Atma or The Unreal Never Lived on. once you get into Mike's riffs they are much more enjoyable! \u000a\u000aor try bands like Aleph Null and Samothrace!
p129
aVFor more obvious ones you might have missed there is [Electric Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FNZRGfVvw) and [Reverend Bizarre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar7nMRyl32E). The band I instantly thought about was [The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3ZljcO7xw), and just for the hell of it you might like [The Angelic Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ZiU7ahZso).
p130
aVEW is great. Come My Fanatics has to be my favorite of their albums. Didn't dig the other two that much, but the Angelic Process was interesting, thanks man.
p131
aVThere's a band that's vaguely similar to TAP, though I don't find them as soul imploding with the weight of the universe as TAP, called [Nadja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgl3AK8php8) if you want more stuff like that.\u000a\u000aKnowing a bit about your tastes now I'd recommend giving [this album by Suma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3-Qa81nFhs) a listen. Another good one is [Ocean Chief](http://oceanchief.bandcamp.com/album/sten). Possibly [Omega Massif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLxZTqKgOf4) as well, even though they are instrumental.\u000a\u000aTrying to think about this stuff made me realise how much great music there is without clean vocals though dude haha

p185
aVSounds like doom metal to me. I'm pretty stoked on it.

aVThey're definitly doom, it's a broad genre- it's goes from sleep to the sword, it doesn't have to be incredibly slow.

aVHoly shit, what a show.  Got the opportunity to see Harassor and Iron Reagan open for EHG a couple weeks ago, and even though Gwar was playing the same night just down the street, this was one of the most intense crowds I've seen here in Boise.  On top of that, this was at the Crazy Horse, a newly reopened venue that I think has one of the most photogenic divey vibes of any venue in this town.  Still reverbrating in this memory. \u000a\u000aFull album:\u000ahttps://www.flickr.com/photos/louderthanlight/sets/72157649460255936/\u000a\u000aIron Reagan:\u000ahttps://www.flickr.com/photos/louderthanlight/sets/72157647084423764/\u000a\u000aHarassor:\u000ahttps://www.flickr.com/photos/louderthanlight/sets/72157649007955008/\u000a\u000aMy facebook page:\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/LouderThanLight\u000a\u000a\u000a

p282
aVHuh, that's weird. I've never been on shreddit but I can't imagine why they'd get shit. I'm the same way. I dig some thrash but don't really listen to much, but they're dope as fuck as far as I know.

VToday's Louder Than Light Throwback comes from sad news, as it has been announced that Jonathan Athon of Black Tusk has died following a serious motorcycle accident. I had the fortune of photographing Black Tusk very early in my adventure. By my count, they were the 4th show in which I tried my hand at concert photography; the first show I took my then 13 year old son to, and the last show that took place at the now-defunct Boise Venue. So here's to you, Athon, RIP.\u000a\u000aMy Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/LouderThanLight\u000a\u000aBonus picture: https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5614/15132353244_d321395583_h.jpg\u000a\u000a

Would live to see what you come up with. Japanese influence would be sick! Samurai or sholin masters are super cool too. I'm sure whatever you come up with would be sick.

p372
aVThat sounds glorious. Fudge Tunnel have a [sludge cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xugTdAwhUAY) of Sunshine of Your Love that's along those lines and it's proof that low and slow is the way to go. \u000a\u000aI've been putting blues standards into the Metallum for a while and I haven't much unless you want Led Zeppelin covers. Seems this is just one for wistful longing unless I'm forgetting some really obvious ones.\u000a\u000aGuess Mike Scheidt doing Townes is close enough.

All of the gods and heroes of Lordran have fled or gone insane. There is no real "antagonist" other than the inevitable entropic decay of the universe.

aVBest thing to do is just play a dark and/or active game with the music turned off, and play your own music in the background.\u000a\u000aPersonally I like GTA, driving games like Dirt, and Painkiller.  Painkiller definitely matches doom metal music.\u000a\u000a

aVCheck out this review for ["To The Void" by Ixion](http://heavymetalspotlight.blogspot.com/2012/12/236-ixion-to-void.html)\u000a\u000a*"I first heard of Ixion in passing, summarised neatly as "space-doom". In all possibility, this is the most fitting description anyone could have come up with. Very overt, soaring keyboards feature prominently in the album, and really sculpt it's atmosphere into one which utterly, unapologetically evokes space; vast, beautiful and filled with wonder, but at the same time cold, uneasy, and perhaps as much filled with melancholy and sorrow as with joy."*\u000a\u000aMusically, they're melodic doom-death in the vein of Draconian, minus the female vocals. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVgyf4T4CwE

aVSalem's Pot is pretty damn good. They seem to be influenced by old horror and sci-fi movies. \u000a\u000aThe guitar solo at 7:20 in this song sounds like a sound effect from an old 50's/60's alien movie, like the sound of UFOs invading or something, it's fucking awesome\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31S7ENwlEEM

VHey, guys. I'm wasn't sure about posting this because I don't feel it's really up to a good enough standard recording and mixing wise. And I hate my singing, but that's just me. I think I should just man up and share what I made.\u000a\u000aI'm looking for suggestions as to what 'labels' fit my music. Is it stoner, is it trad doom, is it neither? I'm not sure.\u000a\u000aThe main reason for this EP is to try to attract band members who can help me write/record/perform and such, I don't want to be a one-man band for longer than I have to be. Looking for a guitarist, a bassist and a drummer in the South of England. If you're interested, chuck me a message or something.\u000a\u000aCheers.
p518
aVIf you don't like your singing you can experiment with burying it in the mix a bit more and making it more of background instead of foreground, so to speak. Also try using more effects on it. What you achieve by this you draw less attention to the vocals, if you don't want them to be the main focus. Examples of band that kinda do it:\u000a\u000a* [Dopelord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsLdIZGU-_w)\u000a* [Demonic Death Judge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=360t8y9P-QQ)\u000a* [Windhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZ9w5OiyKo)\u000a\u000aThe guitars and vocals are ok in my opinion (I'd turn vocals down though), the mix needs more fuzzy bass and drumming is too repetitive and plain.\u000a\u000aAll that said, your compositions are very good and this material has much potential. All the best!
p519
aVYeah, I was mixing on headphones because I haven't gotten myself a decent pair of monitors yet. The vocals seem to stand out more with some speakers than others. they were definitely more subtle in the headphones I was using to mix.\u000a\u000aI'm already really into Windhand, I've heard the Demonic Death Judge one before and that Dopelord one is great, I'll definitely check them out more. I was going for a Jus Oborn type vocal style but I ended up probably nearer Brian Molko at times. I haven't done much singing before, I need a lot of practice.\u000a\u000aThe drumming was the weakest part in theory when I wrote everything. I'm not a drummer and I've had to teach myself so much about drums already to manage to write what I ended up with. I definitely need a drummer to collab with, that could really take the music up a few levels.
p520
aVI'll second what Spidzior said about mixing the vocals. And don't even sweat being right on pitch. If you listen to Electic Wizard enough, you'll notice they often aren't on it all the time either. Just lower the vocals into the background, and you'll have something perfect. I personally love everything else about it. I'd volunteer to drum for you if I wasn't on the other side of the world. Sick album art too.\u000a\u000aThis is definitely some wicked stuff. Can't wait to hear more!

aVThis'll be all about sludge because you're all hungover and therefore need the hair of the dog that bit you.\u000a\u000aGraves at Sea play lovely rumbly sludge. Hear [their side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFJs2pWeSr8) of the split with Sourvein they did. (Last year!) Catchy, mid-tempo sludge riffs with alternating shrill and growly vocals. \u000a\u000aAnd if you're listening to Graves at Sea, hear [Primitive Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aC28wt2sWo), the other sludge sensation of 2013/2014 that really do need to give us a full length sometime. They're headache-inducing and actually why am I listening to this\u000a\u000aThe North of England, which is really just the South of the States but inverted and older, has a tradition of producing really heavy sludge bands.\u000a\u000aMistress! Brummie sludgers. Started out ripping Bayou blues but later became a sort of sludge/grind band. Someone posted a Mistress song the other day, so start with their earlier stuff for classic sludge and their later stuff for stoner grind. \u000a\u000a[Fudge Tunnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4BMk8wOO0c) were noisy sludge. Big in the 90s. Their cover of Sunshine of Your Love is a good tell. Later on they did some groove metal stuff, dunno if you can stand that but sludge is naturally bluesy anyway. They're a bit like Nailbomb or some of the crossover sludge bands.\u000a\u000a[Sea Bastard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg4wvGQP2sY) have loooooooooooong, chugging riffs. It's their thing. Maybe they want you to try and count the bars and get confused. Vocals are a bit weak.\u000a\u000a[Bumsnogger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJI69wdBGXI) (chortle) play gutter filth. Really inspiring, feel-good music.\u000a\u000a[Iron Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QBi4T4vPGQ) were the quintessential northern sludge band, even if they just sounded like EYEHATEGOD. (Say it again, this time with feeling- EYEHATEGOD. EYEHATEGOD. EYE. HATE. GOD. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH)\u000a\u000a[Space Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMAmgU4ihQw) play "atmospheric" sludge with wooshy spaceship noises and big open soundscapes. Bit more stonery.\u000a\u000aAnd for more English sludge, [Iron Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKM4NQCcTn0) don't have anything unique about their sound because they sound exactly like EYEHATEGOD, but if you want some of that mid 90s existential torment through whining feedback, they're gold.\u000a\u000aCough are quite well known, but most people haven't heard their older stuff. Alternate between paying tribute to Electric Wizard and beating listeners over the head with Sourvein riffs. Their latest releases have all been quite shapeless, but listen to Sigellum Luciferi for what was probably the best all-around sludge album of 2008. Fast riffs, slow riffs, riffs everywhere. And they really can write good lyrics, if you can make them out under all the fuzz. I just wish they'd write shorter, punchier songs like [288 Years of Sin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dcaL_KqvHo). And bloody Acid Witch. So good.\u000a\u000a[Shroud Eater.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpzAHhxZoG0) Really big sound for a power trio. They tend to play fast and they've got one foot in the doom metal camp.\u000a\u000aAnd you guys know [13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3YpFfMxWac), where Electric Wiz's Liz got her start? Had splits with Grief and other sludgers. Big draw is that they're an all-girl band, but they play a really slow and crunchy sludge that's almost bluesless. So just redsy and greenish then. Hah. \u000a\u000aHappy new year, misanthropes.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVLoss is an unsigned band from Nashville that have a funeral influence. Vocals are very deep. Check out 'Cut up, depressed and alone.'\u000a\u000aMorgion is pretty great if you like a little synth accompaniment. Do check out 'All the Glory' and 'All the Loss' in that order (two part song).

(lp657
VJust got home and had a great time. Couldn't get there right at the start and Bongripper played earlier than I expected, but I caught at least half of the set and they sounded great. Went to their merch area and they were all out of shirts, but I did pick up an Elder shirt. Was told Bongripper will have more shirts up on their set in the next week or so. \u000a\u000aElder played a good set and I'm pumped to hear they have a new album coming out soon. They sounded good overall, the live vocals were somewhat mixed but their tracks aren't too vocal heavy anyway. \u000a\u000aI only caught the last couple songs of Graves at Sea because they were playing at the same time as Elder. Only listened to them once or twice before but they really impressed me, I'll certainly be looking into them further. \u000a\u000aMy second time seeing Windhand, they've just never really clicked with me, but the crowed seemed into it and the singer sounded better than the last time I saw them. \u000a\u000aWeedeater were a big surprise for me, I'd only heard a couple songs from them in the past and they didn't stick with me at the time, but their energy really won me over. The drummer was great to watch, I loved his kicking the cymbals. \u000a\u000aRed Fang had a solid set, I haven't seen them since their first album and they seem to have polished up their performing a bit, but have always been a fun band. No surprises, but good times and the crowed was into it. 
p658
aVNice. I showed up as Greenbeard was ending.  After seeing Goya tear it up I pretty much stayed at the Reaper stage.  Supposedly Arctic is pretty good and I'll give Graves at Sea a go as per your recommendation.  What blew me away was Radio Moscow, I need to check out their releases.  They're psychedelic but they do bring some kickass riffs. Highly recommended.\u000a\u000aBongripper was definitely a brutal sonic adventure and their sound was on point.  Ancestors had some killer psychedelic doomy keys that I was not aware of.   I'm pumped about Elder also, the new song has an awesome hook.  First time seeing Windhand and their tone is much more monstrous live than I was expecting.  Weedeater I think is the perfect blend of styles and they really brought that out live along with a hilarious and awesome stage presence. 10/10 would get drunk and break shit.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately I had to bail before the Fang showed up but not before I grabbed that awesome 10 color silk screened poster.  All in all it was a legendary showing of bands from all over the states and hope that Thief continues to bring kickass tunes that we normally can't reach over here. \u000a
p659
aVThere were some great sets at this show.  I was mainly interested in Bongripper and Weedeater and they didn't disappoint (except for  Weedeater's technical difficulties).  I've seen Weedeater before, so I expected them to be awesome.\u000a\u000aI'd never been into Graves at Sea before, but their show was pretty damn good.  The guitarist from Bongripper was tearing it up in the pit.\u000a\u000aI had hoped to catch Elder, but I think they were at the same time as Graves at Sea, so I missed them.\u000a\u000aIt was the best show I've seen around here for a while, hope they set up more of them in the future.

aVI got it off of eBay, from some dude in Greece.  There's hardly any Sunn O))) patches out there, but I was really happy with this one.
p678
aVI wanted to do full on doom metal, but I found a huge lack of patches from the bands I wanted, so I scratched the idea for two jackets and just made one sweet one. My prized possessions are probably the atomic bitchwax patch and the sabbath and pentagram.\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/AX889wH.jpg\u000a\u000aI'm looking for doom metal patches though, particularly sludge and stoner. I've been dying to get fu machu, mastodon, and monster magnet, and a bunch of other stuff, but it doesn't really seem like there's a lot of them. I'd be interested if anyone was selling them, not just the bands I mentioned, doom in general.

aVChurch of misery is so fucking good. I got that, while heaven wept and Candlemass from deathofthesun in /r/metaltrade a couple months ago. You've got a sweet back patch, is that a cut shirt?

p742
aVI've been wanting to learn how to play bass guitar recently, is it worth learning at all?
p743
aVIt really depends on your determination and past experience with music theory/other instruments. It also depends on how much spare time you have. Even if it's just a few minutes every other day, you need to practice regularly. There's a lot to learn if it's your first instrument, but if you really think you're interested I suggest picking up a guitar and amp, maybe do lessons, try learning some tabs, see if you actually stick with it. That's really the only way to know for sure if it's for you.

aVI encountered that during Burgerama, but not during Psycho De Mayo. I nearly got busted going in for Burgerama...luckily some guy before me got busted and they were too busy with him that I walked right past security...patted him down in the exact spot I hid my shit too. At Burgerama they also hassled me for walking outside with a beer without any posted signs saying otherwise, were being total dicks about it when I was explaining that to them too. They didn't even pat me down for Psycho De Mayo though. Probably just depends which security dudes they hire for that day.

Even "tweaked" the buttons on the chest pockets of my battle jacket like they were nipples. \u000a\u000a Are people bringing weapons to doom metal shows this big of a problem? I've never encountered a pat down in the close to 15 years of going to shows until LA.

aVOther way around, if anything; Led Zeppelin (album) was released in 1969, Paranoid was 1970. More of a coincidence I'd say. However the rest of the song is a direct lift from a guy called Jake Holmes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTsvs-pAGDc

p869
aVIt's one of the first answers in our FAQ.\u000a\u000aI added the "yes, please post non-doom too, as long as it's something doom fans might like" thing early on, because there's so much out there that many people in this sub would find fascinating.\u000a\u000aPlus, it's just fun to dig through the bones of doom's ancestors.
p870
aVI know I may get some mad down votes for this, but I  personally feel in my opinion that this is a proto doom song. It's based around three chords, it's slow, it talks about death, it is trippy, it zones you the fuck out, it makes you want to smoke mad pot. Yeah, this be some old school non metal doom.
p871
aVThis and "She's so Heavy" by the beatles are some of the earliest doom sounds in my opinion.
p872
aVShe's So Heavy needs a proper doom cover. I've been wanting to do one but I lack a band. If that last riff was beefed and slowed down, I could listen to it forever.
p873
aVOh man! My favourite band, Type O Negative, covered that. They're not the typical doom band, but their cover is super doomy. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMVKpDbVxBs) it is. They sung three songs by the Beatles in this medley.

aVThis song is really so many things when you look at it, including having doom aspects, so I think your safe with your proposition.

aVIt's even a bit dirgey, I wish we had more back to basics posts like this in this sub. This song will never let me forget the first time I ever tripped on shrooms, I was in my old shitty apartment with my friends, we were listening to this song and had all the lights off with candles and incense burning while a storm was going on outside...first time I ever thought about and accepted death without being terrified of it.

Back in my "grunge days" though, this was my least favourite Nirvana album.\u000aAnd remember, two of Kurts best friends were Mark Lanegan and Dylan Carlson... so he definitely knew what heavy music is

VI think this is Csihar's best vocal performance. The organ is at the other end of the church from the sanctuary (where I assume the amps were set up), so it probably created an antiphonal effect in live performance that isn't captured here, where you have Csihar's voice coming from the front and the organ coming from the back.\u000a\u000aedit: if you like the use of the organ in this, give Messiaen's [Apparition of the Eternal Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUgm1Pp_l9Y) a listen.

(lp1014
VBeen a long time since I used anything. Life make more sense and I'm less of a dick for it. Stoner rock is just downright fucking cool music. I'll enjoy Roadsaw with a straight mind any time thanks. For me it became a case of rock out and take control of your shit because that actually rocks, rather than medicate your pathetic snivelling hiney in a semi-psycotic dependant state of confusion. Times change. Everyone is different. Lots of my friends are into all sorts of things and I don't care, they're cool about shit.
p1015
aVused to use all kinds of stuff years ago. Havent now in awhile. I do still drink pretty often, but im never listening to doom while i'm drunk. It's generally kick ass background music to when I am working or browsing reddit.
p1016
aVSame here: the regularity of the heavy riffs helps me focus when I'm working.
p1017
aVListen to AND play in a stoner doom band. No drinking, getting high, or smoking cigarettes. 
p1018
aVSame here!
p1019
aVDitto
p1020
aVWhy would I smoke weed or do drugs while listening to doom?\u000a\u000aI like mellow sounds, I'm a mellow dude, and a bit on the depressive side. I enjoy music that reflects my mental state.
p1021
aVI am also a mellow depressive dude and think my love of doom springs from that.\u000a\u000aDrinking totally enhances the experience for me. I expect drugs would also do that but I don't have any.
p1022
aVWow, a congregation of mellow depressed dudes, me included. Hello friends :)
p1023
aVWelcome. I'm not even sure I'm depressed, I just like to listen to doom and pretend that I am. Depressive things resonate with me.
p1024
aVBe glad you're not haha, it's a dark road that looks inviting. I know what you mean though, depressing things hit the hardest emotionally compared to everything else with me\u000a
p1025
aVCan relate to that. My depression may be the cause of me listening to doom metal, but there is just no other music that feels this real to me. "Happy" music just feels like a delusion.
p1026
aVBig fan of stoner but I don't do weed (or cigs/alcohol). Just enjoying the heavy rifs!
p1027
aVRight here. Stoner doom is just good stuff. However, a lot of my time spent listening to it (especially full and even consecutive Dopesmoker listening) has been when I'm loopily tired.
p1028
aVWait... is that like a prerequisite? Have been into doom for years and never in that ttme had I taken any drug, apart from alcohol. 
p1029
aVStoner Doom is my favorite genre. Only tried weed once and it wasn't related to the music. I don't care about the relation of weed to the genre, but it kinda gets annoying that other people think you're a stoner just for listening to the genre. Some are even offended if you're not a stoner. Overall I think stoner doom concerts are the most chill, might be because of weed but also overall attitude of people.
p1030
aVI can't speak for myself, I write my best riffs stoned. However I do have friends that are straight edge and way into stoner metal. While the music lends itself to stoners, indulging is not a requirement. 
p1031
aVZero drugs or alcohol or anything. I actually try to avoid people that openly express their love for beer or weed. People don't don't expect that kind of behavior from me because some of my favorite bands are sabbath, fu Manchu, and municipal waste, a ton of heavily drug and alcohol influenced bands. I also really enjoy a lot of punk, straight edge included, and I get a lot of funny looks when I jump from electric wizard to minor threat. I feel like the music you enjoy shouldn't dictate your lifestyle. \u000a\u000aI don't drink or smoke because of events caused by other people that put me in some really bad places in life. I decided a couple years ago that I wasn't going to become the person I hated most.   
p1032
aVI do.  No drugs.
p1033
aVI've never smoked weed or done any other drugs.  I just love me some heavy riffs.  I honestly don't see how this would be strange to enjoy without an altered state of mind.  I even love the droney stuff.  I love the subtle complexity of the heaviest, lowest sounds.  
p1034
aVHey congrats on two years dude im proud of ya
p1035
aVListening to Bongripper makes it tempting to get high and do drugs but I can enjoy almost as much without throwing away my two years of sobriety.
p1036
aVNo drugs, love me some stoner doom. Windhand, Melvins, Sleep, Yob all day. Funny thing is I'm a substance abuse counselor. Go figure.

p1046
aVAside from a little bit of weed for cancer therapy a year and half ago, I havent smoked anything illegal in over 15 years.  Doom and Stoner Doom is some of my favorite music.
p1047
aVI drink, but not in excess, and no drugs. 
p1048
aVused to smoke, quit over 5 years ago. Drink about a sixer a month.
p1049
aVI only drink, but not all that much. I did smoke weed when I first learned to love stoner doom.
p1050
aVMe.  Been 15+ years since i smoked.  Just love the genres sound.
p1051
aVI remember seeing this on the front page a while back.  If you have to do drugs to listen to a music, then its not very good music.  I HATE that its called stoner rock.  Its just hard rock with tinges of other stuff thrown in.  Now certain kinds of EDM, I definitely cant imagine listening to those sober.
p1052
aVI think pot makes good music better and bad music way worse.

aVyeah the stoner tag annoys me too, I generally say "heavy" in place of "stoner" (i.e., "heavy rock," "heavy doom").
p1054
aVI hate trying to get explain what kind of music I play to people who don't know what that means.  Josh homme even hates the name and he's one of the guys that pioneered the genre.
p1055
aVdoes he even call Kyuss "desert rock?" I know he refers to QOTSA as "robot rock," but I know for sure he doesn't call Kyuss stoner rock.
p1056
aVNot sure.  I know I've seen him in interviews mention he hates the term "stoner rock"

aVchecking in, don't do any drugs, just love big, slow, simple riffs. Love a lot ff Drone, ambient, experimental, found-sound kinds of stuff too for much the same sort of reasons.
p1065
aVI used a couple of times but it wasn't for me, although i am addicted to coffee and doom metal every morning. 
p1066
aVStoner is my favorite kind of metal by far. I never smoked anything and I never will. Just enjoying some pretty fucking badass riffs and heavy songs. Like one said before, the slow tempo and repetitive riffs help me to focus when I try to work. Weird but it works for me. When I listen to stoner in public places, life seems to go at 10x speed and I almost feel like I'm somewhere else out of this world. Drugs don't help, the music is the only drug.

aVI pretty much listened to stoner metal and doom exclusively from ages 19-22 and I had never been high.\u000a\u000atl:dr doom metal is the gateway drug.
p1069
aVI was going to ask this myself.  I don't do any drugs and never have.  Just 2 or 3 beers or a mixed drink once in a while on a weekend.  \u000a\u000aI often listen to stoner/doom while I'm relaxing at my computer playing games, especially driving or FPS games.  I think I get into a nice natural high state, no drugs required.\u000a
p1070
aVOne of my favorite bands is Eyehategod, but I don't do heroin (anymore).  I also had stopped smoking by the time I was at the apex of my Sleep worship.
p1071
aVYup, me. I've been listening to the music since before any of my peers were experimenting with drugs. Master of Reality was my gateway drug. I've smoked pot a couple times, but it's not really for me. I'm not even a heavy drinker. 
p1072
aVI don't smoke for job reasons. If I did it wouldn't be for music. 
p1073
aVI smoke when i have the contacts and the money, but that is maybe 50-60% of the time. I still listen to doom/ stoner/sludge regardess of what kind of access to drugs I have, it doesnt do alot either way to influence my listening choices
p1074
aVI don't smoke weed, but I can definitely see it enhancing certain albums that I already love. One that comes to mind is Boris' Amplifier Worship. 
p1075
aV[deleted]
p1076
aVI do! Been a fan since I first heard Melvins' Houdini in '93. I don't smoke weed and I love slow, crushing, sludgy metal!!
p1077
aVI've been Edge since I was 18 and stoner doom is my favorite. 
p1078
aVIf you have to be in an altered state of mind to enjoy a band, they're not a good band.
p1079
aVI've dabbled in drugs, but currently clean for a few months. Still love the shit out of doom &amp; stoner
p1080
aVNever smoked or drank in my life. I just dig the heaviness and some of the vocals.
p1081
aVIf the music is good enough, you won't need the drugs.
p1082
aVMe. Having said that, around Christmas I was listening to Dopesmoker and got inspired to go to my local headshop and get a bong, having not had any weed at all for about 2 years. I just needed a lie down for about 15 hours. It's not for me anymore. 
p1083
aVI have never tried weed, I honestly don't see a connection between listening to Doom/Stoner metal and smoking weed. 
p1084
aV[deleted]
p1085
aVI smoke maybe once a month, and usually never listen to doom while high. For me listening to some awesome stoner doom is more of a substitute to getting high haha
p1086
aVHere here!\u000a\u000aI really enjoy the riffs and the distortions that stoner doom offers.\u000a\u000aAs a bonus, it helps me cope better when I get a migraine. It really soothes me and it's the only thing I can do when I'm laying in a dark room with the window open for air, and in pain :)

p1102
aVBare with me here, but I've always wanted to hear I Want You (She's So Heavy) doomed up.  The chords are actually really doomy in the build up section.
p1103
aVKing Crimson's Starless. It's a long, depressing song already. I'm sure if the mellotron chords throughout the intro were replaced by heavy toned guitars  and the long weird instrumental section in the middle had 2 guitars dissonant harmonizing with each other it could be incredibly awesome

aVI'm a fan of slomatics, but to me estron as a whole just didn't have the same heaviness as some of their previous releases. Still had some cool tracks but what they put out on the Conan split will be at the top of my list for them.
p1126

aVCan't wait for the new album. Shame it probably won't be out this winter.
p1176
aVIt's always nice to find people who actually like *34.788%...Complete*. I'd definitely say it was a misstep/failure, and of course it marks the departure of Martin Powell (and thus the end of the 'classic' MDB era), but it's a very interesting sort of failure.\u000a\u000aGods I wish they'd find themselves a good violinist again though; I'm just not convinced by the use of it on the latest albums, though that could just be the way it all meshes with the rest of the music.
p1177
aVIt's definitely in my top 3 favorites from MDB. The other two are Songs Of Darkness, Words Of Light, and The Dreadful Hours. Their newer albums have some great tracks, but they're not albums I could stand the whole way through.
p1178
aVI think you can split My Dying Bride in to a number of distinct eras, each with their own particular fans; the albums people like most tend to be fairly sequential. For me, it's the three album run from *Turn Loose the Swans* to *Like Gods of the Sun*, with *Turn Loose...* perhaps being the best. I think it just hangs together as a total listening experience in a way none of their other albums quite manage; the slow build-up of intensity from Sear Me MCMXCIII through the next two tracks up until the doomdeath moments in The Snow in My Hand...so good.
p1179
aVMisstep maybe, but failure seems a little harsh. I prefer to call it an experiment.

p1250
aVThis track isn't but you can make an argument for the rest being doom.
p1251
aVEh, not really. It's more like 70's hard rock, bordering on 80's heavy metal at times. Retro sound, organ, and spooky themes do not a doom band make. 
p1252
aV&gt; Retro sound, organ, and spooky themes do not a doom band make. \u000a\u000aI think those factors put it close at least, but whatever.
p1253
aVlol no they dont. Lyrical themes don't make anything a genre, its all music. And Ghost's music is not doom metal in the slightest. Organ and a retro sound applies to many rock bands from the 70s. Doom metal has to be low and slow. 
p1254
aVLyrical themes can make a genre, death metal, punk, just to name a couple.
p1255
aVBut they don't make a genre. There's plenty of Death Metal bands that don't just sint about death, and there's definitely punk bands that don't sing about politics. Lyrics mean absolutely nothing when it comes to genres
p1256
aVYou said its "all music" and thats not entirely true as lyrics do play a part in genre defining. They aren't the entire thing, but they are part of the equation.
p1257
aVNope, not even a little.
p1258
aVYes even a little.
p1259
aVIt's okay, youre wrong. Lyrics dont make a genre at all. If Dead Kennedys sang about dragons and wizards, would they be power metal? If King Crimson sang about murder and gore, would they be death metal? If BB King sang about meth use and hate, would he be sludge metal? No because thatd be retarded.

It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the so-called AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars.  Two of the first published blues songs, "[Dallas Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Blues)" (1912) and "[Saint Louis Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_Blues_(song\u005c))" (1914), were 12-bar blues featuring the AAB structure. [W. C. Handy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._C._Handy) wrote that he adopted this convention to avoid the monotony of lines repeated three times.  The lines are often sung following a pattern closer to a [rhythmic talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_blues) than to a melody.\u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a^Interesting: [^Country ^blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_blues) ^| [^Blues ^rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_rock) ^| [^Rhythm ^and ^blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues) ^| [^St. ^Louis ^Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Blues) \u000a\u000a^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnw7vkg) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnw7vkg)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

aVWhats being sung and how its delivered are two entirely different things man. Youre saying that the lyrical content defines a genre. That just simply isnt true. 
p1263
aVHow we say things, and what we say often go hand in hand. I'm saying lyrics can help define a bands genre, but it is not the only thing. \u000a\u000aAre you saying lyrics have no value at all to an artist and their work?
p1264
aVWoah, when did I ever say that? Lyrics can have value, but music ultimately means more. Genres can have lyrics that are typical of them or stereotypical even, but the lyrics dont define the genre. 
p1265
aVI think we are kind of on the same page to be honest. Lyrics are not genre defining in and of itself (although I think parody/comedy music can mostly be defined by lyrical content alone), but CAN play a role in defining music genres along with the music itself. \u000a\u000aTo be fair this would be a much better discussion in person.

p1523
aVIt's not about how good it is, it's how you use it, and you used it damn good. I've actually been getting some good tones out of a POS 15W Line 6...\u000a\u000aCare to share what model of amp you got? 
p1524
aVIt's a Yamaha g150 iii head from the 80s running through an ampeg 8x10
p1525
aVI dig this. Especially around 10:15. I hope you dudes keep at it. My friend has been adamant about starting a doom two-piece... maybe it's time to actually do it haha. Thanks for the inspiration.
p1526
aVFucking do it!!! Just channel some dark energy and put yourselves out there.
p1527
aVThought you guys might dig this! Maybe you'll hate it. Either way, it picks up around 2:00. 
p1528
aV2 piece doom metal?! this is fucking sick.
p1529
aVWoah, thanks man.
p1530
aVdidn't care for the vocals but drums and bass tone are on point!
p1531
aVNo excuses for the vocals. Better on the recording.\u000aAnyway, the gibson grabber is rad!!
p1532
aVy'all need a guitar strictly for feed back. Not a single note played, just turn on the amp and let the guitar rest up against the speakers with feedback screaming for years and play over it. That would make all the rest's you play sound a billion times cooler, other than that very sick man! Keep on groovin!
p1533
aVAnd I disagree with one of the other comments here, I personally dig the vocals. Recording quality sucked, by I dig y'alls yelling. Again, keep on doing what y'all are doing, the more I listen the more I like it. 
p1534
aVWoaah, thank you. That's good to hear. Haha, want to play feedback guitar for us? 
p1535
aVOMbearer
p1536
aVHaha. Ill take that as a compliment. 
p1537
aVFucking sick. Drummers got chops
p1538
aVThis is pretty rad. I swear, 2-pieces will take over the world in a few years. Which one are you?
p1539
aVIts definitely easier to do. Although a really ripping guitar would be cool here and there... noone seems to have gear, and it seems impossible to find someone who has time to practice. I'm playing the drums.
p1540
aVCool that you're taking matters into your own hands by doing what you can no matter how minimal. That's pretty much what my brother and I are doing. What's the best way to follow your band?
p1541

p1542
aVDude, fucking love it. I play bass and dig seeing drum/bass duos like Om and Mors. What's the bassist tuned to? I'm trying to find a good low sound for doom but don't want it to get too muddy on the low end.
p1543
aVOh man. Best username. Ummm... good question. I believe he's in C standard... just low enough to be heavy while avoiding the koRn slap'n pop :)
p1544
aVStrings with higher tension seem to work better, I have a five string tuned up to C standard that sounds way clearer than a four string tuned down.
p1545
aVI'm the bassist in this band it's actually D standard
p1546
aVI like it. 
p1547
aVGlad to hear that. It's really cool to see that there are people who like what we're doing. Hopefully we can fully realize all of our creative ambitions.

p1549
aVThanks for the positive vibes, man o war. We like playing it!
p1550
aVdo you know what the pedals the bass player is using? my friend has a drum set and my guitar amp to play doom is too small to get  that low end to really rumble but i do have a bass and we want to mess around playing Om like material
p1551
aVBass player here. I'm running a dd-7, moog phaser, micro pog, pharoh fuzz, some Dunlop guitar wah pedal, and a fat sandwhich distortion \u000a
p1552
aVOmg that's what it was the Pharaoh
p1553
aVThe longer I listen, the more I dig it. Stellar work, guys. In my opinion, the two-piece doom setup has a simplicity that lacks for (almost) nothing.
p1554
aVWoah! Thank you. We try to think of ways to make ourselves sound more full while still having a lot of contrast throughout the song... Ending up as a two-piece is purely due to the circumstances by which it is made difficult to coordinate practicing, unless you live with one another. Plus it seems like every person we find that might fit well turns out to own no musical equipment. Fuck.
p1555
aVAwesome stuff, I can here some Om influence.
p1556
aVagreed, and i hear a little Melvins in the mix to. Sounds good.

p1595
aVI was at that show as well, the best part was how seemingly lawless it was there, I smoked 2 joints right in front of a security guard.
p1596
aVMaaaaaaaaan. I was losing my mind on edibles and wanted to smoke a joint I had, but it was a HUMONGOUS preroll that I got from a dispensary. I looked around and everyone around me had roaches or one-hitters or vape pens, so I thought it'd be too flagrant and ostentatious to rip this finger-sized Green Crack monstrosity.\u000a\u000aI MIGHT have been a little paranoid. Still, great show.

p1641
(lp1642
VFloor?  I love this band, but I never considered them doom.
p1643
aVSame goes for DOWN's Nola album\u000a
p1644
aVI don't think they truly got doomy until their last two EPs, but their discography is great regardless. 
p1645
aVYeah, Floor's sound is more on the Sludgy/ Stonery side of things. A little to upbeat for Doom in my opinion. Kyuss, Deep Purple and Blue Cheer can hardly be considered Doom either despite their ties with the genre. Nevertheless I think Decibel do a good job with their lists.
p1646
aVGreat list! I was surprised to see Earth on this list. I don't think of them as Doom.
p1647
aVI love this list not because it's totally accurate, but because there's a TON of stuff here I've never listened to before. So much to check out. 
p1648
aVAs much as I like the band and the album there is no way in hell Pallbearer's Foundations of Burden should be higher than Sorrow and Extinction. Swap the two and I feel they are roughly in the right spot. Time will do well for both albums though as I feel they are classic material, Sorrow was practically a classic offering as soon as it came out.
p1649
aVI agree, Sorrow and Extinction is a brilliant release. I suppose it's a bit hard placing Foundations' because it's so new, undeniably great though. I'm excited for Pallbearer's future, Pallbearer and YOB are killing it at the moment. 
p1650
aVmore yob, and should be higher on the list
p1651
aVThis list is bad.
p1652
aVNo Swallow the Sun? Those guys are masters of doom
p1653
aVHow did Goatsnake not make the list?
p1654
aVConsidering their criteria for doom in this case, no Neurosis either?
p1655
aVKyuss is on here? Okay...\u000a\u000a\u000aCalling dopesmoker Jerusalem dunno how I feel about that.\u000a\u000a\u000aEyehategod should be much higher on the list. Pallbearer shouldn't be higher than any of their albums.\u000a\u000aBands that are sadly missing: Acid King, Conan, Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine, Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats, High on Fire, Jex Thoth, Manilla Road, OM.\u000a\u000aWould've really liked to seen mention of Amebix and Sacrilege.
p1656
aVI guess 100 albums makes for a pretty big list to fill but 5 Black Sabbath Albums in the top 25 seems like a bit much
p1657
aVIt's one of those catch 22 situations because the importance of those albums can't be stressed enough, but in terms of list writing...it's a lot less interesting if you're obligated to add the biggest bands on the planet several times. Maybe they should have capped it at three album max for each artist but that would mean choosing between the first four Sab' albums! 
p1658
aVI guess its just personal preference but I feel Watching From A Distance should be a bit higher and Take As Needed For Pain could drop a few steps. Also, I don't really feel that type o is doom. I like them, but they feel out of place. 
p1659
aVType O Negative - Death Penalty (1996)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWTF?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: Guess they meant October Rust but dun goofed with Witchfinder General. And... no World Coming Down? Now, that's a shame...
p1660
aVSee also the epic typo that is...Celestial Season-Salad lovers \u000a\u000aYeah I'm not to sure who typed this up because I found it on a forum (had to flip the order so that the numbers displayed properly though) but there's a lot of typos. It could have originally been a member of the Decibel staff though.
p1661
aVI'll go ahead and throw my opinion out here --- Take subrosa off that list. I don't see Acid King on here at all. I don't see Cough. I don't see THOU. This list is garbage.
p1662
aVI'd like to see one of the post-reunion YOB albums on there too.
p1663
aVQuantum Mystic should've been their choice, the great cessation is kind of a snoozer, but I mean that in comparison to other YOB albums. Such a solid fucking band.

I think its absolutely awesome and I've listened to it quite a lot recently.\u000a\u000aThe two I mentioned above as well as The Great Cessation are my absolute favorites.\u000a\u000aIllusion of motion is pretty sweet too if you're looking for more. :P\u000a\u000aI'm going to a YOB concert near me in March and I'm SO pumped :D Check their tour locations to see if they'll drop by where you live.\u000a\u000aSorry, I'd describe the albums but I'm too stoned so this took me forever to type out on my phone lol. You'll just have to check them out or read some reviews. Enjoy this awesome band :P
p1703
aVYes catharsis is amazing. I have the re issue and the only diffence I can find is they made it louder. The original album you had to crank your plaer with the re issue you crank it and are in a doom heaven.
p1704
aV&gt;Some people think their newest one (Clearing the Path to Ascension) is their best one since Atma. I think its absolutely awesome and I've listened to it quite a lot recently.\u000a\u000aBecause Clearing the Path is their only album since Atma, it is also technically their worst :-p\u000a\u000a&gt;The two I mentioned above as well as The Great Cessation are my absolute favorites.\u000a\u000aGreat Cessation is my favorite also! Super dark, super evil, super heavy.\u000a\u000a&gt;I'm going to a YOB concert near me in March and I'm SO pumped :D Check their tour locations to see if they'll drop by where you live.\u000a\u000aBaltimore? \u000a
p1705
aVOh you're right about Clearing the Path and Atma, for some reason I thought there was something in between... XD And I'm from Canada :P
p1706
aVThey've pretty much been on an unstoppably good run since Catharsis, but if I had to rank their releases:\u000a\u000a1. Clearing The Path To Ascend\u000a\u000a2. Atma\u000a\u000a3. The Unreal Never Lived\u000a\u000a4. Catharsis\u000a\u000a5. The Illusion Of Motion\u000a\u000a6. The Great Cessation\u000a\u000a7. Elaborations Of Carbon\u000a\u000aI would definitely hit up Clearing and The Illusion Of Motion next, followed by The Unreal Never Lived (Quantum Mystic might be my favorite Yob opener). Also, they just dropped a remaster of Catharsis last year that sounds incredible...\u000a\u000a...Oh, who am I kidding? Get them all!
p1707
aVi love the new one, especially marrow. Atma is epic. Thats all ive really listened to actually. Need more yob,
p1708
aVIllusion of Motion? But I quite enjoy everything after Catharthis
p1709
aVI'm actually listening to Atma right now, but my favorites would have to be Clearing the Path to Ascend and The Great Cessation. 
p1710
aVI don't know how to choose! I am listening to The Unreal Never Lived right now though :o
p1711
aVIllusion of Motion for me
p1712

This album goes really well with the first part of Samsara, which is usually tough to get through.  I could make a nice mashup with sharp cuts and stuff, but it wouldn't add that much in my opinion. I highly recommend playing this while watching Samsara though, it's on netflix.

aVThis. I listen to all kinds of music. Mostly it's stoner/sludge/doom, but I too get sick of it from time to time and need a change.
p1736
aVi've a nice music collection of over 2000 LPs and all kinds of music from Abba to Zappa, i'm quite deep in it, anyway... especially the stoner doom bands formed around 2010 are more or less all the same, if its this band horsehunter, throne, monolord and so on, they are all some kind of a copy.
p1737
aVWell man, what can I say? I don't disagree. However if tell me and others in /r/doom what you are looking for and enjoy in stoner/doom/sludge bands, people will give recommendations. For me it's the likes of Church Of Misery, Stoned Jesus, Demonic Death Judge, Windhand or Major Kong with some extra grooviness and jammy feel, you might like something completely else.\u000a\u000aI can also link great lesser known bands from other genres, if you collect LPs and are into classics, you should enjoy [Blues Pills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh4Uw-W7I-4), to me it's Janis Joplin meets Jimi Hendrix with a little modern twist, the guitarist is just 19.\u000a

p1760
aVI believe the biggest one so far has been the new Elder release though I haven't listened to it yet. There's also the new Pentagram album in the works but besides that I've also been a bit out of the loop
p1761
aVThe new crypt sermon is probably my favorite release of the year so far. Also, the new Visigoth is very doom-y. I thought of them as being more of a traditional heavy metal band, but the new one is decidedly epic doom. They even cover Manila road. 
p1762
aVNew Doomraiser and Lord of Doubt are probably the best straight Doom albums to come out this year so far.\u000a\u000aThere's also a band on Shadow Kingdom records called Misty Grey that will either be hated or become a future classic. It's that divisive. I think it's great.

p1780
aVReally hope he gets it together. Not saying go totally clean. But stuff like meth... it really fucks you up. I love so much of the music this man has created. Saint Vitus is cool, but the Obsessed... Man, there are some awesome riffs he's wrote. Spirit Caravan is awesome, as well as a little supergroup known as Shrinebuilder. Recently, all I've been listening to is his solo acoustic album "Adrift." Really beautiful stuff on there, that album means a lot to me. So I really hope things take a turn for the better soon.

sVHey guys, releasing the first song off my new stoner/doom album, would love some feedback on it! [crosspost from /r/stonerrock]
p1868
(lp1869
VFeedback: The vocals are your most interesting part of the mix by FAR but are too quiet. The drumming is a big turnoff to me, way to much kick drumming and one-offs. Maybe you could try a looser more 'heavy' pace. I think it could synergize really well with the vocals instead of how the drum track is just doing its own thing. Also don't be afraid to try making your voice the driving force behind a song!
p1870
aVI totally agree-- I'd come back for the vocals. The instrumentation could be taken up a few notches, louder, heavier. Especially at the end; rather than a fade out, I wanted a quick ramp up and a really punchy finish. 
p1871
aVThanks dude, i'll polish up the tracks after i'm done with the rest of them! Thanks for listening!
p1872
aVThanks man! I'll keep it in mind when mixing future tracks!
p1873
aVHey, nice work! I felt like you paid some homage to the pioneers of the genre very well. Feedback? If I had to pick one thing it would be the mix of the song, it felt a little flat to me. I can offer no solution to my feedback but there ya have it :)\u000a\u000aOkay, two things: the voice intro really struck me as having been played out over the years.\u000a\u000aOther than that keep it up! I didn't click through to the social media so maybe the answer to this question is there, but who's in the band?
p1874
aVits just me man, haha.. bedroom musician! Thanks for the feedback and listening..\u000a\u000aI would agree with the mixing i guess, seeing how i don't really know what i'm doing and just doing it by ear. But am learning more stuff as i go so the tracks should start sounding better hopefully! \u000a\u000aAnd the voice intro bit was something that inspired the song so stuck it on there just as an homage! \u000a\u000aAnyways thanks again, i will be releasing more tracks soon, you can like the facebook page if you want, will probably update it there and will  be posting it on reddit too so no worries!
p1875
aVHere's my 2 cents: Drums sound too thin, especially bass drum needs more beef, low end. Guitar tone isn't really good either in my opinion, and bass lacks low end and general heaviness really badly. The strongest element is vocals in my opinion, sound quite original.\u000a\u000aAll in all it ain't bad, I liked it overall, just needs polishing. Don't want my input looking like bashing or anything, I listened twice and upvoted. Just trying to give some constructive criticism.\u000a\u000aEdit: Also, if you're interested I can try recording heavier bass track next week.
p1876
aVHey man thanks for the feedback! I actually passed just the guitar track to another redditor who was kind enough to offer rerecording the drums, if you want i can pass you his track when he is done if you are keen.. PM me for sure with your preference!\u000a\u000a
p1877
aVNice! I'd prefer it with drums done, as bass should pretty much follow drumming. I'm waiting for an effect to be delivered anyway. Just don't forget about me when it's done!
p1878
aVCheers mate! Thanks again!
p1879
aVYeah, there's definitely something off with the mix.\u000aI'm an engineer, I'd be happy to help you polish this up a bit if you want.

A few quick questions though if you don't mind.\u000a\u000aDo you have someone else playing drums or did you also record the drums? \u000a\u000aWould you mind sharing what pedals and effects you use? I'm digging that reverb/delay sound and am in the market for pedals.

p2012
aVCool dude! I knew there had to be some similar stuff out there, got anything recorded?
p2013
aVJust a few demos so far, we're trying to get a few songs together and release an Ep in the next month or so, when we're finished I'll be sure to post it here! The drums/bass combo feels really natural for doom metal doesn't it? It's a really cool sound 
p2014
aVYeah for sure man! I didn't really set out for a particular sound, I think it just ended up doomy because it's an octave lower than what people are used to haha, I like the freedom involved in playing with a two piece. 
p2015
aVThere's a lot of freedom in duos, I've played in 4 or 5 man bands for most of my life so it's a nice change.I usually play in drop D tuning as well. Our jams are usually a bit slower and heavier then yours, sorta like an Asphyx/Uncle Acid cross.

aVListen to the albums Pentagram (AKA Relentless), First Daze Here: The Vintage Collection and Day Of Reckoning. Three great albums, all recorded quite differently. Sadly, the rest of Pentagram's albums aren't really worth listening to. But those three albums make up for it.
p2070
aV100% agree. Those albums are the reason Pentagram is one of my favorite bands. Most of their post-80s stuff isn't that great.
p2071
aVI may be a bit biased here but the rest is worth listening to. Not really Show 'em How, that's probably the weakest. But the others definitely have their hits and still hold up, if not AS good. I think the one problem is they went through so many musical changes 70's 80's and 90's that they were hard to pin down, but every album has its own merit, from the hard rocking 70's to the demented sub basement. Even Last Rites is pretty good, I just don't like how its produced too much

aVHaha. Musically I wasn't trying to do any NOLA tributes at all, but lyrically the vocalist may have been going for that. It originally had harsher Crowbar type vocals which got toned down because I didn't want that for this song. I was thinking more Maryland doom (Earthride, Blood Farmers, etc) meets Sleep here.

aVI can not wait to see them in Philly.  Sleep came here, over the summer, and I'm seeing Mayhem in a few weeks at the same venue.  The Union Transfer has been getting such good bands, lately.  And they don't seem to frisk you, there, either.

aVNot to mention it's an incredible venue and every time I've been there the sound has been on point.
p2107
aVLast time I was there, with Windhand and Sleep, you couldn't get right up against the stage.  The mix just completely broke down, in that area.  Anywhere else was awesome, though.  Probably my favorite venue, currently.

p2111
aVWhat's wrong with Neumo's? I live in Arizona and was considering flying out to that show. Would I be better off going to a different show on the tour?
p2112
aVIt's not terrible, but the sound isn't great, the staff tend to be assholes, drinks are expensive, and it's pretty much impossible to find parking in that neighborhood. (Take the bus if you can.)\u000a\u000aThe real problem, though, is that almost every "hip" band from out of town gets booked there. I lived in Seattle for about 10 years and I can't tell you how many shows I saw there. Sick of it.
p2113
aVi have to push back against soy_reindeer. neumos is awesome. they have one of the best sound systems in seattle, book a wide range of acts, and their staff is comparable to any other venue in the area. parking is a bitch, but no one really expects to find decent parking in seattle. its kind of a bitchy complaint. loudest show i've ever seen was there, the melvins with jello biafra. ear bleeding loud. ive also seen some killer electronic shows there, too- autechre and plaid were probably the best. if i was to pick any venue to see electric wizard, it would be neumos.
p2114
aVFair enough, but I'm hardly the only person to make those complaints: http://www.yelp.com/biz/neumos-crystal-ball-reading-room-seattle.\u000a\u000aI see the same thing across my friends, though-- some people are really sick of Neumo's and others don't mind it. So maybe we just fall on opposite sides of the spectrum.\u000a\u000aI bought a ticket to the show today, anyway, so I must not hate it *that* much...

aVI'm glad to hear this because I went ahead and bought a ticket. I don't give a shit about parking or a metal band being too loud. In fact, I want to hear that shit as loud as possible.

(lp2154
VFrom a moment ago:\u000a\u000a&gt; Hi! Thanks for your kind words. Don't worry guys, Church of Misery NEVER gonna stop. I NEVER give up this band. As you know well, I wrote all songs &amp; lyrics of Church of Misery. I already have new many materials for next album. Hopefully, we will enter the studio when we got new guys. Next year, you can hear our new album and play in your country ( Europe, America etc ) again! I swear!\u000a\u000a&gt; TATSU MIKAMI\u000a\u000aGreat to see that.
p2155
aVFuck, that's really bad news! Tatsu changed guitarists often, but now the whole band basically broke up.\u000a\u000aJJ was a pillar along with Tatsu, I love his style and groove (told him he's my favourite drummer just 3 months ago at a gig in Poland). \u000a\u000aHideki is an awesome and original vocalist, also added a lot to the band's sound, he sang on the last 3 studio albums, he's also a great showman. \u000a\u000aIkuma Kawabe arguably contributed the least to the sound of the band, but is a good guitarist that fitted the band just fine.\u000a\u000aI'm glad I got to see them with JJ and Hideki. [Here's a pic of us with Mika Komine](http://i.imgur.com/k7Rqq3e.jpg), Tatsu's gf and their merch person.
p2156
aVI saw this on FB.  I'll admit I'm not ultra familiar with the band's output but I've really enjoyed what I heard.  I mean, with only one member left the band have essentially broken up.  That's a real shame, what a great band.  Even if they continue to record under the Church name, a new vocalist, guitarist AND drummer mean they'll practically be a different band.  I know it's not the first time they've had significant lineup changes though.
p2157
aVNot really.  Their bassist is the only original member, if I recall correctly, and he does most of the writing.  They've been through tons of lineup changes, and have retained more or less the same style.  
p2158
aVThat's true. That said JJ (Junji Narita) has been the drummer for 14 years now and Hideki sang on the last 3 albums. The live line-up changed and there was a new guitarist every couple of years, but the sound will completely change now.\u000a\u000aTatsu writes all the material so the riffs will be there, but the rest is unknown. The new album is going to be different for sure, let's hope for the best.
p2159
aVYeah, but a vocalist is a pretty major thing to change.  I know they've had  different vocalists in the past, but it's still a pretty major change.  I'll be surprised if they come out the other side of side sounding exactly the same as they did before.
p2160
aVI hope they go back to using cleaner vocals, like on the Early Works comp.  I like the sound of the newer albums, with Houses Of The Unholy being my favorite, but I really like their earlier vocal work.

p2228
aVInteresting, I've never really thought of Agalloch as much of a doom band (more black metal), but you're right, there are some pretty doomy tracks. Thanks!

aVMurder By Death - Who Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them? Not doom musically, more outlaw country/rock. It's hard to classify. BUT: it's a concept album about the devil going drinking in a small town out in the desert. As the sun rises and he gets up to leave some asshole shoots him in the back. The townspeople bottle and sell his blood, just really kick him when he's down, so the album is about the devil's revenge on the town. Plagues, zombies eating school kids, water turns to blood, etc. none are safe, none are innocent, Hell breaks loose. I can't recommend this album enough, honestly. I'd link to it, but I'm on mobile, sorry.

aVGentry Densley from Eagle Twin does something similar ... I don't think his guitar is as low-tuned as a Bass VI, but the bi-amped rig with gain pedals into the guitar amp definitely will work. They have an enormous live sound for a two-piece. 
p2314
aVPretty sure the girl from Mares of Thrace uses a baritone guitar stereo'd into a bass amp and an Orange guitar amp. Sounds pretty big. It's something I've thought about playing with myself. 
p2315
aVWow, they are really good, never heard them before.  I'm already doing a rig like that, with the low clean(er) sound going into a 2x15 and the higher sound going into a 4x10 with fuzz.  I just wondered how one of these would sound with it.  I think I'm definitely going to get one now.  I'll post a clip of my band with it when I get it.

aVLately I\u2019ve been contemplating playing bass melodies over drones by using an EXH Freeze pedal in the effects loop of a Deluxe Memory Boy (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjFth1mg5Rc).

aVIts just a lot to digest. That list must have been near enough an album per day maybe excluding weekends. I can't concentrate on work and listen to music at the same time, not that my work allows for that anyway, but I wouldn't have been able to do both simultaneously.

aVSurprised these weren't listed yet:\u000a\u000a\u000aSea of Bones - The World Wants Us Dead\u000a\u000aBongripper - Miserable\u000a\u000aThe Body - I Shall Die Here\u000a\u000aThe Body &amp; Thou - Released From Love (yes, I know it's an EP)
p2362
aVBongripper and The Body were just shy of making it to my top ten, but definitely worth a mention.
p2363
aVHaven't seen [**Conan - Blood Eagle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-of5C1OHX_8) in this thread yet, was the dark horse for me this year.
p2364
aVHoly shit, Blood Eagle. I was stoned the first time I heard this album and my speakers were cranked up. It tripped me up, I felt like I was being nailed onto my chair, each minute more pleasurable than the previous one. The shit's VERY heavy, especially the first song Crown of Talons - I like playing it on my bass.
p2365
aVBlood Eagle proved that they're the heaviest band on the planet. 
p2366
aVYou mean Conan?  Blood Eagle was the name of the album.

p2369
aVNo, he meant Blood Eagle, because it proved they're the heaviest band on the planet.
p2370
aVDid their live album come out in 2014?  And do live albums count?  Because... it's awesome too...
p2371
aV[deleted]
p2372
aVJust an EP, but this [Mournful Congregation - Concrescence of the Sophia](http://youtu.be/1uh9ymBRy14) is delightful.
p2373
aVOne of my favorites (MC) of all time \u005cm/
p2374
aV**Slomatics - Estron** is a straight SLUMPER.  Hit me right in the doom pouch.\u000a\u000a**Electric Wizard - Time to Die** felt like a bit of a return to form for my personal E-Wiz tastes and I enjoyed it.\u000a\u000a**Monolord - Empress Rising** Oh yeah\u000a\u000a
p2375
aVYour list is mine, but I'd add Eyehategod's self titled and Down's latest EP. 
p2376
aVSweet, thanks for the backup.  I'll give those albums a whirl.
p2377
aVStickied.
p2378
aVIm being really unoriginal here, bit YOB really takes the cake
p2379
aVyeah I fully agree, YOB always deliver but Clearing the Path was really special \u000a

p2383
aVHow about a little love for [Descend Into Despair "The Bearer of All Storms"](http://domesticgenocide.bandcamp.com/album/the-bearer-of-all-storms)? Funeral doom double album, and free. 
p2384
aV1. Bongripper \u2013 Miserable\u000a2. Monolord \u2013 Empress Rising (Would be number 1 if I couldn\u2019t hear a vacuum tube rattling in a few places).\u000a3. Holy Serpent \u2013 Holy Serpent\u000a4. Electric Wizard \u2013 Time to Die\u000a5. Godflesh \u2013 A World Lit Only By Fire\u000a6, Dopelord - Black Arts, Riff Worship, &amp; Weed Cult\u000a7.

p2386
aVThe doom that made my year end list that I feel are actually worth voting for (if this is a vote... I'm not sure):\u000a\u000aPallbearer - Foundations of Burden\u000a\u000aWijlen Wij - Coronachs Of The \u03a9\u000a\u000aThou - Heathen
p2387
aVAnd if I'm being fair I should give Coffinworm the credit they deserve for IV.I.VIII. It's a ridiculously tough spot to be in coming off as strong a first album as When All Became None was, and to release something that is probably on par with the quality of the first release says a lot about how good of a band they actually are.
p2388
aVMy top 10 would be:\u000a\u000a1. Pilgrim - II: Void Worship\u000a2. Witch Mountain - Mobile of Angels\u000a3. Slug Lord - Transmutation\u000a4. Occultation - Silence in the Ancestral House\u000a5. Electric Wizard - Time to Die\u000a6. The Well - Samsara\u000a7. Purple Hill Witch - Purple Hill Witch\u000a8. Mount Salem - Endless\u000a9. Blues Pills - Blues Pills (Occult/retro rock)\u000a10. Brimstone Coven - Brimstone Coven (Occult rock)
p2389
aVThat Mount Salem album is decent but i find the songs kinda sound the same after a while. The Tower is sick though\u000a
p2390
aVAny list without Salem's Pot - ...lurar ut dig på prärien is a bad list.\u000a\u000aOther than that: Yob, Bongripper, Slomatics, Monolord and stuff I'm forgetting/for another sub.
p2391
aVIndian in the top spot for me. I also like the Coffinworm and Serpentine Path records from this year. Lord Mantis. I feel like I missed a lot though, so hopefully people will post some good stuff in here for me to check out.
p2392
aVMonolord's Empress Rising was quite good. Classic stoner fuzz.
p2393
aVmonolord empress rising
p2394
aVPilgrim - II: Void Worship
p2395
aVOnes that I liked:\u000aMount Salem - Endless\u000aSatan's Satyrs - Die Screaming\u000aBlues Pills - Blues Pills (more occult/retrorock)\u000aElectric Citizen - Sateen (more occult/retrorock)
p2396
aVIn no particular order...\u000a\u000a1. [Primitive Man/Fister split](https://primitivemandoom.bandcamp.com/album/split-12-with-fister)\u000a2. Electric Wizard - Time to Die\u000a3. Conan - Blood Eagle\u000a4. Bongripper - Miserable\u000a5. Indian - From All Purity\u000a6. Coffinworm - IV.I.VIII
p2397
aVThat split is awesome. "Life Is Short Life Is Shit And Soon It Will Be Over" is slowly becoming one of my favorite songs of the year. The video Kenny did for it's pretty cool, too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcTp8UPeAfg
p2398
aVTop 9 in order \u000a\u000a* 1) Satan's Satyrs - Die Screaming \u000a* 2) Electric Wizard - Time to Die\u000a* 3) Opium Warlords - Taste My Sword of Understanding\u000a* 4) Moss - Carmilla (Marcilla) / Spectral Visions\u000a* 5) Serpent Warning - Serpent Warning\u000a* 6) Monolord - Empress Rising \u000a* 7) Below - Across the Dark River\u000a* 8) Dread Sovereign - All Hell's Martyrs\u000a* 9) Salem's Pot - ...Lurar ut dig på prärien\u000a
p2399
aVListened to Thou for the first time today. So good. 
p2400
aVStill think that Saiga made a great record that gone under the rader.\u000aCheck it out: http://saigarocks.bandcamp.com/
p2401
aVSome of these are not 100% doom, but whatever. My top 10 doom albums are:\u000a\u000a1) Godflesh - "A World Lit Only By Fire"\u000a\u000a2) Earth - "Primitive and Deadly"\u000a\u000a3) Sunn O))) &amp; Scott Walker - "Soused"\u000a\u000a4) Triptykon - "Melana Chasmata"\u000a\u000a5) Yob - "Clearing The Path To Ascend"\u000a\u000a6) Boris - "Noise"\u000a\u000a7) Megaton Leviathan - "Past 21: Beyond The Arctic Cell"\u000a\u000a8) [Asilo - "Comunión"](http://asilo.bandcamp.com/album/comuni-n) (gotta support my local Argentinian scene)\u000a\u000a9) Kuolemanlaakso - "Tulijoutsen"\u000a\u000a10) Bong - "Stoner Rock" (very misleading title; it's actually drone doom)\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aMy top 5 of all genres would be:\u000a\u000a1) Darkspace - "Dark Space III I"\u000a\u000a2) Godflesh - "A World Lit Only By Fire"\u000a\u000a3) Earth - "Primitive And Deadly"\u000a\u000a4) 6v6 - "Le Cri Des Corbeaux"\u000a\u000a5) Lana Del Rey - "Ultraviolence"
p2402
aVGodflesh was fucking incredible. Holy hell. Streetcleaner with an even bigger steamroller.
p2403
aVYeah, I couldn't believe it when I first listened to it. RUMBLE.
p2404
aVHah, I'd have to say Lana's new album was my favorite this year.  Glad to see it make an appearance here.
p2405
aVHeh, I was surprised myself to like her so much. I started listening to her in january, later the new album came out and I liked it even more than the previous ones.
p2406
aVLittle bit of everything but doom always comes out on top. \u000a\u000a1) Thou - Heathen\u000a\u000a2) Against Me!  - Transgender Dysphoria Blues \u000a\u000a3) Wild Beasts - Present Tense \u000a\u000a4) Earth - Primitive and Deadly \u000a\u000a5) Scott Walker &amp; Sunn O))) - Soused \u000a\u000a6) Iceage - Plowing into the Field of Love\u000a\u000a7) Inter Arma - The Cavern\u000a\u000a8) Run the Jewels - RTJ2\u000a\u000a9) Mastodon - Once More Round The Sun \u000a\u000a10) The Atlas Moth - The Old Believer

asVJust found out about these guys from Chicago. A mix of psych, doom, and stoner. No EP, but their demos are pretty good.
p2418
(lp2419
VThese guys sound legit, can't wait to hear some more. 
p2420
aVSame here.  I'm seeing them live at Reggie's next week, and I hope they play these songs and hopefully some others.
p2421
aVThey are also playing with Karma to Burn, Sierra, and Hypnochron next Thursday at the Red Line Tap!  Gonna be awesome.
p2422
aVThese are pretty impressive for demos. I'd love to hear more!
p2423
aVThanks for the tip! These guys were completely off my radar.
p2424
aVNo problem!  I didn't hear about them til just recently. I didn't even know there were any bands of this style floating around Chicago (it feels like there's only mostly punk, garage, indie, and metalcore around here).  I mean, there's Bongripper, but they're waaaaaay more doomy than these guys.   
p2425
aVThere's local metal shows at Cobra Lounge regularly. Check it out.  In fact there's a pretty vibrant metal scene in the Chi, bud. \u000a\u000aBlue Dream is another very underground hard psych band. Young kids that look like Mott The Hoople on stage.  Saw them at Metro a couple weeks ago. Good shit. 
p2426
aVOh yes, I'm quite familiar with Cobra.  I know Eyehategod played there a few times in the last year, and I think Weedeater played there as well.  And now I'm hearing about other places, too.  \u000a\u000aWow, Blue Dream sounds amazing!  Thanks for telling me about them.  Another band I like, though not from Chicago, but close by, is Radio Moscow.  It just goes to show that Iowa can churn out good bands besides just Slipknot lol.  
p2427
aVGood call on Radio Moscow. Parker Griggs is a neo-guitar god. \u000a\u000a*edit*\u000a\u000aCheck out Blues Pills if you like the RM vibe. It's some former members, with a french chick on vox and a swede guitar player. Killer boogie/blues-rock. 
p2428
aVI hear this often from Chicago people. Y'all have got plenty of great bands in the area. I guess there just isn't a venue for this style of music to play live?
p2429
aVMy bad, I was actually referring to the underground/DIY scene, which has practically no bands like this circulating.  I've heard of some local acts like Killer Moon, Oceans of Titan, and Hypnochron that play at more legit venues, but I don't think there's any staples for stoner and doom metal (like St. Vitus Bar in NYC).  
p2430
aVMount Salem is another band from the area that seems to play some relatively larger shows.\u000a\u000aI just found Hypnochron over Christmas break, crushing!
p2431
aVWow, didn't know about Mount Salem til you told me. I love it! Kinda reminds me of the Tony Martin era of Black Sabbath.  Which, in my opinion, is a very underrated part of the band's history.\u000a\u000aAlso, there's another Chicago band called Witchbanger that's pretty rad.  
p2432
aVThere's actually a lot of good Chicago doom out there, though most of it is independent and underground. Doom acts here get to play a fair amount of venues, but unless you're Sleep the biggest venue for doom here is probably Reggie's Rock Club. Make sure to check out Bongripper if you haven't!\u000a\u000aThis seems like a good thread to plug my site in... if you're interested in the Chicago doom metal scene, check out the  [ Chicago Doom Confederacy](http://www.chicagodoomconfederacy.com).
p2433
aVWe have shit tons of venues. This kid just hasn't had a chance to find them yet. Even though we don't have a joint that claims its a "Doom Bar" in some overpriced hipster burrough doesn't mean we're lacking for entertainment here. There are tons of places to go that support metal, although punk does tend to get a bit more visibility. But that's just because of the history of the city. This has been a largely street punk / skinhead dominated scene for decades. Even east coast hardcore bands were afraid to play here due to the violence. The punk mentality is sort of ingrained. 
p2434
aVI just recently learned that some good venues for doom have been Double Door and the Subterranean (which is so close to DD).  I already knew about Cobra Lounge, though I didn't know they had so many doom acts come through.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, I've always heard stories about Chicago's punk roots.  I have quite a few friends who are followers of the recent punk scene, and from what they say it seems like there's a never-ending supply of booze and basement shows.  Now THAT is what I call preservation!  
p2435
aVDD and SubT are both good. Empty Bottle is probably the best place for amazing shit that still hasn't quite come to the attention of the masses. 
p2436
asVThe Well - Mortal Bones
p2437
(lp2438
sVSleep - Dragonaut (Banjo Cover)
p2439
(lp2440
VIt's a guitar set up like a banjo. If he could actually play it on a real banjo then I'd be pretty impressed. Not a bad cover though.
p2441
aVi do play the 5 string and im going to see if this is possible
p2442
aVplease please please! I'd love some banjo tabs. Maybe we can work on it together? or any of the electric wizard banjo tabs! lets do it! PM me?
p2443
aVThe thought of something like the riff to I Am Nothing being angrily plucked out on a banjo is killing me \u000a\u000aPlease do it 
p2444

p2445
aVThat was awesome! Dude's got a killer voice too
p2446
aVheaviest banjo this side of the 'sip

p2449
aV[deleted]
p2450
aV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
p2451
aVwow he even did the preverb effect thing or whatever you call that
p2452
aVReverb?
p2453
aVyeah but it comes before... a "pre-reverb" if you will
p2454
aVThat's hard to watch
p2455
aVThis is fantastic. Anyone know any more stuff like this? As in like bluesy music with doom metal sensibilities.
p2456
aVNot that I really know, but it seems like this guy does more covers on his banjo. You could browse his YouTube channel. \u000a\u000aHis name is Joseph Winiarski\u000a\u000aI'm enjoying his videos.
p2457
aVFreakwater did a bluegrass cover of Warpigs. 
p2458
aVNot quite what I was looking for, but this is really cool.
p2459
aVHere's an acoustic guitar and ukulele cover of Dragonaut. They did some other songs too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5HEXKtUK18
p2460
aVFucking awesome.
p2461
aVi expected to be more... banjoey sounding?
p2462
asVDeep Purple - Fools (proto-doom) - [8:11]
p2463
(lp2464
Vgood call! Thats some old school occult sounding Doom. I honestly can't say I have listened to even 1/4th of Deep Purples songs.... that changes today, thanks for the suggestion.
p2465
aVI've always thought this song was really heavy / doomy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bZ_hMvACYo
p2466
aVthese riffs sound like they belong on an old Clutch Album, lol.
p2467
aVYou're welcome! To be honest, this isn't too representative of their other work, but there is plenty of good music in their catalog. The band had no shortage of talented musicians! I'll go for anything with Ian Gillan's godly vocals. A classic: [Child in Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfAWReBmxEs)
p2468
aVWhen a Blindman Cries - heard a live version of that and thought how angst ridden and doomy that sounded. Love that band!
p2469
asVMARS RED SKY - Strong Reflection
p2470
(lp2471
VSo good. I love this band. 
p2472
aVDat bass intro ... so good
p2473
aVThese guys did a split with Year of No Light. It's worth checking out.
p2474
aVAmazing track. None of their other stuff has quite lived up to this for me, though it's all fairly solid. \u000a\u000aWhere are they from? France?
p2475
aVThey're from France, yeah. And I agree, this is the best track I've heard from them, by a mile. The rest of their tends to meander, and doesn't have that same punch.
p2476
asVNEVER listen to Sunn O))) whilst jogging.
p2477
(lp2478
VYes, Sunn 0)) is bad running music, however on the plus side you GOT Sunn 0)). j/k I wouldn't say I LOVE Sunn 0)) but it is mood and time specific. For example I have Sunn 0)) on right now but its pitch dark out, I just got up, I don't want to wake the wife and dogs but want something to listen to, that I don't want to sing to, just kinda zone out whilst drinking my coffee and peruse the internet. If you decide to give Sunn 0)) another shot, go see them live. Even people I know that don't like Sunn 0)) that see them live say its an experience you NEED TO HAVE. Bring earplugs.
p2479
aVSweet mother of fuck. My brother took me to a Sunn 0))) without every hearing them before. They spent a solid 45 minutes loading the venue with fog and after one song I thought I was going to vibrate out of my shoes and started having heart palpitations. 10/10 would see again.
p2480
aVSounds like every Sunn O))) show I've been to, but still not a fan.
p2481
aVYour a pussy.
p2482
aVIt was like a bad acid trip, usually if music doesn't fit the time and place it just doesn't but that was really jarring haha. I know what you mean though Sunn O))) are pretty rad but you really need to be in the mood. I'd love to see them live.
p2483
aVthat sounds sweet, listening to Sunn O))) in the morning with coffee, what tracks would you recommend ?
p2484
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR1KfKXH6s\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I5VyG3OOm8\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXdsiHtrROA\u000a\u000aThese are a few of my favorite songs\u000aThis is my Favorite Alum\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXdsiHtrROA\u000a\u000a
p2485
aVthanks man! looking forward to checking that out in the morning tomorrow, been wondering where to start with them for a long while now.
p2486
aVEarth is highly recommended as well. Associated act to the band though are Kahnate and Gravetemple. MOSS is worth noting as well.
p2487
aVDon't stop with them, check out Boris too, check out their album amplifier worship, it's a masterpiece
p2488
aVIt Took The Night To Believe is arguably atypical of their sound though. To me, Richard is a better example of 'what they do'.
p2489
aV&gt;that sounds sweet, listening to Sunn O))) in the morning with coffee, what tracks would you recommend ?\u000a\u000aI see your point how ever "It took the night to believe" is one of my personal favorite Sunn 0))) tracks. Throwing down the youtube link for that one was like a reflex. \u000a\u000a"Arguably" is it A-typical? Sure. Does the track convey mood, tone, feeling, depth, overall "menacing nature" of Sunn 0)))  Yes it does. I would argue to say its worth checking out to explore the "range" of the bands spectrum as a whole.
p2490
aVI hear you on the reflex action. Sunn O))) def have a wide range of stuff in their discog in any case! It Took The Night To Believe almost has a black metal feel to it, for me. ANyhoo, hopefully your links do help the guy get into them :D
p2491
aVI'll be honest , I read your response and said out loud "What the fuck is this guy talking about!?!?" Thinking about it and reading your response ... I get it and see your point. Totally and completely accurate. 
p2492
aV NAH, Sunn is trance-inducing, and I want to run as long as possible so I think it's great. If not Sunn, listen to Sleep's DS
p2493
aV"Proceed the weedian Nazareth"\u000a\u000aMe: Takes hit and goes back to work.\u000a\u000aStoner Metal and drone metal is surprisingly productive work music for me for some weird reason.
p2494
aVAgreed. At work my boss and I listen to stoner doom and drone all day, and get shit done way better than when we don't.\u000a\u000aWe seem to focus on Sleep, Pallbearer, Sabbath and uncle Acid.
p2495
aVThat sounds like a really gnarly playlist, your boss is awesome. 
p2496
aVThis is so true, I have a friend who listens to Stoner while she studies because it's relaxing as fuck.
p2497
aVI see it that when you are working you go into organic brain mode and the conscious fades so the subconscious takes over. Stoner and Drone massage those brain waves to keep them going. Kind of like getting a continuous leg massage while jogging.
p2498
aVAnd it's fantastic once you get in that zone. 
p2499
aVThe Misfits, particularly We Are 138, is good to jog to. 
p2500
aVI second this. Though I've never listened to much Misfits, Trivium did a cover of this song on their new album and the first time I heard it was while I was running. It was fantastic!
p2501
aVsunn is terrible running music, but EXCELLENT lifting music.  there's something really synergistic about crushing tones and trying to NOT get crushed or damaged by heavy objects.\u000a\u000athat said, once i listened to sunn (i think black 1) in the atlanta airport and it made me so ill i had to sit down for 20 minutes.
p2502
aVI listen to drone when I'm in chill mode, it helps me relax. IMO the best running/workout music is thrash or hardcore
p2503
aVAs a martial artist I find Folk and Sludge the best to get me in the mood.\u000aNothing like throwing off a few snap kicks to High on Fire.\u000a\u000a
p2504
aVHahaha, Furywhip. Thats all I can think of when snap kick + HOF.
p2505
aVI'm big on atmospheric black metal and death metal when I run and lift. 
p2506
aVI was walking alone to school one day a while ago whilst listening to 'O))) Bow 2', it was cold, dark, and snowy, and I almost collapsed out of minor fear when those goddamn [bells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viGEDten7NE#t=394) started.
p2507
aVthose fucking "Bow" tracks get me every time. I start listening to Flight of the Behemoth with the expectation of it just being guitars (forgetting the changes later on), and then nearly jump out of my skin in surprise when Merzbow's bullshit shows up. 
p2508
aVThat sounds like good running music to me.
p2509
aVI love jogging to Sunn O))), it means I can set my own pace instead of trying to copy the pulse of the music... since there is no pulse to them.
p2510
aVYeah I imagine Sunn wouldn't make very good running music, it does however make somewhat decent night cycling music, and if you're not easily spooked amazing night hike music.
p2511
aVive seen them (2007) and will be seeing them again at a festival next year -- i cannot wait to experience that again 
p2512
aVI probably saw them in '05 or so in a tiny legion hall where the PA started to smoke with the opener (about 14 mos after the Station Night club disaster and we were probly 45 mins from there) so I got drug out by my shirt when my buddy noticed it. ANYWAY. Sunn 0))) was just surreal. I was mostly sober. I had a few beers but no drugs. The fog, the robes, the claustrophobia , and distance made me nauseous. I had never seen a band more dedicated to their "gimmick" but it was so interesting and dramatic. It was easily 10 mins between the time they took the stage and  when they started playing. Seemed like an hour. Just standing there. Once the guitar came up, the fog cleared enough to make out shadowy ominous figures. The volume was staggering. I mean it was a gross abuse of capability . I've seen some loud ass shows. Sunn 0)))   was up there as one of the loudest. I mean not only could I feel it, but it affected my vision and sense of balance. I could literally see the paneling on the walls shaking. So intense.
p2513
aVSaw Sunn0))) in 2002 on the same bill as the Ex and !!! (think about that for a second) at the Empty Bottle in Chicago. Single loudest and most amazing set I've ever seen. Every guitar strum literally lifted me off the floor. 
p2514
aVIt's hard to video them as the camera shakes \u000a\u000aI've had my eyeballs vibrate at noise/drone shows 
p2515
aVWooden Shjips is my go to jogging/running music, also some Lumerians. \u000aI used to run exclusively to OM, but the BPM is a little low. Dopesmoker is a good one too since it's half of 180bpm.\u000a\u000aDoes anyone else here run on a regular basis?

asVELI5: Why does everyone hate on Ghost (Ghost B.C) so much?
p2587
(lp2588
VThe main argument I hear is whether or not Ghost is "metal". I say who cares? Stop being genre queens. They're basically Blue Oyster Cult with a KISS image, and you know what? It's fun. 
p2589
aVI've also heard they put on an amazing live show.
p2590
aVThey put on an amazing show! They're much heavier live. 
p2591
aVI can second this.  They were great when I saw them in Atlanta.
p2592
aVCan confirm. 
p2593
aVThey're quite musical and accessible compared to a lot of bands who play and sing about similar themes and thus they're popular with quite a wide audience. Of course a lot of people have trouble dealing with popular bands and claim that they're not being trve metal.\u000a\u000aBut who gives a fuck really? They're top. 
p2594
aVI really didn't like ghost at first. At times they sound really doomy, and then poppy at other times. Especially the singer. It took a lot of listens to really get into them. I guess I just adjusted to the pop factor. I also like how lyrically they sound a lot like Venom, but take an organized religion approach to the overt tongue-in-cheek satanism. I'm not really a fan of the second album though, maybe I just need to listen to it more. 
p2595
aVI love that band until the vocals kick in. 
p2596
aVReally? I think he has a fantastic voice. One of the few clean vocalists I like. 
p2597
aV100% agree
p2598
aVI certainly don't hate Ghost, so I can't speak for anyone that does, and I'm certainly fine with the idea of them. It's just that for me, they aren't anything special. Instrumentally, they're just kinda eh. Their riffs aren't very original and there isn't much for me to grab onto. The hooks are pretty catchy for sure, but that's not enough alone sell them for me. Again, I don't hate them but I don't seek out listening to them on my own.
p2599
aVSame for me, there's just nothing for me to grab on to with them, especially with their second album. I also really dislike their cover of the Roky Erickson tune
p2600
aVGood music is subjective. They just seem to vastly polarize people. I love them, musically they are okay. Its the image and the theatrics I love. It may sound cheesy, but they seem to put out this Halloween-"ey" vibe. Its something different I guess. I love Papa's voice. The clean vocals are a nice departure from traditional doom.
p2601
aVI dont hate them at all. I've never seen them live but from what I heard and from what the other folks on this thread say they put out a really kickass show. And thats really important for a band. Also I find the whole retro occult rock revival really cool. And I enjoy that very much.\u000a\u000aAnd I couldn't agree more with /u/riggard "They're basically Blue Oyster Cult with a KISS image, and you know what? It's fun."\u000a\u000a
p2602
aVMy main issue with them is that we keep getting new mediocre ghost records instead of a new repugnant record. From what I understand, the second album is already written, but will likely never see the light of day because he's never going to dedicate time to repugnant as long as ghost records keep selling like they do. Also I find ghost pretty boring over all. Not terrible, but nothing worth getting too excited about

I'd expect Satan's Satyrs take a lot of Electric Wizard influence anyway.
p2723
aVNot *quite* what you're asking for, but when it comes to doom/punk type stuff, you may want to check out [Axegrinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZMwd_ODUY) and other, more crust punk (I know you said you're not looking for crust, but I think stuff like this is more doom/punk than hardcore) stuff like [Amebix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1KGWYId8vc)... especially if you want to hear the more filthy, punky side of doom.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, perhaps [Brainoil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyF1LketUr8)?
p2724
aVI'm familiar with all three, but thanks for the suggestions.\u000a\u000aLet me clarify: **I'm not after sludge**. I know my sludge quite well, but I'm not looking for heroin withdrawal gutter crust. \u000a\u000aWhat I'm after is anything along the lines of those two Electric Wizard songs and the [Satan's Satyrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePputnIXlVc) and [Alucarda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp8eDO45QDg) I mentioned. Fast, fuzzy, old-school rock 'n' roll with a doom low end. Retro, tape-hiss stuff. Unless there's not a lot of it about? I can think of a lot of garage rock/punk that sounds exactly like this, but I was wondering if there was more of it in the doom canon.\u000a\u000aI went searching on the Metallum and I came across [these girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Eq1ExaBCk). They're a bit more like what I mean. And I suppose there's always Midnight, but they're more influenced by 80s death and thrash.\u000a\u000a

aVYeah, I don't think I have anything then.  Perhaps Doom's Day, but they're more traditional doom, with some punk influence.  That's probably not what you're looking for.  Sorry!

If you go with the AMA subreddit you'll get a vast and varied audience as it is a default, as well as a quite large sub.\u000a\u000aIf it is done here, you'll just get the folks that have a more specified interested in the music and probably better questions/response yet the scale of the AMA would be smaller.

aVHey, I saw your dad in philly a few weeks ago.  Spirit Caravan is legendary!
p2745
aVI know! I love Jug Fulla Sun and the Elusive Truth!
p2746
aVHey, bruh. Of course your old man is legend. I got into his work in about '98 and have followed pretty much all his projects. My battle jacket has always had prominent The Obsessed and Saint Vitus patches. \u000a\u000aWelcome to reddit and have a good time here. 
p2747
aVThanks! He's awesome, and I idolize him.
p2748
aVYour dad's a cool mother fucker.  I loved him in the documentary "Such Hawks, Such Hounds."  Were you in that too?  I seem to remember a scene with his family.
p2749
aVCan you ask your Pops if Shrine Builder will ever tour again?
p2750
aVI saw him live with Spirit Caravan, great gig I plan to see him with Saint Vitus some time :)
p2751
aVSpirit Caravan is great. Would love to read an AMA.
p2752
aVQuickly met your dad in the crowd at psycho last year. He's a legend.
p2753
aVI met him after a St. Vitus gig and he's the realist dude ever. I've not heard everything Wino has put out, Shrine builder and his solo albums are glaring ommisions, but Spirit Caravan, The Obsessed, Saint Vitus, Hidden Hand are all solid gold. \u000a\u000aAs for your question is he famous on this sub, then I'd struggle to think of a man that this sub would genuinely love more than Wino other than Iommi.
p2754
aVShrinebuilder is really good.
p2755
aVBobby Libeling, Dave Chandler, Albert Witchfinder, Magnus Pilander, Mike Williams, Jus Oborn, Al Cisneros, Matt Pike, Lori S. I could go on ...

p2757
aVHe's very garrulous - good box office all round, if it were to happen.
p2758
aVAsk him to post the AMA on this sub, thanks for asking him btw, it'll definitely make a lot of fans on the doom metal subreddit happy. Anyways your dad's band Saint Vitus is one of the bands that really got me deeper into doom metal, and if it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't have found my way into this incredible genre of music. Tell him Reddit says thanks in advance! Not just for the AMA, but for the amazing things he's done for the genre.
p2759
aVDude, Wino is like the friggin' GOD of Doom metal! I think you'd be hard pressed to find a doomster who doesn't know him.  I'm sure we all love if it he came for a little while and did an AMA, like /u/Eluzim said.
p2760
aVI just texted him and he said he would probably do one, should he post it here, or on an AMA sub?
p2761
aVI'd say do it in the AMA subreddit. Its better equipped for that, and might get some exposure beyond just our humble group.
p2762
aVIn fact, it might give some exposure to our humble sub. 
p2763
aVKind of hard to say. I don't know that it would get much traction on the AMA sub, and probably most people on reddit who listen to doom and stoner are probably already subscribed here. Maybe do it in /r/metal?
p2764
aVWell, it seems he'd get the best attention either here or /r/metal, since, despite his renown here, he's very underground with regards to  the mainstream. 
p2765
aVThat's really awesome! Are you involved in his music besides occasionally listening to it? Id be jamming with him and recording every other day if I was you
p2766
aVIs your Dad all cool about letting you play his guitars and amps and stuff?
p2767
aVYeah, he gave me two of his guitars and an amp and I can play decently well.
p2768
aVThat's so badass! Looking forward to the AMA, please keep us posted dude! \u005cm/

aVProof?

aVI'm a Huge fan. Saw him with Spirit Caravan &amp; Shrinebuilder. \u000a\u000aI like his solo album from 2009. I'm also a big fan of A Hidden Hand, especially the 'Mother Teacher Destroyer' album. 
p2773
aVTo say your father is a significant figure in Doom is a bit like saying a Tyrannosaurus Rex was rather large and mildly carnivorous. Saw him and the rest of Vitus in 2013. Was very sad to hear what happened recently too, but I'm minded of what he said at that gig: "You're all Princes and Princesses, and don't let anyone make you think otherwise." That helped a great deal. So please send my thanks, for everything.
p2774
aVYes and yes. Pretty sure /u/this_time_i_mean_it is the one responsible for editing the subscribers line in honor of your pops. It's been like that for a couple of years now.

Might have something to do with Electric Wizard Mk.

Low end destruction with a really distinctive singer. III is a really good album.\u000a\u000aAnd as a bonus, do you know [Demonspeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yKTBRnY-yI)? Nothing doom about them, but they're a thrash band with swing influences. This means 90% of the time they sound more like Danzig than Exhorder, which is cool. Their singer was offered a place in Misfits, so the story goes.\u000a\u000aAnd listen to everyone else because they know what they're on about. \u000a\u000a

p2826
(lp2827
VWay better than black mass. Others don't exactly wow me, but after black mass, I'll take what I can get. \u000a\u000aI am Nothing and We Love the Dead are both awesome, classic-sounding Wizard songs. It's worth it just for those two. 
p2828
aVDefinitely better than Black Mass although there's good stuff on that album too. \u000aOthers don't wow you, what do you mean?\u000aThere hasn't been an Electric Wizard album made yet that isn't worth a listen. Some are more durable than others. \u000aI Am Nothing is definitely the standout track for me so far. \u000aI get a bit tired of this 'Old Wizard' thing though. Everyone seems to want them to sound exactly as they did circa Dopethrone/Come My Fanatics, but they simultaneously want something new, and then moan when they get it. \u000aI think this album proves they are fighting fit and still have a lot to offer. 
p2829
aVI deleted a part of my comment so I guess what I said makes less sense, sorry... I'm drunk.\u000a\u000aI meant that some songs don't wow me, but it's a much better overall album than black mass. I'm never expected another CMF/Dopethrone, but I really, really didn't like Black Mass. So this was a welcome change.\u000a\u000aThey're still fighting fit for sure, but ever since the guys that started Ramesses left they became a bit more...one dimensional. And considering what Ramesses put out on their own, you gotta admit that they lost some of their talent. Jus Osborn may be the bandleader, but he wasn't all of Electric Wizard. That all said, this album made me happy. I wasn't expecting dopethrone, I was just hoping it wouldn't suck. And it didn't. So I'm pretty happy.
p2830
aVI like it. It's heavy and repetitive. \u000a\u000aFor some context my favorite record by the Wiz is "Let Us Prey".
p2831
aVIt has dark satanical atmospheres and some groovy riffs. That's it is NOT a guitar centric album. Most of the songs are relient on the atmosphere and not the strength of the guitar parts. I am Nothing is perhaps the most memorable guitar riff. 
p2832
aVI was impressed by it.  It's not in the same league as their pre Black Masses stuff, but I only streamed it a couple of times (haven't bought it yet).  I'm definitely enjoying it though.  Sadiowitch was a bit of a Black masses rehash but it's still good and there are some real gems on it.  Not sure if I dig it as much as the Legalize Drugs EP yet but like I say I haven't listened to it too much.  So far I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10.
p2833
aVI'd definitely give it some more of you time... I've listened a fair bit since the release and its been a total pleasure... I'm so stoked Clayton Burgess has joined the band on bass... Satan's Satyrs are my favourite new band by far... I don't think he recored on the new record (I think Juss did the bass parts) but I'm sure he was influenced by Burgess' playing.\u000a\u000aI kind of regretted this post because I'm bored of people moaning about the album, and obviously this just invited people to do that some more... Electric Wizard are the rarest of things... they have created a rich and unique world of sounds and stuck to it for 20 years plus... It bums me out when all people can do is complain that they a re-using a couple of riffs... It just feels people don't take the time to really listen and pay respect...\u000a\u000aWhatever, i'm just unburdening myself to you... not sure why... \u000aGlad you like it 
p2834
aVOver-teased by Osborn (Dopethrone-like, hateful stuff), and I was a bit dissapointed in the end (SadioWitch, their most awful song). I kinda like this album, but it will not be on my AOTY list. \u000a\u000aEven thought I really dig the first track, I can't help but hear a Dopethrone riff. When I gave another ear to Black Masses, I really liked that playthrogh, because of the atmospheres, similar to Witchcult Today. \u000a\u000aFor a Electric Wizard maniac, it's a disappointment. Osborn gave us the "Back to the roots" speech and promises. So I except a lot from that album (maybe too much). But on the other hand, it's an honest enjoyable album, really heavy (the bass sound, raaaaa), with good moments. I love "I Am Nothing" and "Funeral Of Your Mind"\u000a\u000aOh, there's only ONE thing that pissed me off : THE ENDING. "Oh look it's the same sample at the beggining of Dopethrone, derp." I couldn't help but think about Osborn teasing everybody telling how much this album sounds like Dopethrone. It spoils everything !

VHaha wow the vocalist sounds eerily similar to Matt.
p2899
aVI feel like the vocals still sound really forced, just to get that kind of tone.  And the layered vocals in the first track were really sloppy, pulled me right out of the song.  Highlander has MUCH better vocals, they sound really natural.  Vocals should always sound really natural.\u000a\u000aObviously if you (or the singer) want to keep working with those kinds of guttural vocals you'll need to destroy your throat.  Tom Waits has suggested that he yelled/screamed into a pillow for about an hour a day.  That kind of yelling needs to be combined with a throat that actually rattles, then the right sound will come out and it'll take far less effort.  Singing like Matt Pike or Tom Waits means doing things wrong, it will involve ruining your singing voice and causing pain.  It will hurt.  Commit to it and you'll have badass vocals, otherwise you'll always sound like you're doing a character voice.\u000a\u000aUntil maybe years of doing it catches up and then you finally earn that gravel. \u000a\u000a\u000aI dig your style though, that thick and chunky sound.
p2900
aVThank you for your awesome feedback I really appreciate it. I must admit March and Die is the first time our bass player Duncan sang, Highlander is by our guitar player who has done a lot more songs. I fully agree with you about the vocal damage and training needed to keep up with this. \u000a\u000aAgain, thx for you advise!
p2901
aVThanks to you too. \u000a\u000aFor what it's worth, he seems to have a good sound developing.  His voice is steady and he seems to have enough air for it.  So if nothing else I'd say it's nearly there, but that extra commitment to throat destruction and I'm sure there's some solid noteworthy vocals in there.

p2945
aVI could be wrong, but I believe this artwork is a collaboration between Arik Roper and David D'Andrea.  David does tons of work for Om and has also contributed work for Sleep and Intronaut.  I've been fortunate enough to meet both Arik and David, and they are both really nice, humble, talented, awesome dudes with admirable work ethic.  They both make lots of screen printed posters and album artwork, so their work is very attainable
p2946
aVI knew little to nothing when I first got the artwork, as I justpulled it from Google images. Seeing Arik Roper's other work on his site was insanely cool, so now I think I ought to take the time to look up this other artist you mentioned.

aVI was at that show. Fucking mindblowing. The venue totally fit the in terms of ambiance. The large scultures to the sides of the stage could easily be a Sleep album cover. There was a fucking cloud of smoke before the show ever started. Unfortunately I only caught the last song of Kowloon. Hearing Dopesmoker live for the first time was a fucking experience. Literally sent shivers down my spine. I was halfway stoned from the cloud. I was sitting in the upper level looking down. They were so fucking loud the entire upper level was vibrating. I felt it in my seat. Hands down the best show I've ever been to. 10/10.\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/5GQAs3E.jpg\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/6fI5TuH.jpg\u000a\u000aI know the pictures suck, but I had to document this moment of my life.

There's this one [historical park I know](http://www.thunderbay.ca/Assets/media/Hi-Res/Fort+William+Historical+Park/ofw_aerial_hi.jpg) that I'd love to see a doom show in the middle of. Just imagining Electric Wizard bellowing riffs out from the center of that square of buildings makes me drool.\u000a\u000aYou're damn right about those statues too. I just keep imaging how some locations would lend such a great vibe to a doom show.

p2964
aVYeah, and I'm sure the shows are all better for it.\u000a\u000a I doubt I'd ever get to see any doom get played locally - with any big doom bands being near impossible -since I couldn't imagine the doom scene being substantial around where I live. Not to mention the fact that bands typically don't go out of their way to play where I live.

p3066
aVCheers pal. 
p3067
aVI love both 80s music and doom so I think this is an interesting idea. I wasn't hearing much of the doom influence until halfway through "Birthed By Wolves," where it came pretty suddenly and the transition was a little jarring. I think "Haunted" and "The Most Photographed Woman on the Planet" do a better job of balancing the doom and new wave aesthetics, and the vocal performance is better on those tracks as well. Although you tried to mix things up with synth progressions, "Haunted" gets a little repetitive, and I think if you're going to mix these genres it might be a better idea to borrow more from the song structures of new wave rather than the glacial pace of doom. Overall though I enjoyed the songs, and while I never would have thought I'd hear a mixture of doom and new wave, it does make sense given the aesthetics and instrumentation of the genres. Keep up the interesting work.
p3068
aVYeah, "BBW" has a big doom breakdown. I agree "Haunted" gets repetitive. I also agree I was pretty lazy doing the vox for "BBW". They're not as inspired as on the other tracks. Glad you enjoyed it :)

Maybe we should make a post about it to get ideas from everyone.\u000a\u000aStuff to check out: [here's a link to the bandcamp](http://destroyeroflight.bandcamp.com/album/bizarre-tales-vol-2), and why the hell not, here's a link to the music video for Greet Death (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3kmuNKeoWo), since 3Goats Moving Pictures did such an awesome job on it I can't resist linking to it.
p3106
aVI'd be down for the meetup. Agreed with it on the 2nd day.
p3107
aVI'll second the vote for Wo Fat. Love them. \u000a\u000aIt took me a while to warm up to The Conjuring (2014), their latest album, but I absolutely love it now.\u000a\u000aTheir previous album, The Black Code (2012) is a bit faster in it's pace. \u000a\u000aI'd recommend trying both out. Last time I looked both albums are on youtube in their entirety. Of course you should buy em if you love em!

p3179
aVAwesome list, also thanks for taking the time to link them all. 
p3180
aVYou're welcome! I think I had more fun making it than most people do listening to it; I enjoy posts like these because they make me go back though my music collection and dig out old favorites I may not have listened to in a while. Honestly, I left a lot of other stuff out, just because it didn't fit anywhere between Electric Wizard and Candlemass.
p3181
aVAwesome list...I have to rebuild my digital collection, so if you feel like making more lists, send 'em my way!
p3182
aVHmm, if you're really that convicted about it, I could put everything with a 'doom' or 'Stoner' tag on it into a Bitsync folder and send you the sync key....

aVYou 100%. Absolutely. Positively. Need to listen to the band Hell. You are so mother fucking welcome. 
p3189
aVIf you like Blood Ceremony, check out other female-fronted occult rock bands like Jex Thoth, Mount Salem, and Electric Citizen. Avatarium is another female-fronted doom band with Leif Edling of Candlemass. Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats are a great Sabbathy doom band that even opened for Sabbath last year. Since you like Candlemass, also check out Solitude Aeturnus, they're like the American C-mass. Ghost isn't everyone's cup of tea but check out their first album. Check out Subrosa, its like Electric Wizard and Sleep, but with a female singer and violins. Witchfinder General is a good old school traditional doom band as well.\u000a\u000aP.S. A lot of the bands you listed are my favorites.

p3199
aVThat's funny. The song is called Encrusted. The band was called Hounds, not that we did anything but mess around in a garage.

aVI wish Windhand would go back to this 'riff' style and leave behind the 'wall of sound' style of Soma. The songs just seem to blend into monotony instead of having their own distinct voice. \u000a\u000aIdunno. Maybe I'm just crazy.
p3245
aVI like Soma but I do find the riffs more stand out and memorable on this record.

aVI like soundscapes and I like riffing. Its all good to me. :-D Everyone has their own preference though
p3247
aVI have to agree, I find Soma is very boring to listen to, whereas that first album was much more interesting. Honestly think Soma is one of the most overrated doom albums to come out recently\u2026.

aVMan, I must not have the discerning ear of others. They both sound like basically the same band to me.

VI got a sXe tattoo that I designed on my arm when I was 18 years old. I was straightedge until I was 30, and then, I only drank a small amount while I was in Italy visiting family.\u000a\u000aA few years later, I decided I wasn't straightedge at all. I now plan to get dates (1979-2012) and RIP tattooed beneath it all.
p3333

p3342
aVI did enjoy that. Very much.
p3343
aVbut can i be both?
p3344
aVNo
p3345
aVBrutal. Go to another tattooer. 
p3346
aVNope, it's perfect just like this. 
p3347
aVI get that, but that same effect can be achieved by a professional and it will be legible for years to come. Look how bad your straight edge tattoo blew out, I could barely tell what it said. The same will happen to your deep, jagged, wonky wizard tattoo. 
p3348
aVI'd venture to say they're not terribly concerned about that...
p3349
aVYeah, I get that. I guess my point is, that same effect can be achieved by a professional. It will look better, won't scar, and won't blow out. Also, whatever scratcher did this probably knows fuck all about bloodborne pathogens and cross contamination. "Dude, check out my sweet new MRSA infection!"
p3350
aVi would bet the tattoos arent done by the same artist - the new tattoo is still fresh and the skin is probably inflamed a bit. i bet it will heal much nicer than the straightedge one. 
p3351
aVGood chance. I tattoo for a living. It will heal like shit.
p3352
aV&gt;I tattoo for a living. \u000a\u000aGreat, then you understand that there's a tattoo culture outside of professional tattooing and that they don't really overlap.

asVwhy I love Ufomammut
p3355
(lp3356
V&gt;~~a moment in most Ufomammut songs~~\u000a\u000aon most Ufomammut albums*\u000a\u000aCall me old fashioned, but bands like Ufomammut should really be listened to as it was intended, in my opinion: From first to last track on the album. Nothing is left to coincidence on their releases. Artwork, lyrics, music, order of songs is all carefully put together to provide a full experience. Picking the songs out of order (or in this case, linking to somewhere in the middle of a song) borders blasphemy in my book. \u000a\u000aBut that's just me. They are one of my absolute favourite bands as well. 
p3357
aVI feel the same way, actually. I am 100% an "entire album" person. I just noticed this phenomenon happening in multiple songs within an album.
p3358
aVYou know, reading it now, my original comment probably came across a bit dickish, which was not at all intended. That's what you get for commenting before you had your fix of caffeine, ha. \u000a\u000aI follow you, actually. But in the case of Ufomammut and others, I can't diverge from my policies. Carry on!
p3359
aVit's all good brother
p3360
aVYou forgot [10].
p3361
aVI saw them at hellfest in 2012, I remember standing in the pit waiting for them to start, being a bit bummed that I didn't have any weed to smoke when the guy next to me starts rolling up a giant blunt, and then started hunting around for something to pack it down with before he sparked up. I wear glasses and often use the arms for just this purpose so I tapped him on the shoulder, handed him my glasses and mimed that he should use them his face lit up in a huge smile, he gratefully accepted, sparked up the blunt, had 3 tokes and passed it to me and utterly refused to take it back. Needless to say the Ufomammut set was absolutely transcendental haha.
p3362
aV&gt;  I wear glasses and often use the arms for just this purpose\u000a\u000aYou and everyone else who wears glasses and smokes.
p3363
aVUfomammut are the heaviest thing I'v ever heard, I love them.\u000a\u000aThe tracks just get heavier throughout- you think "surely it can get no more awesome than this!" AND THEN IT DOES.\u000a
p3364
aVThat's why I love High on Fire. Every note is that moment.
p3365
aVEvery note is more intense the than the last 
p3366
aVLooking forward to them at Maryland Deathfest 2015 big time.
p3367
aVMy favourite song for this is the hook in Stardog off Idolum. I think it's around 4 minutes something when the pulsing guitars kick in. The riff is just one fucking note but gawdam it gives me shivers
p3368
aVWeird. I just heard Ufomammut the other day browsing "Heaviest albums". The otherworldly atmospheric sounds were extremely euphoric for me. I had the strangest blood rushing sensations throughout my body. There is nothing like it. I am not speaking to the musical talent necessarily, but rather the very bold arrangment.
p3369
aVWhat is heaviest albums? I would like to view it.\u000a\u000aUfomammut is fucking amazing. Check out Sons of Otis for a similar feel, though of course nothing could approach ufom.
p3370
aVI can't get into them, sorry. Too much boring, too many generic riffs, not enough payoff.
p3371
aVI got that feeling from all the albums except Godlike Snake, Snail King and Eve...mainly Eve.

aVEveryone seems to be enjoying your work. A torrent would allow people to enjoy the whole thing (not cut into parts) without visiting YouTube.

p3391
aVNice work!
p3392
aVI haven't watched the video yet but is intentional for it to sync up?
p3393
aVI edited the video so it syncs up a little better than it would if you just played them next to each other, little things like gunshots, battle toads, explosions, screams, walking, stuff like that.  Even if I didn't make the edits, the music captures the mood really well. \u000a\u000aI don't know Sleep's original intention, but it would be a weird coincidence that these just happen to go well together.  I heard Sleep has talked about the movie's influence on the album before, but idk.
p3394
aVGood work. I'll admit, I've never been able to power through much of Holy Mountain before. Maybe this will be the difference maker.

sVWhat are the best headphones for blasting doom metal at mind-fucking, tinnitus-inducing volume?
p3555
(lp3556
VNone. If you're listening with headphones you should do it at a safe volume. Don't damage your hearing and you'll enjoy music for years to come. And honestly, a good set of headphones can provide you with all the frequencies you want to hear at low volumes. When driven too loud the headphones won't produce everything clearly.\u000a\u000aSource: I have hearing loss from playing &amp; listening to music. Sorry to sound like a parent but your hearing is worth protecting and if you lose it you don't get it back.
p3557
aVI'm half deaf in one ear and I blame ear buds. Please don't do it (seriously)....\u000a\u000aMusic sounds like shit when you're half deaf.
p3558
aVThere are a few great headphones for doom metal in the price range. \u000a\u000aGrado makes some of the best headphones for rock/metal for the fast and tight bass response the [Grado SR80e ](http://www.amazon.com/Grado-Prestige-Series-SR80e-Headphones/dp/B00L1LXOWS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420685473&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=grado) would be a good choice for a more well rounded sound. However they can be bright and sound a bit cold however they are very fun headphones. Since they are open they also provide no sound isolation.\u000a\u000aSuperlux HD-681 EVO are another great pair in the price range. They come in two colors [black](http://www.amazon.com/Superlux-HD681EVO-B-HD-681-Black/dp/B00CAG1ZAQ/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420686139&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords=superlux+hd668b+evo) and [white](http://www.amazon.com/Superlux-HD-681-Professional-Monitoring-Headphones/dp/B00CAG1ZG0/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420686139&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=superlux+hd668b+evo) they have a nice warm sound with good bass and decent mids these are also fun for doom. They come with a nice set of accessories 2 detachable cables 2 sets of ear pads velour and leatherette and a bag. \u000a\u000aI own a pair of grados and wear the evos for about 8hrs a day at work. So I have experience with both sets. Depending on your choice in doom and other music would be the other types of music you listen to honestly. \u000a
p3559
aVWhat's your top budget?
p3560
aV$50 as of now but don't be afraid to post more expensive options as this is something I'd be willing to save money for, but god forbid please no more than $110
p3561
aVI have the dj style headphones from monoprice that kick ass, pretty cheap too. But don't destroy your ears dude, I'm only 18 and I have to make everyone repeat themselves because I played my headphones too loud too much and I never wore protection at concerts
p3562
aVI'm using RHA MA750s, they're amazing. If you dislike in-ears, check out the Audio Technica ATH-M50x.\u000a\u000aIf you're on that budget, get Soundmagic E-10s. Best bang for buck in that pricerange.\u000a\u000aEdit: If you just want shitty bass cannons without any mids or treble just get cheap-ass Skullcandies or something
p3563
aVDon't get anything that has a bass or treble booster. Recently just got a Stereo headphones by Sony, which is flat and I think it's worth it because it's fairly cheap. \u000a\u000aAlso, blasting away at high volume is not safe at all. You will never enjoy the music when everything is pushed up. 
p3564
aVThere's nothing less metal than not being able to enjoy metal.
p3565
aVif you want to crank it up loud and not have any distortion you gotta look at the quality of the audio file.  fyi. 
p3566
aVIam thinking of getting the\u000a\u000a"Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro 80 Ohm" \u000a\u000aHeard good things about them, go check out a review.
p3567
aVI use the Laredo headphones from the California Headphone Co for my day-to-day experiences. One of the best soundscapes I've heard in a $20 headphone. \u000a\u000aAlso note this is $20 shipped from Amazon!
p3568
aVI have [these Sony earbuds](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDREX10LP-BLK-In-Ear-Headphones/dp/B004XXQI1U/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420739978&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sony+earbuds), and I discovered a trick that may help.  They come with several sizes of rubbery ear buds, and I've noticed that the largest size really amplifies the sound, esp. the low end.  It also amplifies anything that touches the headphone cord (like my jacket zipper as it rubs against it while I'm walking) so I only use the oversize ones at home when I'm sitting still.\u000a\u000aAlso, what everyone else said, hearing loss is no joke, all those shows of my youth without earplugs are catching up to me.

aVI'm at CES and just got to try Alpines headphones. They have tactile drivers that actually shake the headphones for bass(as well as killer bass also). Currently only available at the Apple Store for $299.

aVA small, middle of nowhere town with a population less than 200. It's so unbelievably dead, **even the bar shut down**...\u000a\u000aHowever, my newer car has an XM Satellite radio receiver in it and I get the channel called Liquid Metal. They play pretty much every type of metal you could imagine. They have some awesome interviews from people in various metal genre's, and occasionally they even let the artists take over and play the stuff that they were influenced by. Sometimes they play more mainstream stuff (Slipknot, Upon a Burning Body, etc.), and sometimes they play some surprisingly underground stuff (Portal, Destroyer 666, etc.). There's no censorship either which is a definite plus. Here's the website if you want to learn more.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.siriusxm.com/liquidmetal

I can (and have) listen to Sorrow and Extinction multiple times in a day and enjoy it just as much the first time I heard the album. I'm certainly not saying that Foundations of Burden isn't a good album, either. I think it's an amazing album, I just wish that it sounded more like Sorrow and Extinction did.

Blue Cheer are, in general, definitely worth you time...\u000aI wouldn't quite put Holden up there with Tony Iommi, just by dint of the sheer length and breadth of Iommi's career of riffs...

Kind of buzzed, kind of really fucking tired, kind of hung over. Going from Vegas to Philly and it's about 3:30AM EST so my sense of time is all fucked up and we're about half way through the flight when we hit the most ridiculous turbulence I have ever encountered in my entire life; it felt like the plane would drop 30 feet then jar to the right. Shit is falling out of the cabinets, people are getting sick, it was intense. This entire time I'm jamming out in the very last seat of the plane to Earthless - From the Ages and it was just a really odd, kind of awesome experience. Just really trippy.\u000a\u000aTL;DR - Was in a death plane, thought I was going to die, but was okay cuz jamming to Earthless.

aVEh, it's all personal taste. I like other genres of metal as well, so the vocals don't bother me. I like the mix on them especially, screaming, but put really far back so music is at the forefront. Check out their Pink Floyd, I just posted it to Stonerrock.

I'm too lazy to link, besides y'all should be familiar with most of my picks. I'm going to limit to one album per band to keep it from all being Black Sabbath.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a~~10. Cult of Luna - Somewhere Along the Highway~~\u000a\u000a~~It's not straight-up doom, but post/sludge is doom as far as I care.~~ \u000a\u000a~~9~~10. Electric Wizard - Dopethrone\u000a\u000a~~8~~9. Slow - Unsleep\u000a\u000a~~7~~8. Witchfinder General - Witchfinder General\u000a\u000a~~6~~7. Pallbearer - Sorrow and Extinction\u000a\u000a~~5~~6. Warning - Watching From a Distance\u000a\u000aEdit:: 5. Thou - Heathen\u000a\u000aHow'd I forget this? I went into the list specifically thinking about this album.\u000a\u000a4\u005c. Uncle Acid &amp; the deadbeats - Mind Control\u000a\u000a3\u005c. Type O Negative - World Coming Down\u000a\u000aApparently not everyone agrees on them being doom. I consider them doom, so fuck off.\u000a\u000a2\u005c. Candlemass - Nightfall\u000a\u000a1\u005c. Black Sabbath - Master of Reality\u000a\u000aShout-Outs (not familiar enough):\u000a\u000aSleep\u000a\u000aSolitude Aeturnus\u000a\u000aPentagram\u000a\u000aSaint Vitus\u000a\u000aTrouble\u000a\u000aCathedral\u000a\u000aWhile Heaven Wept\u000a\u000aMore Shout-Outs (close contenders):\u000a\u000aPagan Altar\u000a\u000aFuneral\u000a\u000aEnd of Green\u000a\u000aTeardown (not technically doom, but close enough for me)\u000a\u000aJack Frost\u000a\u000aBolt Thrower (only the IVth Crusade, though)\u000a\u000a\u000aSo there you have it.

aVHey OP, glad to see you're enjoying our homegrown Richmond sludge, but you don't need to listen to Windhand's music on youtube, the whole thing is [on their Bandcamp](https://windhandva.bandcamp.com/)\u000a\u000aMy top doom albums:\u000a\u000a5. Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath\u000a4. You Ruin Everything by Pigs (more sludge than doom but idc)\u000a3. Soma by Windhand\u000a2. Miserable by Bongripper\u000a1. Dopethrone by Electric Wizard
p4028
aVYeah, I bought Soma on vinyl. I love the album, and I've heard it a hundred times. A YouTube link is a little more convenient for everyone than a bandcamp stream, though.
p4029
aVK, just wanted to make sure you knew lol. Are you from Richmond, or around here, or did you see them on their tour?
p4030
aVNone of the above. Up in Ohio, and couldn't clear the calendar for either of the dates. Just really digging the band; got my patch and everything. Have you seen about Dorothea's solo album?
p4031
aVI have, but have not listened to it. Is it doom, or?
p4032
aVI'd say it's doomy in feeling, not as much instrumentation. It reminds me of what would happen if Mark Lanegan wrote more good songs. Christ, imagine a duet between her and Lanegan...
p4033
aV1. Electric Wizard - Come My Fanatics...\u000a\u000a2. Black Sabbath - Master of Reality\u000a\u000a3. Sleep - Dopesmoker\u000a\u000a4. Melvins - Bullhead\u000a\u000a5. Saint Vitus - Born To Late\u000a\u000a6. Uncle Acid - Bloodlust\u000a\u000a7. Witchfinder General - Death Penalty\u000a\u000a8. Stoned Jesus - First Communion\u000a\u000a9. Reverend Bizarre - In The Rectory\u000a\u000a10. Conan - Horseback Battle Hammer
p4034
asVWriting lyrics [discussion]
p4035
(lp4036
VI don't write lyrics but as a listener let me just say that if you're running out of steam don't push it, it's better to steer the theme to some more abstract or fictional concepts (like Sleep singing about weed caravans dragging across the desert) than to just hammer in subjects that are spent. \u000a\u000aLet your imagination run wild, it fits the music and should solve your problem.
p4037
aVAngsty usually means "overdramatic" or coming across as silly and immature. I suppose you could call some of the Wizard's stuff "angsty", but "We Hate You" isn't about drama. They just fuckin' hate you. I think the kicker here is to not take any of it too seriously.
p4038
aVWhat I do sometimes is write sort of a story and give it shape as lyrics. Usually I'll get one line or so in my head and then rush to write it down and get as much as I can out of one writing session and usually I can come back to it where I left off. Or I think of very basic themes like the elements to start from and make it more specific and personal\u000a\u000aAlso when I want to write but don't have any ideas I put on music that has a similar feel for what I want to write, but I don't listen for the lyrics I just listen for a certain atmosphere to put my head in. I then stop the music when I start writing and only listen to it before lest it distracts me or I write something too similar.
p4039
aVI have a pretty similar approach
p4040
aVI think to avoid having your writings sound the same, come up with several ideas or themes and once you use one, try to throw it in the back and go through the others so when you use it again its been awhile and you won't be thinking about what you already wrote using it. Or look at the theme from all its angles and attributes to see exactly where the lyrics can come from. That was hard to put that into words, but do you get what I mean?
p4041
aVOccult/Satanic lyrics are often in doom metal such as Candlemass and Ghost.

aVWrite about monsters.

aVAgreed, they played two nights in Chicago a couple years ago. First night was sold out and me and my friends were outside and Dylan came out there.

Him and the rest of the band tried to get us on the guest list, but the venue wouldn't allow it.\u000a\u000aWe went to the show the next night and Dylan approached us and apologized that he couldn't get us in the previous night.

(lp4117
VI value you guys' opinion so I was wondering what you thought of the new Buried Sleeper track we've been playing for a while now. This is one of the better recordings of it so I thought I'd share. I don't know what's going on with the weird pitch-shifting effects on the vocals; I only asked for reverb and delay! Would love to hear your thoughts. We're so excited to get it recorded for our new album, we've got some guitar overdubs to do, then bass and vocals. Can't wait to finish it all!!
p4118
aVPretty fucking sick, man. When that heavy riffing comes in at 3:40 and 7:00, goddamn. Your drummer has a pretty sweet deal, his playing complements the riffs really well whereas some stoner-doom bands just have these overwhelming, swelling drums at entirely unnecessary times.\u000a\u000aYeah, I like it a lot.\u000a\u000aAlso, got a time line on when the album may be finished? I'd definitely cop a copy if I have the cash then.

VNot trying to be a wise-ass, but why is this "blackened"? Is it something about the lyrics or the image, because I sure as hell am not hearing it in the music? And don't get me wrong, this stuff is great, proggy and original. I just don't get the need to label this under such an arbitrary genre.\u000a
p4138
aVTheir previous album had very black metal-style vocals, a la Thou.  So they kinda fell under the Blackened doom moniker from that.  His voice is rather different on this one though so it's definitely worthy of a separate label.  
p4139
aVSome of the guitar tones and especially the raspiness of the vocalist's delivery (which is rather unique) suggest the comparison to the "black" palette. But this is very much a boundary-crossing band and song.

p4183
aVI've never really got the whole jacket and patch thing, what's the history behind it? I presume it's a legacy from punk.
p4184
aVI'm fairly sure (95%+) that it originates with bikers. Bikers often wear cut-offs with a big club badge on the back and often smaller badges representing club positions, various rallies and events, friendly clubs and so on on the front. This goes way back before punk, to the 60's at least, maybe even the late 50's?

Seriously.\u000a\u000a[Windhand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7Nf7_Z9dPU&amp;list=PLfW2AYRb0ykzGdOouPnCONlQr7Fc0SR7C), fantastically heavy, female fronted doom.\u000a\u000a[Bell Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KebMq2AIVM&amp;list=PLYscXtOSkiBnFMFljSaa-fa42h1xafVvj), bleak, desolate, soul crushing, slow and heavy.\u000a\u000a[Monolord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCc901E02eY), great new doom. Very heavy with distant, watery vocals. Empress Rising is an excellent record.\u000a\u000a[Slomatics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iem9uIBaOCg), awesome doom from Belfast. Estron is the "Warp Riders" of doom, imho.\u000a\u000aEdit: Forgot about [Coltsblood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XogeWSGxgGw). Similar in heaviness to Conan. Their first full length that came out last year created a rift in space.

p4234

aVI'm a huge EW fan so you'll probably like what I like.\u000a\u000aBongripper - Amazing instrumental doom band. Get Satan Worshipping Doom, probably my favourite album ever.\u000a\u000aBongzilla - Thick stoner doom riffs.\u000a\u000aChurch of Misery - Japanese doom, obsessed with serial killers\u000a\u000aConan - The heaviest band in the world. Get everything, including the split with Bongripper.\u000a\u000aDopethrone - The band, not the album\u000a\u000aGoya - Electriz Wizard worship\u000a\u000aGrey Widow - Heavy, blackened sludge. Very good.\u000a\u000aHolly Hunt - Big booming riffs\u000a\u000aMonolord - Swedish fuzz doom\u000a\u000aSea Bastard - Sludge/Black Metal/Doom\u000a\u000aSleep - The original stoner band. Get Dopesmoker\u000a\u000aSlomatics - Inspired Conan, similar vein. Get the new album Estron.\u000a\u000aWindhand - Stoner doom
p4242
aVAlso check out Whores. One of my favourites right now but don't quite fit into normal "doom" tags.
p4243
aVGlad to see Whores. getting more attention. So noisy! They're on tour right now with Retox, too, FYI.
p4244
aVDon't grab Sleeps dopesmoker as the first thing you hear! Start with Asbestosdeath (unclean/dejection), then do Sleep Volume One. Will make so much more sense when you listen to Holy Mountain, then do Dopesmoker.

aVSpinning Moss now, if you like Electric Wizard OP then you'll dig Moss. Teeth of Lions is cool too, keep meaning to dig my cd out of the box in the attic every time I see them mentioned on here and never do ... this weekend might be the time tho. \u000a\u000aI'd also recommend Bong for repetitious and meditive doom. You could also check out Of Spire and Throne for a slightly death take on doom metal. Both are heavy as. 
p4247
aVUncle Acid and the Deadbeats, Church Of Misery, Reverend Bizarre, Sleep, Satan's Satyrs, Weedeater, Monolord, Orange Goblin, Samsara Blues Experiment, Stonehelm, and Windhand.\u000a\u000aIf you want to get into Sunn O))), you might want to try their new album with Scott Walker.  My favorite album by them is Black One, though.
p4248
aVHere's some lesser known bands I like: \u000a\u000aSlabdragger, Dopethrone, Caronte, Fister, and Horseskull
p4249

p4250
aV[Cathedral's best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bTHPvTRcnw), in my opinion.
p4251
aVSwallow the Sun - The Morning Never Came and Ghosts of Loss are two of my favourite doom albums of all time.\u000a\u000aYou can also delve deep into the discography of My Dying Bride. I absolutely love them and they've been my favourite band for 6-7 years now. \u000a\u000aEsoteric is also a good band, their music makes me physically ill and exhausted, I don't know why, but they just have that effect on me (not a bad thing). \u000a\u000a
p4252
aVMy personal favourite is [Katatonia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZQ4ys9Xojw). Death-doom, mostly, for their earlier albums (pre-1996)

p4277
aVNot completely doom, but I can recommend the Dead Skeletons with their [Dead Mantra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsyrOGRxF0E). Not super doomy but very mantra-y. Maybe that can bring you further on your journey :)\u000a
p4278
aVThat's a cool track, I dig it. Kinda reminds me a little of [Wooden Shjips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jv9IoXUp-U) and the [Cosmic Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdPeEUB0p-w). I think OP might have to start looking in to some Psych rock to get close to what he's looking for.

VSay what you will about Woods, but David Gold was ridiculously good looking, there ain't no denyin.
p4320
aVNot a fan on this or his later work, but I used to talk to Dave while he was recording Pursuit of the Sun in 2004. He sent me an early mix near the end of summer, when I was 16, and just starting to date the girl I'm still with today. I spent a lot of late nights walking along the river here in town, 4 am, listening to this CD on my old walkman. I didn't even have an mp3 player yet. It really brings me back to that summer.\u000a\u000aWould I like the album if I heard it for the first time today? Nope. But talking to him, and hearing mixes, really helped me grow as an artist. He was always a nice guy, too. \u000a\u000aGive "Pursuit of the Sun" a shot. Still some cringey lyrics but nothing so bad.
p4321
aVAm I the only one who doesn't like Woods of Ypres? 
p4322
aVUh.... You're not the only one.  Some potential but it needs better songwriting structure. 
p4323
aVI never cared for their later stuff.\u000a\u000aDave's lyrics were cringeworthy and WAY too literal for my tastes.

aVI've seen this band come up on forums and what not, but never bothered to give them a listen.

Turns out the singer died in an automobile accident almost 3 years ago and was only 31 years old.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say I listened to the rest of the song.

aVI had a ticket this year but had passport issues and didn't go. Bongripper is awesome on the list and almost worth it alone as is Eyehategod, but honestly it seems lacking right now compared to past years. I'm sure they are trying to negotiate more bands. The last two curators were Opeth and Electric fuckin Wizard. Hard to follow.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, Maryland Deathfest 2015 has a much more interesting lineup to me. 
p4413

aVTerrestrials is a massive tease. Builds up for a half an hour and leads nowhere. It makes a great intro to GrimmRobe Demos, though. \u000a\u000aI do wish Soused had a larger focus on *THE DRONES O)))* but I didn't expect it to based on the record label and the second-billing and all that. 
p4437
aVOn one hand, I really kind of like the more experimental musical style Sunn's going with for this album. But at the same time, I really dislike it because Scott Walker's voice is way too jarring for the atmosphere-- which is probably the point of this, I guess. Just doesn't really feel right to me.

aVForgive my ignorance, but if sleep were to rerecord holy mountain, and release that, would that be allowed? with that scenario, sadly, there'll be no haikus :(
p4513
aV&gt; Forgive my ignorance, but if sleep were to rerecord holy mountain, and release that, would that be allowed? \u000a\u000aDepends on the original deal. And even if they can, Al is in two other bands and Matt and Jason are each in another band. So it seems unlikely that they\u2019d spend the time to re-record an old album.
p4514
aVForgive my ignorance, but in what other band is Al beside OM?
p4515
aVI thought he was in Shrinebuilder, but I double-checked and Wino says that \u201c\u2026Cisneros is insane so Shrinebuilder is not going to happen\u2026\u201d. So I guess he\u2019s only in one other band.

aVI noticed in the Decibel top 100 doom metal albums issue that just came out that there is an Earache ad that mentions a reissue of Holy Mountain coming soon so I'd guess that means vinyl. Good that people will have access to it again, but a real shame that Sleep won't profit from it since they certainly deserve to. I heard that Justin Boaderick was unaware of their recent reissue of the s/t Godflesh LP until after it came out and also made no money off of it at all. Earache seems like they are into getting bands into bad contracts and exploiting them.

aV'I recall in 1992 Earache made the first Black Sabbath tribute album which we sent personally to Tony Iommi.We heard back that he loved it, especially Sleep who according to him, "embodied the spirit of early Sabbath". This got quoted a lot by us as a hype thang- and within a short while things got outta hand, Sleep began to entertain managers/lawyers/ etc to extricate themselves from our record deal.Bands quitting an indie that discoverd and/or supported them to go join with major label is quite commonplace it seems.'    \u000aSource: http://askearache.blogspot.co.uk/2006/06/sleep-with-earache-what-happened.html?m=1

p4530
aVKind of sad that there are people that would do this in blink of an eye, not to mention that these guys are legendary and VERY well known around the metal world and the music world in a whole.
p4531
aVVery few bands can simply choose to reissue their old albums. If you sign them over to a label, then they're signed over. That's the price you pay to get them to do the release for you. As they say, be careful what you sign. You might be one of the 1 in 1000 bands that has a resurgence of popularity 20 years from now. (But most aren't, which is why record labels take a risk whenever they commission an album.)

VAnd so Doommetal was born. 
p4641
aVSomething I posted in the /r/metal thread on the same subject:\u000a\u000a&gt;This album changed my life. I was 12, not really into music in any real capacity except what I heard on the radio, some stuff my mum had on cassette. I was checking out some other cassettes and there was this old orange-coloured one with my dad's writing on it. Side A said "Python Live" and Side B said "Black Sabbath". I thought, "Cool, Monty Python!" and listened to it. When I got to the end of the tape I tried rewinding it to the beginning but the machine didn't like this particular tape. I sighed and put on the other side, pressed play and prepared to wait 45 minutes until the tape finished.\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;I heard the sound of rain, thunder, and a tolling bell. I was confused. Suddenly the first chord kicked in. I was a little unnerved. Then the singing started. WTF was this??\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;I'll admit to not liking it straight away but I was certainly intrigued. I listened to it several times until one day as I walked through the park listening to it on my Walkman, grey clouds rolling across the sky and rain pouring down, the first song gave me chills. *I got it now.*\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;Since that day I have become besotted with Black Sabbath and in particular Tony Iommi, to the point where I am in a doom/stoner band and have forced my bandmates into covering some of their songs. If I hadn't stumbled upon that old orange-coloured cassette, I wouldn't be who I am today.

asV[meta] What advice would you give to an aspiring doom band?
p4807
(lp4808
VAs someone who picked up a guitar specifically to join a buddy's stoner/doom band two and half months ago, take everything I say with a massive grain of salt.\u000a\u000aI think the most important lesson we've learned so far is that a lot of times keeping things as simple as possible is better. Don't get too crazy with your songwriting; this seems like something that's a lot harder for people who are longtime and highly skilled musicians. They feel like they have to put so much into every riff when a lot of the "heavy" comes from letting the riff come out naturally. Don't get me wrong, get good at your instruments, but remember you're playing doom and not some technical shit.\u000a\u000aSecondly, while equipment isn't going to make the band alone, it sure as fuck makes a difference. I just picked up a Boss FZ-2 Hyperfuzz pedal and holy fuck did it make a difference. You don't always need the biggest most expensive shit but sometimes it makes sense when you see all the greats using similar equipment, you know?\u000a\u000aThird, JAM. Jam, jam, jam. Come up with a cool riff or whatever, then play it with your band but keep fucking around with it.\u000a\u000aLastly, originality, while nice, isn't always the main goal. Play what you want to hear, experiment with different sounds from different inspirations. Don't be a pure cover band but don't be afraid to be comparable. As time goes on your personal sound will develop but take lessons from the masters rather than diving head first.\u000a\u000aAgain, don't take this too seriously. I probably don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I don't really know stylistically what you're trying to play and a lot of it depends on that. I also don't know your musical experience so I'm formulating my response off of my own (lack of) experience.
p4809
aVDisclaimer: I am not in a metal band. \u000a\u000aI have been playing a lot of other music over the years. I would recommend you find bands that you really enjoy. Play their songs. Try to copy their sound. Figure what it is that they do that you like. This may lead to a pedal set up you haven't thought of, or techniques you haven tried yet. Then branch out onto your own sound. \u000a\u000aI'm not saying you should just be Sleep or Windhand (sub in your favorite band) copy cat. But you will probably learn a lot by trying to play their songs. 
p4810
aVThis is a double edged sword. This is a good place to start and acquire your desired sound/direction..but after that, learn some other things from different bands or even other genres of music that you can take back and incorporate into your sound...it will help with originality and not becoming a cover/tribute band

asVLooking for a new amplifier. Suggestions.
p4899
(lp4900
VThe guitarist in my band plays a Verellen Loucks. Hand built amp that is basically made for doom. To me it sounds just like a sunn model T but is much MUCH louder. Absolutely the loudest amp I've ever heard. if you run a full stack with it, you can crush rooms. 
p4901
aV[deleted]
p4902
aVIf you're strapped for cash there are pedals out there that can mimic the Model T sound for just a few hundred, as opposed to the $1200-$1500 you'd pay for a new Model T clone.
p4903
aVInteresting... 
p4904
aVYeah, there's some guy that sells a pedal on Etsy for around $200 that mimics the sound of the Model T. Sounds pretty close.
p4905
aVAlso, if you're on a budget, definitely just get a beta lead or two. They're loud as fuck and have a great tone. They used to go for around 350, they might be up to 500 now, but if you hunt craigslist, you can find a good deal. Really killer for the price. 
p4906
aVI use a Traynor YBA-3 with an acoustic 4x12. It's 120 watts so it's got plenty of headroom, but you can get it to break up nicely if you want. Very similar to an ampeg v4. For distortion I use a rat and a boss hm-2 that's a little screwed up and sounds more like a fuzz now. Guitar is a les paul and sometimes a parts strat I made. 
p4907
aVYou should check out [Hovercraft Amps](http://www.hovercraftamps.com/). They do a bunch of Sunn-style stuff for pretty reasonable prices.\u000a\u000aOtherwise, look into some of [Correct Sound's](https://reverb.com/shop/olegs-shop) stuff. The make a bunch of Sunn flavored pedals, including a [Model T preamp in a box](https://reverb.com/item/71199-correct-sound-custom-mt-tube-preamp-2014).\u000a\u000aMy setup is a Gibson RD reissue, black Russian Muff, Daredevil Gold Leader, and OCD for dirt (soon to be adding a FuzzHugger Doom Bloom), into an Ampeg V2.
p4908
asVWhen did the Doom scene become a thing?
p4909
(lp4910
VThe term "Doom" goes back at least as far as the first Trouble record (Psalm 9/"Trouble") in 1984 and may go back further. In a very specific sense, the longest-running doom band is Pentagram, who have been playing in pretty much the same style since 1971. Most fans agree, however, that the scene takes it's name from Candlemass' Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. \u000a\u000aDoom as a reasonably well-defined scene goes back to the early 90's at least, but this sort of depends on *where* you're talking about. Chicago for the most part always had a doom scene, with St. Vitus and Trouble playing there with regularity since the mid-80's. London and Manchester both have doom scenes that go back that far as well. 
p4911
aVThere's a really good documentary on this! You can watch the trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyJ2nZGUfcY). I'm sure you can watch this movie online somewhere. I found it very enjoyable and I learned a couple of things too.
p4912
aVsup.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkdmwKXNXAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkdmwKXNXAQ)
p4913
aVI have seen it recently. I'm talking less about which band started when,  but when people like us came together and started grouping these bands together, I'm sure by the late 80s.
p4914
aVI think that the *current* doom scene popped up in the last few years due to streaming services. Until then it was always hard to find out much about doom because there was almost no media coverage and most record stores didn\u2019t carry the albums. So just because you liked Sleep or UFOmammut doesn\u2019t mean you would learn about the other. But then Pandora, Last.fm, and Spotify turned up and in an hour you could find out about more doom bands than you\u2019d heard of in a decade. \u000a\u000aOf course there were other doom scenes before this. But as several other posters already pointed out, those were local scenes.
p4915
aVIn NWOBHM there's more than a few bands (Witchfinder General, Pagan Altar, Requiem, Tellurian) that shared a similar doomy sound but weren't united in any geographical sense (different English towns etc) or shared any identity. A lot of acts we consider staples of doom have never called themselves by that label, or only accept that category for convenience given that they share the sound with other bands.\u000a\u000aI see Warning and 40 Watt Sun posted here often but Patrick Walker insists neither band plays doom metal, even though the former were signed to the Miskatonic Foundation which specialised in distributing UK doom and darker NWOBHM.\u000a\u000aI remember some of Cathedral's early albums having a list of similar bands they respected, and that sort of thing was key to finding doom metal in the days before internet streaming. Years and years ago I went looking for Moss after seeing the hail in *Come My Fanatics*... and, though I was disappointed with the quality of what I heard, I felt a loyalty to support them given that it was hard to find that sort of music.\u000a\u000aAnd I guess that's also why we post a lot of sludge, drone, stoner and occult here. Esoteric had a squabble with Electric Wizard in the 90s where they denounced them for not being true doom but they play funeral anyway lol. \u000aIt's pointless to fuss over what is and isn't doom because that's such a nebulous idea and there's no historical doom ideology shared by all doomy bands. People who got into doom yesterday have it so easy. There's every band under the sun on the internet. It's beautiful.
p4916
aVDoom analysis on point tho
p4917
aVProbably around the time of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus by Candlemass.
p4918
aVI knew a guy in high school, around 1997 or so, who lent me some metal tapes including Sleep and Mindrot. I remember him using the name doom metal, so it would have been by then at least.\u000a\u000a...and I just found out the drummer from Mindrot wound up in Save Ferris. Would not have guessed that.

Instrumental doom with a viola. \u000a\u000aAre you into stoner rock/metal at all? Because there are lots of great albums in that genre that are mostly instrumental. A lot lean towards the psychedelic stoner/doom side.\u000a\u000a* [Craang - To The Estimated Size Of The Universe](https://craang.bandcamp.com/album/to-the-estimated-size-of-the-universe) (The Meteorian in particular, is amazing)\u000a* [Elder - Spires Burn](https://beholdtheelder.bandcamp.com/album/spires-burn-release) (Elder is one of the best stoner bands out there IMO)\u000a* [Yuri - Gargain](https://yurigagarinswe.bandcamp.com/album/yuri-gagarin-2014-remix) (completely instrumental)

aVSerpent Throne. The have an album called "Ride Satan, Ride," which is supposed to be the long lost soundtrack to a 70' s satanic biker movie. It's fucking killer stuff. They have a few other albums, and they are all good, but that one - in my opinion - is fully brilliant. I believe that all the albums are instrumental.

aVBack when Napster was a thing I just started discovering metal, I heard a sample from a track from the Chilean band also named Pentagram, [Fatal Predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjseTSuqGVY) and was completely blown away. I had to hear more of those guys. I opened up Napster and searched pentagram and downloaded a few of their songs to listen to (I get that that's kind of fucked up but I was 13 at the time and file sharing was sort of new). After waiting hours upon hours my song was finished downloading, I eagerly clicked play, and to my surprise it was some band from the 70's with the same name that I just wasn't feeling at all.\u000a\u000aYears later when I started getting into doom I decided to give this band a go one more time and became instantly hooked. Pentagram (USA!) kicks so much ass. This is one of my favorite songs by them as well as 20 Buck Spin (that solo!)\u000a\u000aThe Chilean Pentagram also kicks ass though.

VYpres is a place of several truly dismal, soul crushing battles in World War I with several hundred thousand in casualties. A really fitting doom name.\u000a\u000aBut for what its worth, I don't think I would consider this Doom. It's definitely metal, but there's a lot of speed and sharp guitars. 
p5356
aVYeah, it's definitely the fastest song on the album, the rest of the tracks are pretty doomy. I just think this song is great.

aVPallbearer has some similar melodic riff elements, but the vox are clean.  If you haven't listened to [Sorrow and Extinction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBJfHuyGpsI) yet, you should.  It was the best metal album to come out in 2012, atmo.\u000a\u000aThey also released a [new album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ArNlI5PZSs&amp;list=PLJ3duizt8tbwf59torcYenoGrCR7yx06f) recently and it's pretty good too, but sounds less like Swallow the Sun than their first.

VSaw them in Denver on Friday and it was an awesome show. Mt Abraxas had to be my favorite live. Fuck it they were all good.
p5432
aVAlso at Denver show. Amazing performance. I really wasn't expecting it to be THAT good. 
p5433
aVI had been waiting for them to come to the states for about 2 years and it totally lived up to my expectations.  I only wish they were selling the runaway girls 7" on tour. What'd you think of Danava? 
p5434
aVI thought they kicked ass. I'm not a huge fan of their albums, they all seem like they are missing that 'something'. And now I know that the 'something' is their stage presence, probably mixed with a healthy dB increase. And they put out a really positive atmosphere, sort of like Iron Maiden does. Which made the contrast to UA&amp;D that much better. UA has their stage down nailed down tight, they definitely know how to create a certain atmosphere. 
p5435
aVI hadn't heard Danava before the show, but I liked them enough to buy a couple of their albums afterward and have to say I agree. The albums sound kind of (deliberately?) flat compared to the live performance. Parts of it were pretty engrossing.
p5436
aVBe prepared dude. They rocked Philly so hard.

p5444
aVDude, if you haven't really delved into them, check out October Rust. It's a bit more accessible than some of their other stuff, but just as awesome. Also their last album, Dead Again, is phenomenal. Every song has like 10 great riffs in them. World coming down is also a great song, and album. If you couldn't tell, I fucking love Type O. Peter Steele was a great songwriter and musician.
p5445
aVShit yeah, I should listen to more of them. I listened to 3 or 4 tracks off of October Rust and the synths are killer. The lyrics are kind of bananas too. I feel like my opinion that they take themselves too seriously has been totally squashed.
p5446
aVPerfect winter music!
p5447
aVBrilliant! I would NOT be on this sub right now if it hadn't been for these guys.

aV[Windhand](http://windhandva.bandcamp.com/) is the closest I can think of off hand.\u000a\u000aNot quite Electric Wizard sounding but also worth a look are [The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16A9ELSEWPA), [Acid King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6eNI3r2gEI), [Witch Mountain](http://witchmountain.bandcamp.com/album/cauldron-of-the-wild), [Uzala](http://uzala.bandcamp.com/album/tales-of-blood-fire-2). If you're ok with sludge vocals [Salome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb0uzILAYC0) is pretty good.
p5529
aVHmmm, Jex Thoth and SubRosa come to mind, but I'm not sure if that is exactly what you're looking for. Check out SubRosa's second album and see how you like it.
p5530
aVNot entirely Electric Wizard-y but serious genre pushing, powerful doom music.\u000a\u000a[Subrosa](https://subrosausa.bandcamp.com/) kicks serious ass.  They make regular use of violins and clean vocals.  Their music is just absolutely gorgeous and delivers on the heavy when it needs too.  The lead singer will also tend to push a lot of volume with her voice, she has an interesting and distinct sound that doesn't break in to outright yelling.  There's still plenty of harmonies and typically clean vocals.\u000a\u000a"Ghosts of a Dead Empire" is probably a great introduction, but the entire album "More Constant than the Gods" is fucking gorgeous.\u000a\u000a
p5531
aVI second this. I just discovered SubRosa recently and have become hooked. Clean female vocals over deep crushing doom is something else. Perfect combination.

aVAcid King and Windhand. You also might be interested in Uncle Acid, as the guy sounds like a chick.

p5536
aVThe Oath, Blood Ceremony, Royal Thunder and Electric Citizen all come to mind.
p5537
aV[Thorr's Hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ57PS-5bhM) is great (yup, that's two r's). It has both clean female vocals and growling male ones.\u000a\u000a[Avrigus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAxi-BFhO_I) might be something to check out as well, it's some sort of "symphonic ambient doom" according to MA.\u000a\u000aClean female vocals doesn't seem to be super common in doom, but there are about eight billion occult rock bands nowadays with clean female vocals. Might be something to check out, even if it's usually not super heavy. Perhaps consider looking around in /r/occultrock

p5562
aVI think it's the story of Genesis. I watched it a long time ago, on youtube probably. It's creepy for sure, largely in part to do its lack of music. There's lots of gore, but its an interesting story. 
p5563
aV[deleted]
p5564
aVThe movie is one of my favorites, but it takes a great deal of patience. There is no dialog of any kind so you have to piece the story together with your imagination. The symbolism in the movie is great and it always leaves me with a happy feeling at the end for some reason. Highly recommended.

aVShe is also in the funeral doom band 'Remembrace', very recommended 
p5590
aVChecked them out after looking for similar bands. Definitely also worth a listen.
p5591
aVI feel like the guitar tone is making me think black metal, at least this new post-black wave of it.  It lacks the heavy rumble I would associate with doom.  I think this sits better next to Deafheaven, Myrkur and Wolves in the Throne Room  more than Windhand, Dark Castle or Subrosa.  \u000a\u000aI dig it.  It's definitely the relaxing kind of metal I'm increasingly fond of these days, but it doesn't seem doomy to me.  If that's how they're being labeled I think it's silly, and a detriment to sensible genre labeling.  \u000a\u000a
p5592
aVIs this doom? Sounds more like progressive metal and stuff.
p5593
aVMetal Storm and Metal Archives group them as Atmospheric doom.
p5594
aVWow I really enjoyed that. I agree with MongoAbides, I was thinking a touch of blackened guitar tones more than doom also I don't get that heaviness I associate with it. Regardless the vocals are beautiful and I will be checking out some of the other albums. Thanks for sharing!

p5632
aVThe majority of their discography is 7inch splits, so most MP3s/vids are sourced from those.  These guys have been kicking it since the early 90s, I like to think that many of the guttural bands take their cue from Corrupted.\u000a\u000aHere are a few other tracks I really like though:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpX9pP-jMl0\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4xiAffLkXU\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz7A8XjUSZw\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSX1ymz8y9Y\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHfnHMeSj8w\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpr7vGFWjE\u000a\u000aHere's a track from a CD release:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaKy_mEGiBU\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you'd like high fidelity, then I would like for you to listen to their epic masterpiece El Mundo Frio.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgPUqdOsU5U\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThey're a Japanese band and their policy in the 90s was no pictures, no interviews, all words/vocals in Spanish.

Not to mention bands like Om, where I could just meditate on my thoughts and put them back together coherently.  My wife loved Opeth, so of course, I would avoid them, and listen to other stuff, like Old Silver Key, and Drudkh proper.  Solace in what you understand, in what many understand, the doom will always be there for you, in good times and in bad, this is the conduit to place you at the bottom of the pit, but also help you to the top.  May the greyest of days and the darkest of nights forever envelop you.
