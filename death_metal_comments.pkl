V* Autopsy\u000a* Entombed\u000a* Cianide\u000a* Coffins\u000a* Early Morbid Angel\u000a* Morbus Chron\u000a* Bolt Thrower\u000a* Grave\u000a* Convulse\u000a\u000aYoutube can show you a million songs by any of these bands and Metal Archives can help you figure out what album/era of the band to listen to. I didn't want to link to anything cause I don't know what about death metal attracts you so I didn't want to taint your experience with my own perceptions. Enjoy exploring this often misunderstood and amazing form of music!

VWhy are you posting Discharge to this subreddit? Discharge is absolutely not Death Metal.
p573
aVI agree, but it's the most influential band on death metal besides metal itself.
p574
aVSo? It's not death metal. As a moderator of this subreddit, I'd expect you to realize that posting punk to the a death metal subreddit was... stupid.
p575
aVHistory of death metal is quite important, and bands like Discharge, GBH, the Exploited, Amebix, Cro-mags and others feature prominently.
p576
aVYeah... uh, I've been a punk since.. well, I don't want to date myself, but let's assume it's been a rather long time.  I know that hardcore influenced metal, mainly thrash, but to say that the roots of death metal are tied to bands like GBH or The Exploited is just fucking retarded.  I can see the relationship between crust and death metal, so I understand your Amebix comparison, but to suggest that Cro-Mags or other NYHC bands influenced death metal's sounds is just fucking absurd. Same with old streetpunk acts like GBH or The Exploited.  Death Metal comes to us via thrash, which in turn spawned out of the same scenes that punk did.  I'd have to be a complete fucking moron to start posting tracks from UK82 records to a death metal subreddit and assume it would be on-topic. The history of death metal has nothing to do with streetpunk like GBH or The Exploited, at least not directly. The foundations of death metal come from thrash and grindcore. Grindcore comes out of the crust scene, which came out of the punk scene, but that would be the equivalent of posting jazz to the powerviolence subreddit because jazz influenced rock influenced punk influenced hardcore influenced powerviolence.  I could understand comparing bands like early Napalm Death, or some Extreme Noise Terror, to death metal.  But GBH? Fuck no. That's just *stupid*.\u000a

VThere\u2019s two ways to answer this question depending on what exactly you\u2019re asking. \u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re trying to pick out the lyrics from listening to the vocals, good luck. Many are completely incomprehensible without the written lyrics. As you listen more (and listen while reading) you should start to develop something of an ear for it, but frankly the words themselves are usually secondary to the rhythm and texture of the vocal line. Rather than trying to pick out words to sing along with, like you would in a pop song, pay attention to the flow of the vocals, where they are prominent and where they rest, etc etc. If you\u2019re a musician, think about it not like a sung vocal line but rather another instrument layered into the music. In most death metal that\u2019s worth your time, the vocals do not lead the song but comment on it, so it can be one of your lesser concerns in appreciating the music.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re asking how to appreciate and explicate the lyrics (which is what I think you\u2019re getting at), the answer is a little more complex. First, it\u2019s important to understand how metal uses symbolism and what songs tend to be about in a subtextual sense. Lyrics about demons, serial killers, warfare, etc are the norm, but why? One of the biggest differences between extreme/underground metal and rock/pop music is going to be important here. Pop music is about the individual experience: \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m in love\u201d, or \u201cmy friends and I are going to party this weekend\u201d. Even most political rock songs (i.e. punk) tend to be protesting specific issues: \u201cthis war is bad\u201d, \u201cthe government is doing X to its citizens\u201d (it\u2019s worth mentioning here that Napalm Death is a grindcore band, and lyrically rooted more in hardcore punk and crust than most death metal).  Heavy metal, from the earliest days of Black Sabbath, tends to avoid this. It frames the individual in the context of greater and larger forces of history, society, mythology, etc. Rock has always celebrated the individual (typically positive aspects), where metal examines the larger composition of reality and is not afraid to acknowledge the negative or \u201cevil\u201d aspects of existence. \u000a\u000aWhat this means is that you should approach the lyrical content of death metal the same way you approach a horror movie, or Gothic literature (a form of Romanticism). In fact, it is extremely common for metal lyrics to reference or be directly inspired by this sort of art, and tends to function in a similar way, and being well-read and well-watched will enrich your understanding immensely. The works of modernist/Gothic author HP Lovecraft explore the notion that humanity is a very small and insignificant part of a reality that is horrific and incomprehensible to us and is ultimately not under our control\u2014stories like \u201cThe Call of Cthulu\u201d and \u201cThe Rats in the Walls\u201d. Horror/exploitation movies such as \u201cThe Last House on the Left\u201d force us to confront aspects of humanity and ourselves that we would often rather ignore like torture, rape and revenge. George Romero\u2019s original \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d partitions its cast into two groups: those who can deal with the terror they face and those who cannot. Mary Shelly\u2019s masterpiece \u201cFrankenstein\u201d explores the morality and ethical pitfalls of science (and its connections with the alchemists of ages past) and the existential dread of being alone in an indifferent universe. We could go on forever: Milton\u2019s \u201cParadise Lost\u201d and its casting of Satan as an anti-hero; Robert E. Howard\u2019s Conan the Barbarian; works of philosophy by men like Crowley, Jung or Nietzche; Tolkien in its entirety; religious or esoteric works like Norse mythology, Gnosticism, chaos magick, etc etc etc. \u000a\u000aMetalheads have a reputation of being brash, uneducated thugs, and this is very unfair. A lot people who are very involved with underground metal are intelligent, well-read persons, who desire to explore and understand the world around them rather than escape it. While the lyrics of death metal may deal with fantastic or fictional topics, they are usually less escapist than your average popular music. As such, if you want to understand what metal is about (and importantly, WHY), you need to get in a similar mindset. Though they are sometimes derided for being too elitist, the Death Metal Underground (linked in the sidebar) has some very good articles along the lines of what I\u2019ve said above.\u000a\u000aFinally, since you say you\u2019re a new listener here\u2019s a short list of high-quality metal songs with good lyrics that you can get to work unraveling:\u000a\u000a-Celtic Frost \u201cCircle of the Tyrants\u201d (the struggle of modern man to create something greater than the petty individual) \u000a\u000a-Slayer \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d (warfare framed as a mythological Satanic war, basically an updated version of \u201cWar Pigs\u201d by Sabbath)\u000a\u000a-Morbid Angel \u201cFall From Grace\u201d (taken straight from Milton\u2019s \u201cParadise Lost\u201d)\u000a\u000a-Immolation \u201cNailed to Gold\u201d (was the suffering of Jesus a sacrifice to save our souls\u2026or something else?)\u000a\u000a-Deicide \u201cDead by Dawn\u201d (don\u2019t make me explain this one!)\u000a\u000a-Unleashed \u201cOnward into Countless Battles\u201d (remember when Scandanavia was the home of the Viking hordes? Unleashed does)\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Metal is not about individual experience. It\u2019s about reality, the \u201cbig picture\u201d and not ignoring the unpleasant parts of life. It\u2019s also much more literary than pop music, and if you want to understand it properly you need to be versed in history, literature, and mythology. If you want to be able to understand the words while they\u2019re being said\u2026you might want to listen to something else.\u000a
p637
aVThanks. Greatly appreciated. 
p638
aV&gt; how do I appreciate or understand the lyrics\u000a\u000aRead the lyrics and develop an ear.  The biggest gripe I have with morons who complain about not understanding the lyrics of extreme metal is that they assume lyrics are important. They are using as an atmospheric instrument, just like the guitar.  What is said is often irrelevant. If you want to know what they're saying, learn to decipher what's being said, or read the lyrics. If you think the lyrics need to be appreciated, perhaps you should go listen to some shitty singer singing about shit.\u000a\u000aIf you think understanding the lyrics matters, then metal is not for you.

p790
(lp791
VAs a regular reader of deathmetal.org, I'm pretty disappointed by their recent obsession with "#metalgate".  I'd say I'm pretty representative of most visitors to their site: I follow a few other blogs and lurk in a couple metal forums, but I'm not the most widely read in current-metal-events.  However: I don't hear about this phenomenon anywhere else on the internet.  Nobody else cares.  Seriously, this obsessive victimization of metal being "infiltrated" seems pretty invented.  Yeah, NPR/Pitchfork casual metal listeners might find novelty vegan/feminist/christian/LGBTQ psudo-metal bands a fun novelty and download a record or two before going back to their Fugazi worship.  But nobody who actually listens to metal even knew or cared about those bands to begin with.  Why feel threatened?  Why write several articles every week giving us the latest update on this "crusade"?

On this day, metalheads worldwide stop the pointless activities of a boring world and listen to Slayer.\u000a\u000aInternational Day of Slayer is bigger than one nation, or even one band. It's a celebration of metal music through one of its most articulate spokesbands. It's also revelry in the spirit that makes metal great. So on June 6, stop everything... and listen to SLAYER!\u000a\u000ahttp://www.nationaldayofslayer.org/
