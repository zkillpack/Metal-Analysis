sVRecording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?
p6
VFor years I have been recording crudely, slapped together pieces with a very rudimentary setup. Needless to say, there is a lot that can be improved even for a home recording. \u000a\u000aCurrently I am using:\u000a\u000aApex 435 Wide Diaphragm Studio Microphone\u000a\u000athis is the mic for my Line 6 spider valve 212 bogner tube amp, currently no noisegate or added pedals. (tone isn't great)\u000a\u000athis all goes through my Tascam US-122L USB 2.0 digital interface\u000a\u000aAs far as software, Reaper is an easy click and record program, sometimes this is imported to Adobe Audition 3.0. The effects interface on this program blows. I don't own a copy of pro tools sadly.\u000a\u000aFruity loops for drum tracks. The hits from the drum kit from hell used with EZdrummer most frequently, can be used in this program though there are much better sounding alternatives.\u000a\u000aLately (harsh) vocals are slowly making their debut into the tracks.\u000a\u000aThat's pretty much it, I'd like to know what other people use because I'm at a point where learning new techniques or software would make the best of what I can record.\u000a\u000aIt's a bit embarrassing to tell other metal musicians about my setup, I do the best with what I've got and I'm hopeful some of you can help with suggesting equipment, software or anything from your experience.\u000a\u000aThanks in advance.

sVCab simulator problems in Reaper
p12
VHey guys. I'm pretty new to music-making in general, so forgive me if I sound like an idiot. \u000a\u000aTo create my heavy guitar tone in Reaper, I used [this guide](http://www.santoclemenzi.com/?p=839&amp;lang=en) and followed it exactly, figuring it was better to get a tone like the author's and adjust from there rather than figure out every detail of the settings for myself. Well... mostly. I held off on the cabinet simulator at first, thinking I might not need it. \u000a\u000aEverything was fine, but I knew the tone wasn't what I wanted, so I downloaded the same cab sim and IRs the author used, set it up the same way, and tried it out. The result was a definite improvement in tone... but now when I try to play more than one track at a time, the playback gets really glitchy and skips, slows down, etc. I used the Performance Meter and Windows Task Manager to confirm that it's a CPU problem. Disabling the cab sim on the tracks removes the problem. I guess Poulin LeCab is a CPU hog. \u000a\u000aMy question is: what do I do about this? Is there another cab sim that works as well, but wouldn't use so much CPU? And if I'm doomed to glitchy playback when I play multiple tracks, how am I supposed to write an entire song and hear how it all sounds together?

sVVocal stomp boxes - trying to thicken up my sound
p14
VI've found in the past that I run into issues with my vocal style for screaming/growling vocals. Most often this manifests itself as screams/growls that come out quiet and require a lot of use of the gain knob. Trying to use this method, however, often results in clean vocals that come out with lots of distortion and/or feedback. I've been looking into getting a vocal stomp box so that i can switch back and forth between high gain/low gain inputs. This would be a be a lot easier if I could use a guitar stomp box but I think I'll run into issues with the low z input mics produce.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind that I'm hoping to use this mostly for live performances so I'll most often be using an SM58 dynamic mic. Has anyone here tried using any vocal stomp boxes with gain controls or maybe compression controls?

sVMixing 2 Guitar and Bass Tones
p38
VHope you can help,\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI record metal, which requires multiple guitars. However, when I record my rhythm and lead, the product doesn't sound together. For example, in a professional song, you can't really tell the two guitars apart 100% of the time. However, when I record, the guitars sound too separated and they don't mix well into one overall sound. Even the bass sounds distant/separated from the mix.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI play to a metronome, use the same tones, combine the tracks, put it in the leveler to direct where each guitar goes in the speaker, mess with tracks on my recording software, and they still sound too separate. It's not my playing either, I'm on-time but the guitars don't sound together/mixed well. I hope you know what I mean.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAre there any tips/tricks/methods to recording multiple guitars so that they form a powerful overall sound instead of all separate? Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.

sVMetal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?
p40
VI figured metal musicians would get the most doubt in our career choice...it takes A LOT of time and practice. It takes serious love and appreciation. It's a fucking hard genre to write and perform. But it makes me wonder...how many of my favorite musicians pushed through the doubt to get where they are today? Theres the young and talented metal musician Scott Carstairs of Fallujah or Alex Rudinger who just turned 24 a couple days ago...how much doubt did they endure? Because both of them are fucking amazing...and older than me by just a couple years!\u000a\u000aI don't know, I'm receiving a lot of doubt right now from my family because they think becoming a touring metal musician is a pipe dream. It's not like I wanna be a world famous rock star...fuck that. \u000a\u000aSo...who plays metal and who keeps playing through all the haters? I do.

sVMetal Theory #1, pt. 2: Iced Earth - Dante's Inferno (x-post from r/metal)
p92
V[Inquiry Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1vemyw/any_interest_in_music_theory_analysis_of_metal/)\u000a\u000a[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1wy50n/metal_theory_1_pt_1_iced_earth_dantes_inferno/)\u000a\u000aSo this has definitely turned into a much longer thing than I had originally anticipated. Once I got started working on the second part, posted below, I decided that I didn't want this analysis to spill over to a third post, and at some point I would cut-off the riff-by-riff analysis, take a look at how the song ends, and post what I've got. There are a few reasons for that. One, by this point, most of the techniques and concepts that characterize the song have already been introduced and established. That's just a natural result of good songwriting; if Schaffer was constantly introducing new harmonic concepts, the music would lose cohesion and sound like a sequence of unrelated stuff. Two, I have enough information to draw some conclusions about the song as a whole. And three, I think spilling over to a third post would strain my attention span and that of my audience. There's lot's of metal out there that I want to look at and I'm eager to get to the next thing. And the more of these I do, the more connections I'll be able to draw between them.\u000a\u000aAgain, please let me know if you've enjoyed this and want me to do more, or if you have any questions or thoughts. Also feel free to post requests for the next song for me to look at. I'll probably go with whatever one gets the most upvotes. If, along with your request, you post a question or something about that song you'd like me to look at specifically, so much the better.\u000a\u000aSo here's the remainder of the riff-by-riff, followed by my conclusions (in the comments) about how this song is structure and what makes it work musically.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe left off at 5:24. They've switched to clean guitar tones, and a reduction in tempo. There's an Eb minor arpeggio repeating four times before a chord progression comes in along with the vocals. Chord progression (with chords changing every two bars) is Ebm | Gb9/Db | Cbmaj7no3 | Ebm, which is i-bIII-bVI-i, which is a series of tonics and tonic substitutes (in terms of harmonic function, chords built on the third and sixth degree of the scale are considered variations on, or substitutes for, the tonic chord). The last chord has a phrygian lick at the end. Vocals are following the fifths, except on the last chord, where they move to Eb. Cool thing is that the bass moves down by whole steps and then jumps down (along with the vocals) a minor sixth to the last Eb, which sounds particularly doomy. Halfway through, they add another acoustic guitar arpeggiation an octave above the first, following the same chord progression but with a 3:2 rhythm that resolves after two bars. Strangely, the second guitar is playing the second chord as a Db major, leading to a possible reinterpretation of the first chord as Db6sus4. With the second guitar, it could be interpreted perhaps as Db6add4? Third chord for the second guitar is B, which fits within the established harmonic framework, and then it follows the Eb Phrygian lick. \u000a\u000aKey change! Only the second one since the introduction. Now we're in F# minor (which we're using instead of Gb minor, which is a theoretical key with nine flats that is never used in practice). Diatonic modulation to F# from Eb would indicated F# *major*, but the riff (another quasi-polyrhythmic gallop riff) uses a lick that goes from the fifth to the minor sixth, indicating a minor mode. So we've got a chromatic thirds relationship to the original key, a tonal shift which is mostly found in impressionist music and modal jazz. It's also interesting to note that Schaffer effectively exhausted the modal possibilities for Eb and then returned to Phrygian before blasting off to another key. Then we've got another Metallica-esque sliding power chord riff, following an F# minor melody, and implying the chord progression, i-ii-i-iv-bIII. \u000a\u000aThen we've got a twin guitar harmony lead over the rhythm guitar. One guitar is following the root movement, and the second is harmonizing in diatonic thirds. Very Iron Maiden. Aside from octaves, thirds are probably the most popular choice for harmonizing a melody.  The resulting sound tends to be epic and majestic. This is a diatonic harmonization, which means that the harmonized line uses both major and minor thirds to stay within the F# minor mode. A chromatic harmonization (such as was used at the end of the introduction) would use all minor or all major thirds, freely playing notes outside of the mode. \u000a\u000aNext riff is similar, another sliding power chord riff, this time using harmonic minor with the leading tone. Since Schaffer is using an unaltered power chord, with a perfect fifth over the leading tone, rather than the diminished fifth that would normally appear there, this is a good illustration of exactly what power chords are. They're not chords in the traditional sense because they don't have any inherent directionality, and they're not constructed from a modal framework the way major and minor chords are. Rather, they're a means of beefing up a single-note line through chromatic harmonization in parallel fifths.\u000a\u000aNext we've got chanting vocals following the bass line, F# to F natural. That's a trope that Iced Earth has used in a few other places, such as "Damien" on Horror Show. I believe it shows up quite a bit elsewhere in the metal world, but I can't think of any examples from other bands offhand. Guitar riff in minor; still no thirds, but it's got minor sixths. This time, the exchange is facilitated by the riff playing a *real* (as opposed to *tonal*) sequence. Similar concept to what I was talking about above with diatonic and chromatic harmonization. A sequence is just a transposition of a melody, repeating it at a higher or lower pitch. Rather than transposing the riff along the harmonic minor scale, they're just moving the entire thing without transposing any of the intervals (the F natural part of the sequence uses a C natural, which is not in the key of F# minor). This also means that they're tonicizing the leading tone during that part of the sequence, temporarily turning it into the tonally-central note. \u000a\u000a8:43 brings a reduction in tempo and a significant shift of rhythmic texture. Bass is playing a transposition of the tonic/leading tone movement in the last section, this time C# to C natural, so now we're in C# minor. The rhythm guitar is playing inverted (fifth in the bass) C# power chords and the lead guitar is playing a melody note over the chords that moves from A (minor sixth, minor ninth above the bass) to G#. When the bass shifts to C natural, the melody notes transpose as well with a rhythmic alteration: the perfect fifth is coming on the strong beat and the minor sixth on the weak beat. This creates a cool little tonally chromatic melody (it's tonal relative to the chords it's playing over, but chromatic as a line), which is joined by another lead guitar doubling an octave above, which then harmonizes the melody at the 12th. \u000a\u000aNext riff is a rhythmic variation on that melody and harmonic progression with half-spoken vocals. And that puts us up to 9:45. \u000a\u000aThe first thing that struck me about the next section was how harmonically unstable it sounds. We're about 2/3 of the way through, which is a good place (as per the golden ratio, which is shows up a lot in music) for a more harmonically unstable section, since that creates tension, which is a good thing to have when you're building up to some sort of climax. The rhythm guitar is playing a melody on inverted power chords, B-Db-Bb three times, and then that plus an Eb. That inverted power chord--a chord with a root and a fifth, and the fifth in the bass--has shown up in a few other places throughout this song. Any chord with a fifth in the bass is going to be somewhat unstable, since the perfect fourth formed by the bass and the root is, functionally speaking, a dissonance. Unlike the previous sections, here the bass guitar is doubling the fifth of each chord rather than the root, which amplifies that instability. Also, the first chord of this section is a tritone away from the last chord of the previous section, which I think prevents this section from "inheriting" the tonality of the previous section. Despite the harmonic instability, the first three bars seem to imply Bb, and then in the last bar everyone's plays the Eb in unison so that's not so much implied as stated explicitly, which means this section is both creating tension in anticipation of a climax and leading us back to Eb as the tonic. \u000a\u000aNext section is clean, back in Eb land. Just a little transition to establish the tonality before things kick into high gear. Of note, this lick has both the minor second of Phrygian and the major second of Aeolian (the natural minor scale), although never on top of each other, so this is a good example of how to implement chromatic color tones in a very tonal way. When the distortion kicks in, the riff mostly follows the same pattern as the last one, using  the Phrygian minor seconds throughout and the Aeolian major seconds at the end.\u000a\u000aAt 10:49, we've got a riff that starts in Eb minor and then jumps to A natural, a tritone leap.  And since nothing else is going on that would indicate that it's derived from diminished or Locrian harmony, this is just one of those free tritones that makes metal sound like metal. One might think of these sorts of tritones, as they appear throughout metal, as being derived from the blues, which also tends to throw tritones around rather freely. Difference is, the blues tend to use tritones as chromatic passing notes, while metal tends to just hang out on the tritone (as we see here) or even (as in the case of the opening riff of "Black Sabbath") use it as a point of arrival.

sVQuestions about using Reaper as my DAW?

VI've been writing and recording music for a while now and it's going pretty well! I've been using Ableton Live Lite 8, but recently, due to it being the Lite version, the track number limitation and effect limitation (EQ and things) have been holding me back a bit.\u000a\u000aSo I'm considering purchasing Reaper, since it's pretty damn cheap. I was hoping some people here could answer some questions about it before I buy it!\u000a\u000a1) Does it support VST plugins such as EZDrummer and Poulin LeCab for impulses?\u000a\u000a2) Does it have its own built in EQ/Compressor plug-ins to apply to the tracks?\u000a\u000a3) Is there any limitation to the number of tracks you can have in one project? (Ableton limits it to 8). Same question for number of plug-ins and effects running. (Ableton limits plug-ins to 4 and effects such as EQ to 6).\u000a\u000a4) Are there any built-in synth string/piano MIDI instruments that you can use with it, or somewhere where you can download such things for it?\u000a\u000aBit of a wordy post I know, but hopefully someone knows a bit about Reaper!

p116
VHey guys, I'm in the process of recording vocals to finish my band's doom album. Thing is, me and the other bandmates don't know what we're doing, all of us sound pretty horrible taking on vocals. We mainly have concerns about mixing, but improving amature vocals is really our main goal here.\u000a\u000aHere's me on a couple of takes:\u000a\u000a1\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/vincent_wisehoon/pblsample1\u000a\u000a2\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/vincent_wisehoon/pblsample2\u000a\u000aSo here's the thing: My voice is obviously not that great, but I felt it at least fits the theme of weakness and sounds frail enough for a doom album. But there are still things I could do to capitalize on that effect. So for both takes, there is a boost in the high-mids for that radio'd type nasally sound, which I'm okay with I guess, but is there a way to get the vocals to sound more dry and up front without making it painfully obvious that my technique isn't good? \u000a\u000aSecond, I like the tone of the first take more, but I barely sung on that, it was really more of a loud talking. When I put the real power into my voice in the second take, I don't think any of it came through. I was obviously more prepared the second time, and it shows in the rhythm and intonation, but when I was sloppier, it sounded nicer. Do I not have to necessarily belt out all my singing?\u000a\u000aFinally, for both takes (I believe), I mildly reduced the volume of some of the guitar tracks at periods where I was singing. Is this a good idea? Someone told me I don't want my vocals to fight with the frequencies making up the guitars and distortion (obviously), but that makes me wonder how a band like Electric Wizard can have tons of loudness and distortion and still lay vocals on top of that. That's why I went with the school of just making them sound thin and frail, but they're still pretty unclear. Basically I don't know whether or not I should be messing with the volumes of everything else to make the vocals pop out.\u000a\u000aI'm pretty sue if we can't figure this out we're going to start hunting the internet for someone who can actually sing.

sVLet's Talk Bass, Week II: Gear!
p119
VWelcome back to Let's Talk Bass. I'll try and keep this a weekly thing as much as I can.\u000a\u000a[Link to Week I: The Bassics, for those who missed it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalmusicians/comments/1ygkgk/lets_talk_bass_week_i_the_bassics/)\u000a\u000aSo, as promised, this week we're going to talk about gear. I'm splitting this up into four major parts: **Bass Guitars**, **Amps**, **Strings**, and **Effects**. So, let's rock and roll.\u000a\u000a**BASS GUITARS**\u000a\u000aThere's a running gag on [Talkbass](http://www.talkbass.com) (which you should totally go to, by the way) that goes simply "What's the best bass for metal?" This is because there have been a lot of threads on there about this precise topic. And that's because there is no best bass for metal. Just about every major bass manufacturer has had one of their basses used successfully for metal at some point. Most likely a first bass will be a Precision or Jazz styled bass, so I'm going to cover those, the MusicMan Stingray for its popularity with the modern metal crowd, and a few others.\u000a\u000aThe **Fender Precision Bass** was the first mass-produced bass guitar, and is frequently considered *the* bass for its distinctive low-mid-focussed sound. The P entered metal right from the get-go with Geezer Butler's use of the instrument on pretty much all of the "classic" Sabbath albums (which is to say the first six). [Here is the isolated bass of "After Forever", off Sabbath's third LP *Master of Reality*.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6iUdK1ngiQ)\u000a\u000aAnother famous metal P-bassist was Steve Harris of Iron Maiden. [Here is the isolated bass from "The Trooper," off Maiden's fourth LP *Piece of Mind.*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSYuse9o8KI) As you can hear, the P has a distinctive tone, but it can fit a variety of situations depending on your technique.\u000a\u000aThe **Fender Jazz Bass** was originally marketed as Fender's "deluxe model" bass, with two pickups and a thinner neck designed to appeal to discerning jazz musicians. It didn't catch on in regular jazz, but did in fusion, and also in rock and metal. Geddy Lee of Rush has used a "J-bass" on all of Rush's records since 1993's *Counterparts*, and used it intermittently on *Permanent Waves*, *Moving Pictures*, and *Signals*. [Hear it here on "Tom Sawyer," from the *Moving Pictures* record.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSYuse9o8KI) Just with this, the differences between the P and the J are evident: The J has a much more "forward" tone naturally, which Geddy enhances with heavy amp drive.\u000a\u000aAnother famous user of the J-bass, this time in a more "metal" context, is Greg Christian, formerly of Testament. [Hear him play on "Practice What You Preach," off the record of the same name.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHOJVINZVR0) The J bass's forwardness comes from the pickup close to the bridge, which I think he is soloing (that is, playing with only that pickup on) for this extremely nasal sound.\u000a\u000aOne more Jazz Bass player: [Tim Commerford, of Rage Against the Machine.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nw3gzAnBiA)\u000a\u000aThese are going to be your most likely first choice for a bass. They are the most-copied bass types in the world, and by and large the difference between brands is a matter of construction quality rather than anything very different about the sound. Fender's "Standard" lines, made in Baja California, are generally of good quality for a good price. Squier's "Vintage Modified" basses are also very good quality for the price. These basses can also be found in 5-string configurations.\u000a\u000aThe **MusicMan Stingray** is, while most likely out of the average starting bassist's price range, an excellent bass, and very common in modern metal for its cutting tone. This comes from the bass's single pickup, which is closer to the bridge than the P pickup, and the active preamp in the bass. This allows you to increase or decrease the amount of high end, low end, or midrange in your sound with knobs on the bass. I personally don't use them much, but the tone is perfectly serviceable at flat. [Here is Johnny Christ of Avenged Sevenfold using a Stingray (might be a Sterling, its smaller cousin) on the track "Afterlife," from the *City of Evil* record.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nw3gzAnBiA) If you can afford a Stingray, I highly recommend it. Unlike the Fenders, I wouldn't recommend going to MusicMan's budget line, as they sacrifice electronics for price, and the active electronics are a big part of the MM sound.\u000a\u000aThe **Rickenbacker 4001/3** is another classic instrument, associated with prog as much as with metal thanks to the likes of Chris Squire and Geddy Lee. The two most famous users of the Rickenbacker in metal are Cliff Burton and Lemmy, who scarcely need introduction. The Rickenbacker's popularity is due to a number of factors, but primarily the consistently high quality of the basses, their distinctive appearance, and the even-more-distinctive sound, with tons of treble and midrange. Not likely to be a beginner bass, however, due to the high price tag. Also, unlike the aforementioned basses, they do not come in 5 strings.\u000a\u000aI would like to recommend against basses with so-called ["soapbar" pickups,](http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u279/splatbass/Instruments/Icon6web.jpg), at least for a first bass, as the electronics behind the active electronics in the lower-end basses can be lousy, requiring replacement to sound good. Plus, I personally find them hard to fit into a mix with a guitar (my personal experience, YMMV).\u000a\u000aA word about 5-string basses and other "extended-range" basses: There is nothing wrong with them. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. 5 strings allow for a much greater range in playing lines that don't exactly follow the guitar (which we'll cover later), and also preclude a need to drop-tune. However, make sure the low B on the bass is of satisfactory quality. Low-priced 5-string basses have awful low B strings. Once again, Squier has a 5-string Jazz bass in its Vintage Modified series, and its low B is generally excellent.\u000a\u000aI will talk about fretless basses later, as they have particular things to note.\u000a\u000a**AMPLIFIERS**\u000a\u000aNow, here's where it gets *really* fun, and by fun I mean confusing. The basics of amplification are thus: You need a lot of wattage to be heard on stage with distorted guitar(s) and drums. Generally over 100 watts. But you don't need that to practice, especially on your own. For solo practice, a small combo amp does well. I recommend Peavey. For a "gigging rig," you generally need a head and a cab.\u000a\u000aThe head is the "business part" of the amplifier, which, generally speaking, is where you do most of the tone shaping. Good brands for metal bass heads include Ampeg, Fender, Hartke, Peavey, and Gallien-Krueger. Stay away from Acoustic and Behringer; they have issues with construction that will result in you spending more money in the long run. Don't worry about tubes: solid-state amps are easier to maintain, lighter, and cheaper. You may want a tube amp later, but solid-state will serve you well, especially early on.\u000a\u000aCabs are the speakers. The gold standard of these is the Ampeg 810 (8 speakers measuring 10 inches), which has been imitated by nearly every other company. The same companies as above are good cab makers. First cab, you probably want to look at a 410 (4 10-inch speakers) instead of the 810. You could also look at a 2x12 cab, or even a 1x15, but the 4x10 will be more efficient at moving air. However, 12-inch and 15-inch speakers have their own characteristics that may be useful.\u000a\u000a**Note:** I advise you to turn the tweeter off in whatever cab you get. It is not needed, and distortion with a tweeter can be highly unpleasant.\u000a\u000a**STRINGS**\u000a\u000aStrings have a bigger impact on your tone and your technique than you might realize. Different strings sound different depending on the *material* and the *construction*. Strings can be divided broadly by these two categories.\u000a\u000aIn terms of construction, you have *roundwound* and *flatwound* strings. Rounds are overwhelmingly the most common type of string used, particularly in metal, due to the rich, often ringing tone. However, many bassists swear by flatwounds for their thick fundamental and smooth feel. Steve Harris uses flatwounds, for instance. Granted he changes them after every show and generally gets a more roundwound-like tone out of them through his technique and amps, but still.\u000a\u000aIn terms of material, you generally have *steel* and *nickel* strings. Steels are brighter than nickels, and in my opinion they have a better sound after the "new" sound wears off. However, steels are much tenser and much rougher on your fingers than nickels.\u000a\u000aGood string brands include Rotosound, D'Addario, Dunlop, DR, and SIT. [This website](http://www.bassstringsonline.com/) is by far the best place to get strings of those brands and more, many more than you could get at a local shop. And for less.\u000a\u000a**EFFECTS**\u000a\u000aThere are a shit ton of effects out there. You don't need much more than a tuner, and possibly a compressor, which will make your tone sound more even dynamically. However, this is metal. You probably want distortion\u000a\u000aWell, be careful about distortion. Most if not all guitar distortion pedals suffer from severe low-end loss and scoop your midrange, meaning your distorted sound will blend with the guitars and disappear in the mix, which will then sound hollow and sloppy. Look for distortions with clean blending options (Boss ODB-3) or derivatives of the Ibanez Tube Screamer (in addition to that, the Digitech Bad Monkey is a surprisingly good choice), which feature strong midrange boosts.\u000a\u000aIf you want only a few effects to experiment with, take the advice of Racer X/The Mars Volta bassist and effects addict Juan Alderete, who recommends fuzz, phaser, and octaver (bass octaver), as those will all show up in the FOH and can be used for many different situations.\u000a\u000aI'm Unfortunately out of characters, so I'm ending here. Thanks for reading. Next time: Writing basslines!

sVMetal Theory #2: Serpentine Path - Crotalus Horridus Horridus
p139
V[Serpentine Path - Crotalus Horridus Horridus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJnPDpKlt4w) \u000a\u000a[Inquiry Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1vemyw/any_interest_in_music_theory_analysis_of_metal/)\u000a\u000a[#1, part 1 - Iced Earth - Dante's Inferno](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1wy50n/metal_theory_1_pt_1_iced_earth_dantes_inferno/)\u000a\u000a[#1, part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalmusicians/comments/1yez5n/metal_theory_1_pt_2_iced_earth_dantes_inferno/)\u000a\u000aI'm aiming for a little bit different format this time around, since the riff-by-riff approach I used for Iced Earth resulted not only in a pretty substantial workload, but two fairly obtuse wall-of-text posts that I think may have clouded some of the key features of the music. Going forward, I'm aiming to be a little more focused.\u000a\u000aIf you've enjoyed this and want me to do more, please let me know. Upvotes are great, but comments are better, and what I'm really hoping for is to get some discussion going. I'm also taking suggestions for the next song, and if you have any questions as to something in that song that you want me to look at specifically, so much the better.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aI'm not sure exactly when I discovered Serpentine Path, although I'm sure it was not long after the release of their self-titled debut album (from which this track is taken). I'm guessing it was one of the review blogs I was following at the time. I'm a sucker for ultra-slow and heavy doom and sludge, and although I really enjoyed this album, for some reason it didn't make it into my regular rotation. I hadn't given it another listen until /u/outtathaway suggested it for the next Metal Theory post, giving me a good chance to get re-acquainted with some excellent heaviness. I've listened to the entire album several times over the last week while I've been working on this and it's been extremely enjoyable. It's a very focused album, bordering on minimalism. There's nothing going on that isn't aimed at creating maximum weight, and uncomplicated though it is, it's hard to argue with something this heavy.\u000a\u000aThe two most notable features of the song are the orchestration choices and the use of the blues minor scale. The term "orchestration" is used specifically to refer to how music is written or arranged for an orchestra, but it can be used more generally to refer to arranging music for any instrument or collection of instruments and making choices about the music based on those instruments' ranges and timbres (timbre meaning sound quality, the thing that makes a note on a piano sound different from the same note played on a flute). That came up in the last analysis as well: Jon Schaffer's use of modal rather than tonal progression was an orchestrational choice, as it allowed him to make full use of the heavy sound of the open E\u266d string.\u000a\u000aLet's take a look at the opening riff of "Crotalus Horridus Horridus" (which is apparently the scientific name of the timber rattlesnake). Note that this is notated *at pitch*. Guitars are transposing instruments and sound an octave lower than written, but since we're talking about pitch in a general sense here rather than relative to specific instruments, this is notated as it would be played on a piano (a non-transposing instrument). This example shows both the guitar (top line) and bass (bottom line).\u000a\u000a[Serpentine Path - Crotalus Horridus Horridus - Riff #1](http://imgur.com/B0rGVhp) \u000a\u000aThat even looks heavy. The notes are so low that I had put put the 8vb on there (meaning: these notes are one octave lower than written, making the distinction above re: notating at pitch somewhat academic) just to get the highest notes on the bottom of the clef. Without the 8vb, the entire thing would be notated on leger lines below the staff.  The lowest note that the bass is hitting is A0, the frequency of which is 27.5 Hz, only a little bit about the lowest note that we're able to hear as a distinct pitch (that being E0, the next E down, one octave below the lowest string on a 4-string bass). At that register, much more of the overtone series of the individual pitches is within the range of human hearing, and those overtones are amplified by the distortion, so there's a huge amount harmonic richness here. This is a big part of what facilitates the music being as uncomplicated as it is; we don't need much because there's so much to hear in every note. \u000a\u000aWe also have a single melodic line that is doubled an octave below--the bass is playing the same part as the guitar, one octave down. This is similar to the Classical orchestral approach to writing bass lines: often the cellos and the double basses will share the bass part, with the basses doubling an octave below. Melodies as well are often doubled across multiple octaves in orchestral writing for a bigger sound. And in this song that effect is used particularly well, especially when the second guitar comes in doubling an octave above, to get Maximum Heavy out of a fairly straightforward idea. No harmony (aside from the harmonic content of the individual notes), not much rhythmic complexity (although I really dig the cymbal accents on the eighth note after the downbeat), just an effective melodic idea made more effective via octave doubling.\u000a\u000aMelodically, all three of the main riffs in this song are structured around a blues approach to the A minor pentatonic scale. That's a very common melodic language in metal, especially in doom and sludge, and can be primarily attributed to the influence of Black Sabbath and the blues lineage from which metal arose. The riff noted above, along with the verse riff (the one played under the vocals when that comes in), make use of one of the key features of the blues: mixed thirds. Most classical and popular music is strictly either major or minor, or alternates between them. Early blues musicians would often play certain notes (usually thirds, fifths, and sevenths) fairly sharp or flat, and as that style got adapted to instruments like the piano (which can't play notes sharp or flat) musicians just used the next note up or down, playing major thirds over minor chords, and minor thirds over major chords, and mixing minor and major thirds (and sevenths, along with similarly inflected fourths and fifths) in melodic lines, as Serpentine Path is doing here. Another riff that comes along later in the song\u2026\u000a\u000a[Serpentine Path - Crotalus Horridus Horridus - Riff #2](http://imgur.com/qTJNton )\u000a\u000a\u2026uses mixed sevenths, which has a similar effect. When something sounds "bluesy," mixed thirds and sevenths are often the reason why.\u000a\u000aThe introductory riff also contains a tritone (D\u266f) as a point of arrival. That's one of those things that makes metal sound like metal. The tritone, due its dissonance and instability, isn't used much in popular music. Until the Baroque era, it was systematically avoided due to its dissonance. In the 17th century it was called *diabolus in musica* ("The Devil in music") and was seen to have "evil" qualities (I've heard some people say that it was outlawed by the Church for this reason, but I've never seen any documentation supporting that). In 18th-century and beyond classical music, and in jazz, the instability of the tritone is used to move from one tonic center to another, so they're transitional. In the blues, as I've mentioned, they're used mostly as passing tones between or inflections of perfect fourths and perfect fifths. Metal is the one genre I know of where that dissonant, evil sound of the tritone is something you resolve *to* rather than *from*.

sVLet's Talk Bass, Week VI: Lead Bass!
p142
VWelcome back to what is, for now, the last installment of this series. This is the last and what should be the most interesting topic to cover, that of "lead bass." This can mean a variety of things. I'm going to divide into three subtopics: *Bass Runs*, *Bass Fills* and *Bass Soloing*. They can overlap, but dividing them should help me work with the individual intricacies of them better.\u000a\u000aA **Bass Run** is essentially a trade from whatever regular line you're playing to something a bit flashy and usually more melodic. To get a better idea of what a bass run is, take a listen to the one, the only, the king (in my opinion) of the bass run....John Deacon!\u000a\u000aBet you didn't see that one coming. If you don't know, John Deacon was the bassist for rock band Queen. He played on all of their albums, and had a distinctly funky, Motown-like approach to both his songwriting and his basslines. For a great example, listen to the first Queen hit he wrote, ["You're my Best Friend."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN_HVup9oOg&amp;noredirect=1). Put on some headphones, 'cause Deacon is using a P with flats. A quintessential sound, but not one that can be heard well on shitty computer speakers. From this alone we can get some ideas of how bass runs work.\u000a\u000aFirst off, there's an undeniable improvisational element to it. At the last, it has to feel improvised, in a way. This doesn't mean you shouldn't practice bass runs, but rather you should practice a variety of runs, so you can throw them into a line without thinking about it for longer than a second.\u000a\u000aSecondly, the run always ends back on the root of the chord. This is important for maintaining consonance; you want to end on a perfectly consonant interval, usually the root of the next chord. As an aside to this, notice that the run never goes over the bar division. If you count it out, in fact, the first bass run Deacon does is in two beats. That's it. It doesn't have to be very flashy at all.\u000a\u000aA **Bass Fill** is very similar to a run, but has a bit more freedom to it. Usually, as I define it, the bass is the primary instrument of a fill for a bar, maybe two, but usually just a bar. Fills can be [simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=oasnbzEMV08#t=189) or [tricky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wO0ikbGvIY0#t=250), or even [trading with drum fills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=LdpMpfp-J_I#t=98). The idea is to keep the groove while adding your own flavor to fill out the sound, since the bass is on its own during one of these sections. You can have a lot of fun with these, but remember to keep the groove. If the song has to pick back up after your fill, you are not keeping the groove. Keep the counter in your head.\u000a\u000aLastly, a **Bass Solo** is longer and more elaborate than either of these. A bass solo can be its own solo spot in a show or in a song, or even a track of its own. Depending on this context, you need to approach bass soloing differently.\u000a\u000aThe band should not always drop out for the bass solo, but they sometimes can, and depending on how much the band is playing, that can affect your choices when soloing. I'm going to further subdivide bass solos into *Comped*, *Semi-Comped*, and *Un-comped*. (Comp is short for accompany, referring to whether other instruments are doing during one instrumentalist's solo.)\u000a\u000a*Comped* solos are when the band is playing behind the solo. Most guitar solos are comped. Some comped bass solos can be found in Trivium's ["Becoming the Dragon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=3rSfGtLzshc#t=229), Metallica's ["Or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMJhOwBLqw#t=102)[ion"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMJhOwBLqw#t=395) (two links there for two solos), and Bad Salad's ["The Second Calling"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrulOZV3uY4#t=471).\u000a\u000aAs you can hear, many of these solos are very guitar-like in their phrasing. This is because with the band comping you (notice how in the Trivium song the guitars are playing a slower riff centered around their low B and locked with the drummer), you actually don't have to maintain the groove. You still need to play in time like a guitarist playing a solo, but you have a bit more freedom. As you can see in the video, Paolo uses some Van Halen-esque tapping techniques to start his solo, Cliff makes whole phrases out of hammer-ons and pull-offs, and Felipe uses some double-stops and simple melodies. These are all viable techniques to use, as well as slap-and-pop and simple fingerpicking.\u000a\u000a*Semi-comped* solos have an accompaniment, but not as much as a fully comped solo. This can refer to a solo that has a staccato, "in-and-out" backing, as in [Metropolis Pt 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaQpC4HuJ5M#t=343) or ["The Dance of Eternity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B1KVGJm1jw#t=186), both by Dream Theater, or with fewer instruments, as in Rush's ["La Villa Strangiato"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UNilsLf6eW4#t=369) where the guitar drops out and only the drums accompany the bass.\u000a\u000aThis is similar to a comped solo, but the bass is a bit more restricted in options. You can't be as guitaristic on the bass in a semi-comped solo. The Dance of Eternity is about as guitar-like as you should be getting, and notice that he still has some groove in it. It's still distinctly a bass solo. Notice that in Strangiato, Geddy stays very firmly in the groove even while soloing. If nobody else is playing except the drums, lock with the drums and groove the solo. Don't be intimidated by the need to groove; it can make your solo more memorable if it's melodic and groovy.\u000a\u000aFinally, *Un-comped Solos* are true solos, where the bass is everything. This is most commonly done as a solo spot during a show, but can also be an album track. [Cliff 'Em All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O9zMnwD65Q&amp;noredirect=1) has some of the best examples of these bass solos. They don't necessarily groove, but something like "Anesthesia" is too Baroque-feeling to need to groove. It can be a welcome respite, too. Another example of this kind of bass solo is [Jason Newsted's solo on Cunning Stunts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wfllKiTthw)\u000a\u000aLastly, here are two good examples of how NOT to do an un-comped bass solo. [Gene Simmons of KISS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUVpPtBeD2g) and [Cronos of Venom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3JKXTj7gw).\u000a\u000aThat's all. This is all I can teach, as far as I know. The rest is up to your own experimentation. Find a good teacher (not a guitar teacher, a bass teacher), find a band, and most of all, GROOVE! Ask me any questions you may have.\u000a\u000aHamlet out. \u005cm/

sVSide-projects: How many do you really need?
p145
VThis could really be a post for all musicians, but I generally find a tendency in the metal community is to have one or more side projects on the go - generally playing in a band, then with one or more side projects.\u000a\u000aNow, the reason to have a project away from a fully-fledged band makes sense - its the idea of collaborating with others (or no one, if it is a one-person thing). However, I find a lot of people ending up with more than one of these, such as a black metal sideproject, a dungeon synth one, an acoustic one, and then an electro one or something, as an example.\u000a\u000aWas just wondering what everyone's thoughts on if this is necessary? Could one really lump all their solo stuff under one moniker, or is employing separate project names a good way of keeping individual and marketing your music?

sVPeople who have had success getting a good sound with VSTs and impulses alone, would you be willing to write up a tutorial on what you do?
p170
VLike many of you I don't have access to thousands of dollars in gear. I've been playing guitar for most of my life and writing for a while. I'm trying to get into recording. Picked up an interface and studio monitors to give myself a little home recording space.\u000a\u000aDespite watching tutorials and reading what I could find I still have a hard time getting a good guitar sound with VSTs alone. I know it's possible to get a good sound, but I feel like the information needed to get started is hard to come by. I've accepted that maybe my guitar and interface maybe aren't that great, but for now it's all I have.\u000a\u000aSo, with that in mind- if you've had success with getting a good guitar tone from VSTs and impulses alone, would you mind taking a few minutes to write up a guide about what works for you? Something along the lines of what plugins do you use? What settings do you use? What's your chain? etc. I would be extremely thankful for that and I'm sure there are other people on this sub who would be interested in this as well, especially those of us who are starting out learning to record.\u000a\u000aedit- I'm specifically referring to guitar tone, but I'm sure there are lots of people (including myself) who would love some guides for getting good sounds with bass, drums, ect with VSTs alone.

VHello, everyone. I play guitar and vocals in a technical death metal band called Cruelty Exalted. We are based out of Los Angeles and are currently in the process of recording a 3 song EP. We've recorded the guitar tracks for about 2 songs and drum tracks for 1 so far, but we still have a lot of work that has yet to be completed and we've been having trouble finding musicians that can commit to completely finishing this EP. I'm currently working with a drummer, but he's been experiencing a lot of technical issues and hasn't been able to spend much time on this project due to his job. Furthermore, the bass players that I know personally have been extremely busy with their own bands or haven't shown much commitment in participating. In other words, I'm technically the only permanent member save for my friend whom I'm recording guitar and vocal tracks with (although he's not really a member of the band per se).\u000aPotential bass players must be able to have all the typical death metal chops such as speed, accuracy, the ability to sweep and tremolo pick, etc. The ability to write creative bass lines is also a strong plus. While not necessarily required, finger-style is strongly preferred over pick-playing.\u000aSimilarly, potential drummers must be able to have all of the typical death metal chops such as being able to play blastbeats, use double bass pedals, create unique and interesting beats and fills, be able to play at very high speeds (at or around 250 BPM is a solid estimate, just for the sake of argument), and pretty much everything else you'd expect of a death metal drummer with regards to technique and creativity.\u000aThis applies to both instruments: It is also imperative that recording equipment is readily available to you, either by borrowing it through a friend, owning it yourself, going to a studio, or any other legal method of accessing such materials. Owning Guitar Pro, Power Tab, Tux Guitar, or any other variation of such a program is strongly advised. We will definitely be exchanging a lot of files, so be sure to check your e-mail, Facebook, Reddit, etc. often in case we're in an exceptionally busy stage in the recording process. In those instances, prompt responses to messages are absolutely necessary. I can't afford to not hear from you for months at a time if you decide to be a part of this band from the get-go (a musician I used to work with wouldn't respond to his messages for weeks or months at a time, so that's why I'm particularly stringent about slow responses. Obviously I won't be upset if you don't get back to me for a day or a two as long as you explain that you were busy with something else, but it isn't fair to me or the others if you're slow to respond or give results for excessively long periods of time).\u000aLet me know if you'd be interested in being a part of this project either by commenting on this post or sending me a private message. Please include a video or audio clip of your drum or bass playing and I'll get back to you as soon as I can once I've found a proper candidate for the job. Serious inquiries only, please. I'd like think that I'm easy to work with overall, but I'm looking for the very best musicians I can possibly find, so a professional attitude and work ethic are imperative for this project. Here are some pre-production tracks to give everyone the gist of our style:\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/alec-cordero/dethroning-the-righteous-rough\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/alec-cordero/dethroning-mix-1\u000ahttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8796958/Caelum%20fixed%20snare.mp3\u000aLooking forward to seeing your submissions!

sV[Discussion] I released several videos going over the concept of riffs and my approach to writing them
p201
VSome background for my Youtube channel:\u000a\u000aThere are a ton of resources out there for beginner musicians trying to learn how to play, but the majority of these channels I feel stick to the basics in order to reach the widest audience. It ends up being not very informative especially for guitar videos when it's some guy showing you how to play a song by calling out each fret+string. I imagine the same frustrating thing must exist for drummers and bass players as well.\u000a\u000aThere are less channels out there that are willing to talk about songwriting and musicianship from a conceptual standpoint and even fewer of those channels are dedicated to metal. I want to try and drive more discussion, which is why I'm releasing a series of videos where I present my personal approach to writing music with an ultimate goal of expanding these discussions by getting more people to do the same. Or at least we can talk about it here.\u000a\u000aAt lot of my earlier videos are fluff and not very organized, but my 3 most recent are concerned with riffs, both as a conceptual thing as well as a look into my own thought process when it comes to writing riffs.\u000a\u000a[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQIDzxiRvPI)\u000a\u000aI try to describe the process when taking a chord progression and turning it into an actual riff. I've highlighted the rhythmic and harmonic aspects of a riff although I feel like I might be missing something else. \u000a\u000aI follow that with a couple of methods I use to write riffs. Now these are more specific to black metal, which is my background, but the concept should still apply to other areas.\u000a\u000aThe first method is playing a simple melody over different parts of a chord progression (Nightmare). The next is creating pattern and consistently applying that pattern over the course of the riff (Shadow). Finally, I end with possibly the simplest method for writing a riff, that is holding a pedal point across your chord progression over a strumming pattern (Autre Temps), a technique you'll find a lot in Alcest, who ends up being used in a ton of my videos because of this.\u000a\u000a[Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rpOryJ4wYI)\u000a\u000aThe idea here is much more abstract, and this video is less of a discussion and more a "Behind the Scenes" for anyone who might actually be a fan of my music. There's also some background info on my channel to clarify points for anyone going through a video-by-video progression.\u000a\u000aThe main point is to identify the habits that you use across your music and rather than allowing it to take over and "Nickelbacking" the same songs over and over again, use it to create an indentity. I talk about my influences and plug a couple of my favorite bands if you guys are loooking for black metal recommendations. Nothing really important to see here.\u000a\u000a[Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1NS6p984cg&amp;feature=youtu.be)\u000a\u000aThis final video is a quick example of a concept that I use throughout my music, which is to take a riff and develop it into secondary riffs, as opposed to writing independent riffs and putting them together into a song.\u000a\u000aThe idea here is that you extract as many details as you can from within a riff for more efficient songwriting that's also more cohesive rather than sticking different ideas together and making them work. In addition to holding a part together, it can create bigger transitions when you move to a section that is written from an independent riff. The example is again from my original, Shadow which I partially broke down in the first video.\u000a\u000aSo whatever you think, give me your ideas. What I want to see is more people opening up their thought process and presenting their songwriting perspective. If something doesn't make sense, I can try my best to clarify. If something's wrong, feel free to correct. If you have something to add, definitely let me know. We're here to talk music.

VI play with a sci-fi themed heavy metal band (clean vocals).  I have always been the primary, but not the only, songwriter for the band.  \u000a\u000aI'm curious if anyone out there has some ideas for chord shapes, counterpoints, chord progressions, and/or two part harmony ideas to give a song a distinctive sci-fi sound.  I'm talking stuff that sounds like 50's and 60's sci-fi movie soundtrack.\u000a\u000aI'm looking for songwriting elements that I can use in upcoming songs, not trying to squeeze it all into one song.  Thanks in advance.

sVMetal Songwriting
p211
Vso I have been playing guitar for almost 20 years. Long story short without going into extreme detail - despite my ability (Advanced), music theory education (intermediate to advanced) and many many years of trying songwriting is by far my biggest pitfall. \u000a\u000aI just feel like I'm a joke when it comes to making my own music and I have tried a number of different ways to get myself inspired, etc.\u000a\u000aI'd love to hear any input you guys all have on your song writing techniques, habits, tips , tricks. ANYTHING!\u000a\u000aAlso, with all that in mind, has anyone tried this course? I have been considering buying it and if anyone has any experience with this course please chime in!\u000a\u000ahttps://www.creativelive.com/courses/mastering-metal-songwriting-eyal-levi\u000a\u000a

sVSo where would I start learning how to write metal?
p213
VI've been dying to write and record my own music for a long time, and now that I'm actually sitting down and trying to come up with stuff, I'm realizing I'm fucking *awful* at writing metal of any sort. I mean, I tried writing simple djent and deathcore songs just to sort of get the bare bones of making riffs and melodies, and I couldn't even do that. I'm trying to write an atmospheric black metal album that's pretty melody driven. What I'm doing is fairly unique, I guess, but the closest thing I could compare it to is Lustre. I just can't come up with a single damn melody no matter how hard I try. What's even more frustrating is that I always get little melodies in my head that I like, but I never can get them figured out on guitar or piano, and I always end up losing them. I was hoping you guys would have some pointers, because I have absolutely no idea what to do or where to start.

sVNeed advice on rehearsal equipment for a technical death metal band
p216
VHey guys,\u000a\u000aThis is my first time getting into a technical death metal band -- lots of blast beats, double bass -- where the guitars (2 of them) are constantly in danger of getting drowned out and muddled. The other guitarist and I are both clueless about what amps/effects/PA to buy to get a reasonable live/rehearsal sound that is also practical during recording time.\u000a\u000aAs I understand I have two options to make noise:\u000a\u000a* 1) Some kind of half-stack set up (Peavey, EVH, etc)\u000a* 2) digital effects/amp simulation feeding into a PA\u000a\u000aIt seems like quite a few bands go for option 2) and go direct to PA. I am not a tube connoseur as I don't know the difference honestly, so 2) seems like a cheaper and way more convenient option.  We want to try to spend probably at most $1500-$3000. It seems like option 1) would be really expensive. Anyone have suggestions, recommendations, advice on how to think about this and proceed? Much appreciated.

VBrothers and Sisters in Thunder! \u000a\u000aLet's talk about your rumble delivery system. What is in it? What do you want to add or delete? What do you love about it and what do you hate? \u000a\u000aI'll start. I play a 6 string Warwick Thumb bass with a bolt on neck. From there, I go through a bass big muff, eq, chorus, delay, (all Boss) and finally a tube preamp. After the effects chain, I go into an SWR Workingman 15" combo. \u000a\u000aThis rig works for the size of shows that I play. The distortion sounds great: it's dirty but retains definition, deep, and blends well with the guitar tone. The tube preamp rounds out my tone and adds some growl. The amp is a solid state, and all I do is boost the bass a little bit, it's otherwise pretty good. \u000a\u000aAt times the amp can be a little to bright, and I never use the horn. Also, when I turn on my chorus pedal I get really loud, I'm not sure if this is due to the amp or the effects. So much so that I have to turn down so I don't drown out the guitar. I think I'm gong to add a compressor, and I hope that solves my volume problem.

p254
VVery excited for the show, but I'm trying to figure out the best way to do everything live. I normally play on my POD HD Pro, although I also have a Peavey XXX Head + Cab.\u000a\u000aPeople have recommended to me to just connect the pod directly to Front of House with an XLR cable, but I think it might be weird playing a show without an amp/cab. I could connect the POD to my effect loop's return on the Peavey (removing the cab sim from my POD patch) and then Mic the cab.\u000a\u000aI was also thinking about making a two channel POD patch, one with the cab sim and one without. Connect the channel without the sim to my amp's effects return and then connect the channel with the cab sim to FoH. That way I can monitor with my cab and I have a real amp on stage, but my sound going to the venue is really good too.\u000a\u000aIs this a good idea?

p266
VHello Reddit, my name is Jeff Seabolt, and I am a 16 year old metal musician whose biggest dream is to just get my music out there and gain a following. No, this is not going to be JUST a self promotion post. First, let me tell you a little about my self.I started playing guitar at a very young age because of my dad inspiring me to.The very first song I ever learned was, of course, smoke on the water by deep purple. I was so proud of myself, until one day, my dad told me about a band called "Metallica" which is what started me being really serious on guitar. I played Metallica covers for years until I turned 13, which is when I decided to come up with my own stuff, and also screw around with music production software (at the time, audacity lol). Anywho, ever since then, ive been improving and improving and finally, I would say I am at a professional level.My equipment so far is: Guitars: BC Rich Warlock, Dean ZX, Fender American Telecaster Interface: Line 6 UX1 Computer: HP 2000 (getting a new one soon) Software: Reaper DAW, POD Farm 2.5 platinum (for guitar and bass), and for drums, Kontakt 5 with Steven Slate, and also Superior Drummer.\u000a\u000aIf you would like to listen to my music, go here:\u000a\u000ahttp://soundcloud.com/jeff-seabolt/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/user/WeeklyAudio(mainlyolder stuff)\u000a\u000aAlso, check out my most recent single which is on Itunes, Spotify, and more called "Plutonium".\u000a\u000ahttp://soundcloud.com/jeff-seabolt/plutonium

We have a few more shows coming up in October, just ordered a ton of shirts and posters, however we recently just parted ways with our bassist and it's been difficult finding someone with talent and passion in our area. I figured i'd make a calling in this subreddit to see if this post catches anyones attention. Check us out [here](https://everyn.bandcamp.com/), and let me know if you'd be a good fit or if you know someone who would be! We appreciate it.\u000a\u000aPS: We play in Dropped B, with an additional low E (7th string)

sVGood EQ bandwidth areas for specific instruments (Prog Metal/Power Metal/Symphony elements too..?)
p271
VI'm wanting to really buckle down and finally start recording some stuff after some years of not really touching my equipment (busy work life and personal life for awhile now).\u000a\u000aI've never really taken note of specific ways I would EQ my mixes in the past so I'm trying to go into this again with a clean slate before I take any bad habits with me into mixing/recording.  \u000a\u000aI'll be playing through an Eleven Rack for Guitar and Bass, using a DM10 Alesis drum kit with Addictive Drums sounds, and some Omnisphere and Eastwest Quantum Leap VSTs on midi controller/keys for some symphonic elements.\u000a\u000aI read up a few days ago on an old thread by [Ensi](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalmusicians/comments/u05ae/ensis_very_basic_guide_to_metal_recording_and/) which seems like its going to be extremely helpful (as I used to always do the cheap/lazy way of double tracking guitars with a hard pan left/hard pan right copy/paste off set..and as he shows its a shit method compared to actually double tracking).  \u000a\u000aDoes anyone know some generally successful EQ # ranges/bandwidths to keep within with specific instruments and general areas to pan them to in the mix before I really get neck deep into it today?  \u000a\u000aFor example on drums, is it common to keep the snare off-center or dead center?  Toms and cymbals I'm sure are something you just kind of play with in the mix though so I'll goof off with them.\u000a\u000aI've never recorded any midi elements yet in any mix I've done.  I'm wondering about what EQ range to keep them in as well.  Should I keep them very mid-heavy with the guitars or will it muddy up the mix?  Should they pan out hard left and right as well to envelope the drums and bass?  \u000a\u000aAny tips or tried and true methods from anyone would be appreciated!

I play bass and a little bit of guitar, so I really haven't a clue regarding percussion equipment or anything technical. I don't think he has any interest in taking lessons, but seems pretty motivated to at least be able to jam a little bit for fun. He's into thrash/hardcore/black. He's ok with buying used and has a budget around $500USD. Is there any advice to be offered regarding brands? Are there opinions on procurement? For instance, should he focus on getting a kit or piece together higher-quality components? Any thoughts on specific components? Should he plunge right into double bass or hold-off?

Open to using either and open to different tunings. \u000a\u000aAs far as my playing, I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit rusty. Between a full time job and school, my playtime is kind of limited, and a lot of times when I sit down to play, I get kind of discouraged on my current writing and just end up doing something else. I'm a very good rhythm player, and have never been that great at leads, although I can make some and learn some if it's demanded of me.\u000a\u000aReally I want to do this as a way to get me back into playing more and writing some fresh stuff. I was in a signed band and toured for a while, but all that ended way back in 2006. I haven't jammed with people in well over a year, and it sucks. I haven't been that inspired with stuff and playing with other people will stir up my creative process. If you want to do all the guitars that's cool with me, and I can make just drum tracks. If you want to split guitars and make drums yourself, or have me make them, I'm cool with that too. Pretty much what I'm saying is I'm down for whatever. Just wanna make some music for the sake of making music. Open to all types of metal, and we can take it any direction. I just want to be doing something.\u000a\u000aIf you want to hear some stuff I've made and are interested, shoot me a PM and I can send you some tracks via email or something. I have some full songs, and a fuck ton of little snippets of stuff. I'm not that great at the whole mixing and mastering thing, but my stuff doesn't sound like complete shit either. if we actually start taking this somewhere, I'm down to actually have someone do a good job on the recording and know people who could make it happen.

I'm worried however, as I play in a blackenedish doomish death metal band, where my punchy sound is important, that I'll lose it with a fretless.  every fretless bassist I hear in death metal has a very clean tone, as oppose to my heavily driven one.

If anyone has any info or resources that a beginner can reference for recording metal guitar I would be very thankful.

sVDo you think what constitutes "metal" is open to interpretation?
p316
VRecently got into a debate in /r/guitar because I mentioned I didn't consider Iron Maiden metal anymore. It seems to me that since genres are solely determined by people who write articles and edit Wikipedia, it should be totally acceptable for people to have their own interpretations of what does and doesn't fall within a certain genre. In light of the growth of death metal, hardcore, and related subgenres in the past 30 years I now call modern metal simply "metal" and Metallica, Maiden, and derivative modern bands (Avenged Sevenfold, Arch Enemy etc.) "heavy metal." This is mostly because I'm much more into the former style and don't want to have to refer to whatever inane sub-genre of metal all the time in conversation. I was catching a lot of flak for this at r/guitar, they think genre lines are set in stone and not open to interpretation, so I was wondering what a more metal crowd thinks.

We're looking to learn and improve, so give us your harshest criticism on any of that, except the lyrics.  We're perfectly aware of how bad those are, and we're working on it.
p327
sVWhat's your inspiration?
p328
VI know we all love making music, and metal. And for a genre this cut throat, heavy and passionate, there's usually some powerful inspiration that motivates us to make this music. It may not necessarily be serious, like maybe your inspiration is to tell the story of how humanity will one day be overthrown by radioactive hermit crabs? But it's something, and if you're passionate about it, you make great music about it. \u000a\u000aI believe everyone here is talented and have the potential to make some wonderful music. So I was wondering what everybody's inspiration stemmed from that makes them want to create.

sVMetal Pickup Recommendations?
p359
VMetal guitarists! What pickups should I get? The EMGs in my Jackson King V have both failed, so I'm in the market. I'd prefer passive pickups this time around, and preferably not at a great cost since the guitar is one of those Japanese-made ones, so I don't think the pickups should be worth more than what I paid.\u000a\u000aI figured I'd ask you all since I never really had to put much thought into pickups. I've been happy with what my other guitars have come with (SD Invaders, SD SH4s, DiMarzio Super Distortions...), but now there's a decision to be made!\u000a\u000aMy styles range across the board from Iced Earth-y to Primal Fear-y to Opeth-y to Morbid Angel-y depending on the band I'm working on ([Burning Shadows](http://burningshadows.com) or [Recently Vacated Graves](http://zombiemetal.com) or one of my unending extra projects).

sVWhat's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]
p368
VRight now, my 2nd guitar is a Dean Vendetta XM, which I mainly use for playing leads, solos, and songs in E and D# standard.\u000a\u000aWhile its nice for a sub-$100 guitar, the tone is still pretty lacking, and the construction is not the best. So rather than sticking to entry level guitars, I feel like I'm good enough at this point to have a pro-level guitar. \u000a\u000aOn that note, what guitar would you recommend for playing mainly leads and solos? Preferably, the guitar should have a clean, high, trebly sound, and the price should be &gt;= $400.

sVNon-Local Collaboration - Native American/Indigenous Themed
p382
VI posted on here before about a collaboration.. Thinking that bring my own tunes I\u2019ve been playing for years ISN\u2019T the best way to push this along, it\u2019s really hard to get people on the same page as you. BUT, alas, I have another idea. I\u2019ve been wanting to do something technical for awhile as a challenge. Thinking like Sepultura/Nile but Native American/Indigenous Themed. Technical with tribal drumming, progressive clean parts, my fianc is Native and we listen to Native Flute on Pandora a lot, maybe some influences from there. Would love to include Aztek/Mayan/Individual tribes/events as topics of songs.\u000a\u000aBut this seems like a much more plausible non-local collaboration. I havn\u2019t even written a riff for this yet haha, I would do guitar, maybe vocals. I\u2019ve been using Reaper and Amplitube.. Amplitube sounts super scratchy idk if maybe my guitar needs a better pickup not sure.

We have a handful of songs written, 1 fully recorded (fake drums) along with a shit-ton of riffs and testosterone because we haven't played a show in a while. It's all DIY at this point, but we are looking for someone who is interested in touring and pushing the envelope as far as it will go.\u000a\u000aIf you would like to have a listen, our recording can be heard here: https://soundcloud.com/antons-key-band/battousai-the-wanderer\u000a\u000aIf you would like to know more about our influences, schedules, ideas, favorite beers, feel free to drop a note or PM the bands account, I'll check it regularly.

sVMy bands' drummer's kit was destroyed...
p403
V..and he still wants to use it.... -_- some backstory is somebody got really mad at him and spray painted the shit out of his kit and then smashed it with a bowling ball after he left it dumped in a pile on his drive way after having some personal problems and hitting a low patch with his SO (which is another problem in it of itself, they constantly fight while we try to practice together, and she has attacked his kit on numerous occasions) and he salvaged some of it and said he wants to record a demo with this kit.... I was absolutely horrified (im the guitarist if that matters) and told him he at least needs to get a new 16' china, a 18' crash, a 10' and a 12' tom, and new bass drum because all he has right now is a snare, a trashed bass drum, an old ride, and his old hi hats. He did buy some new double bass trigger pedals but what good are they doing with that mess of a bass drum it doesn't even have a front head... (We are a metal band by the way) But anyways he keeps saying his kit is fine and even wants to use it for gigs... Yeah that's right, HE WANTS TO PLAY GIGS WITH HIS BOWLING BALL SMASHED DRUM KIT!! And also he wants to record drum tracks with it even though I have the means to program the drums with him perfectly fine he absolutely refuses. My question is have I done all I can with him? Is this a lost cause with him because he's a very good friend of mine but he's being ridiculous and I'm very serious about music. Do you guys have any advice for me to help him get back on track and thinking straight?\u000a\u000aTL;DR: My friend who's the drummer in my band's kit got vandalized and he wants to use his beyond bare bones destroyed kit for shows and recording, how can I help him see the light that it's beyond saving?

When I first started a month ago my throat was completely clogged but recently I noticed that there is less and less each time I sing, Do I learn to incorporate it into my singing or does it go away with time? So far its just annoying because I don't think it gives me the sound I want and when I try to sing clean the mucus ruins everything. Sorry for the long post, any help appreciated! \u005cm/

VOk not bashing anybody but holy shit this subreddit really needs to crack down on the music submission stuff, kind of like WATMM did. \u000a\u000aThere is little discussion being had because it's mainly just videos of people going off in their bedrooms :(\u000a\u000aI'd personally like to see more Theory, Composition, Technique etc. discussion. Nothing wrong with Bedroom Guitarists, just need more discussion in my humble opinion.\u000a\u000aThanks for listening and reading!\u000a\u000aEDIT: You know, I am sorry for the title. It sounds rude and very critical. That was definitely NOT my intention at all. I'm sorry.

sV[x-post-ish from /r/metal] I've been directed here for a thing I'd like to do
p427
VSo I made [a little video game](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/242049-Windows-Mac-Linux-Jane-Blaine-and-her-Thunder-Mane-in-Mosher-s-Delight) about a metalhead who headbangs her lightning hair at her foes to defeat them using the power of six metal subgenres.\u000a\u000a\u000aSo far, though, what I've got in the way of music is mediocre synth loops a few seconds long composed in LMMS by yours truly ([here they are back to back](https://soundcloud.com/xyy-zz/moshers-delight-the-few-loops)), and I was wondering if any of you guys and gals could help me with that.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe challenge would be to write and perform six loopable songs, one for each subgenre. The subgenres featured are classical, thrash, power, black, doom and death, in order of appearance. In the actual game, they're all played at the same time and faded in and out as weapons are switched, so it would be important for them to have the exact same tempo, length, and maybe general chord progression. The loops I've got are at 152 BPM, but very little of the game's stuff makes use of it and I set it up it so I can change it easily.\u000a\u000a\u000aSo uh, that's about it. Thanks for making it to here and keep on rocking.\u000a\u000a**edit:** Holy crap, you guys, thank you so much. No less than six people stepped forward so far -- I'm actually in a bit of a pinch because I feel like crap asking people to make music left and right only to drop it for somebody else, but I also feel like crap turning people away.

The feedback we have been receiving from the metal community has been tremendously positive and enthusiastic and we have been working our asses off to create something that is not only cool but also feature packed and functional. At this point, I am excited to say we are ready for bands to beta test our website and app. If you are in a metal band and willing to help out, please send an email to: Beta@ore.fm and include the following information:\u000a\u000a* Your bands location/home town\u000a* How many band members you have\u000a* Are you using Iphone or Android devices \u000a\u000aYou will be required to fill out a questionnaire after testing to report any bugs or issues you have come across and of course, we have some goodies set aside for our testers. More information will be provided about the testing via email.  If you have any questions about ORE FM, feel free to post and we will do our best to answer. \u000a\u000aThank you all!

sVAny Help Deciding an Orchestral VST?
p452
V\u000aNot purely related to metal, but those involved in more symphonic metal could perhaps help. So after some deliberation, i think i'm ready to add an orchestral program to my arsenal of shit i do not need. In an ideal situation, i would like to be able to make tracks would replicate the style and quality of Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia and Death Cvlt Armageddon from Dimmu Borgir (~[an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQSFpKG1les)). What i don't want is a program that emulates noticeably synthy/artificial tone, as my keyboard can already do that. Having done a little research, I've narrowed down my options to the following based on a budget of around $500, with pros and cons that i hope someone could give their own two cents.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a**Native Instruments - Komplete**\u000a\u000aI've been eyeing Komplete for a while since i've been using Rig Kontrol as my DI for guitar/bass and Guitar Rig demo for practice. I wanted to get Komplete as opposed to the standalone Kontakt (the orchestral sampler) since it not only includes what i need, but also has the full version of Guitar Rig, as well as a shit load of non metal/rock/orchestral toys i can play with. Here's the run down:\u000a\u000a*Pros*\u000a\u000a* Includes Kontakt, well know sampler program that works well and supports 3rd party\u000a* Includes Guitar Rig, which would be a step up from trying to work around the 40 min demo version\u000a* Additional programs to mess around with\u000a* Reliable company name\u000a\u000a*Cons*\u000a\u000a* Costs $499, near top of my budget\u000a* May or may not have any real use for other programs besides Kontakt and Rig, so may not be worth the money\u000a* Vanilla sample library given not the best sounding, and may require buying third party libraries like Albion, ergo needing to spend more $$$, ergo probably be the **most expensive pathway** \u000a\u000a**EastWest Quantum Leap Orchestra + Choir**\u000a\u000aEastWest really grabbed my attention, as all examples of their products sounded amazing and what i'm looking for. For my budget, im aiming at getting EWQL Orchestra(gold), though had I the money and faith in their products, the Composer's Collection would have been the best option. Right now though, if i order within the next 24 hours through Sweetwater, i have the option of adding their Choirs program, which sounds totally badass. However, there are some issues that make me hesitate to pull to trigger on their products\u000a\u000a*Pros*\u000a\u000a* Best sounding out of the box, what i'm looking for\u000a* Some reviews swear by how good the program is for professional line of work\u000a* Symphonic Choirs sounds amazing, word generator adds some realism as opposed to simple Ooh's and Ahh's\u000a\u000a*Cons*\u000a\u000a* Terrible reviews on reliability and Customer Support. This is the red flag that scares me. I see reviews from people who buy EWQL products (including their Composer collection, retailing around $1000) that will straight up not work. These either stem form data corruption, compatibility issues primarily with Mac's (I'm on win 7, so i may dodge that bullet), or issues with iLok (explained below).\u000a* Uses native PLAY engine sampler. From what i understand, PLAY is very resource dependent, and may still cause issues on more powerful rigs (I'm running an Intel i7 with 12 Gb of ram, so hopefully this would be enough). Kontakt appears to be the better engine from what i hear\u000a* Uses an iLok system. You literally have to spend an extra $50 on a "special" usb drive that holds your activation serial code, which needs to be plugged in order for any of their products to run. iLok not working? You're shit out of luck.\u000a\u000a**Vienna Symphonic Library Special Edition**\u000a\u000aVSL seems to be the middle ground between Komplete and EWQL. I haven't done as much research into them as Native Instruments or EastWest, however from what i gather they seem to be a viable third option.\u000a\u000a*Pros*\u000a\u000a* Samples sound realistic, comparable to EWQL\u000a* Reputable company and product\u000a* Possibly the cheapest option\u000a\u000a*Cons*\u000a\u000a* Dry samples that require a lot of processing to sound natural\u000a* Sampler engine very technical, requires time to understand full potential\u000a* Also uses a USB key system :(\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHopefully you've read through my great wall of text and understand the mindset i have right now on these three products. In general, if you have any information or experience with these products at all, whether it be positive or negative, please leave some feedback. However, here are some main points that i would really like addressed in order to make a sound decision\u000a\u000a* Are the given libraries for Komplete's Kontakt at least comparable to the other programs, or will i need to dish out some more money?\u000a* Is EastWest reliable, or are they shit? Preferably any recent interactions with the company, as they may have improved over the years.\u000a* How resource dependent is each engine on my PC specs (Win 7, Intel i7, 12gb ram, possibly using external hard drive) solely for composition, not live playing?\u000a* Any success in using these programs in a metal/rock track? Samples?\u000a

sVUK based Artists looking for online collaborators to create music for ongoing art project
p464
Vbeen on the hunt for a while and now posting this to every music sub i can to get as many people involved as possible. already got 4 guys on board but need more people involved with a focus on specific talents. guitar, drums, bass, vocals. none will be turned away we need as many of you as possible!\u000a\u000ajust a quick breakdown of who we are and what the actual concept is. my partner an i are not musicians, we are performance and installation artists based in London, England. we are currently creating a multi-faceted piece of work that involves, sculpture, installation, merch, sound, and performance. what we are essentially trying to do is create a cult status around a central symbol. that is our horseman. the name of the project is Arrasa Con Todo, roughly translated means Destroy Everything. the music produced by yourselves will not be for sale at any point but will be used during shows to set ambience and tone. the reason we want a group of people working separately on one project is to see how each individual responds to a brief uniquely. we will provide basic info such as tempo and key, the rest is up to the individual. we will then arrange the individual stems into as many unique tracks as possible and once done roughly, we will submit back to the artists for review and criticism.\u000a\u000alike we said we dont want this to take up a large amount of anyones time, just dirty lo-fi aggression.\u000a\u000athis is part of a large project that has no financial support, we are working from the ground up and hence why we need to rely on like minded people who are enthusiastic about the project and dont mind giving up bit of time to add to something new. you will be credited for your work but it will not be specified what you did exactly, just that you were a collaborator.\u000a\u000awe are looking for each track to be a journey from drone/stoner sound scape through to aggressive breakdown and chorus. really unpolished raw and distorted. its got to feel 'real'. The daw we are using is logic 9 pro so please try to provide the stems as raw files if possible avoiding compression, bouncing etc.\u000a\u000abasically what we want is loads of different stems, guitar riffs, drum beats, bass lines, vocal stabs/lines as possible and to make them into something new.\u000a\u000aPM me if your interested with a link to some of your work and your email address and i will send you over the images we have created and a brief.\u000a\u000a

It never seems to fit when I try it. \u000a\u000aI don't have a kit, so I just try to put it in guitar pro and I hope it works. Any resources or input will be a huge help.

sVtips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)
p533
VHey guys, how's it going?\u000a\u000aSo I've been practicing vocals for quite some time, mostly singing along in the car to loud music, and whatnot. Recently I joined a band and while my screaming sounds pretty good on amp, it doesn't sound that great when I record it (through a voicelive play). \u000a\u000aI'm curious how to improve my voice, as there aren't very many good tips and tricks online for more heavy death metal. Dying Fetus, Pig destroyer, Arch Enemy and Chthonic are some huge influences on the sound I'm going for.\u000a\u000aAlternatively, does anyone else have problems getting their recordings not sounding like PA? Am I just not great, and masking my voice through a shitty mic? \u000a\u000aI definitely want to get better.\u000a\u000aThanks in advance!

I like designing things for my own project a lot, so I figured I'd get some practice by coming up with some stuff for other people. I'm not awesome, but I enjoy it and can definitely come up with some usable stuff.~~\u000a\u000a~~I'll do logos for like the first 5 or so people who post here, and maybe get around to doing the rest of them at a later date? (College student with limited time!) Can be a solo project, band, whatever.~~ \u000a\u000a~~Just post your band name, and style/a link to some of your tunes and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Ideally I could do 5 of these in like two to three weeks. These are free, obviously.~~\u000a\u000aGotten six requests, gonna stop taking them while I do these.

sVPeavey shoot-out: 6505+ or JSX?
p543
VI'm sure such a question come up all the time but:  \u000a\u000aI'm on a pretty damn tight budget for a head, I was looking at the bugera 333xl or 6262, but I've found the heads they copy for about the same price (used of course) but I really cannot tell which is more for me.  \u000a\u000aI play progressive death metal, so I'd need something that can do a few different sounds (clean atmoshperic stuff, steve vai kinda leads) which the JSX provides but also I need that really intense brutality of the 6505.   \u000a\u000aHave any of you tried both, what were your thoughts? is the 6505+ more versatile than I think, or can the JSX do more brutal stuff than I've heard?

sVAre lyrics welcomed here? Here is an entire albums worth.
p573
VSo I am working on an album, this is the first undertaking of this scale that I have done. The genre is Grind/Doom metal and the album is WW1 themed. This is the order in which I wrote them, some songs are just over 2 min and some will be longer. There is a supernatural aspect that I want to expand on with more albums. I posted a demo version of the first song a while ago but I didn't have the rest of it written yet. So without farther delay, I present The Forlorn Odyssey.\u000aP.S. the formatting is all fucky.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Into the Grinder]\u000a\u000aOver the trench,\u000ainto the gas.\u000aBodies lie exposed,\u000arotting and bloated.\u000a\u000aMiles of wasteland,\u000atwisted hunks of metal.\u000aDead eye stares pierce the night,\u000aA bullet to the head ends your fight.\u000a\u000aInto the grinder,\u000aInto the grinder.\u000a\u000a[For the Cattle]\u000a\u000aThey say only the dead know the end of war,\u000abut in this eternal battle the dead still wage on.\u000a\u000aArisen from the mud,\u000awashed in the blood of the dead.\u000a\u000aTime to rejoin the fight,\u000atime is neither day or night.\u000aIn this hell you cannot end,\u000adoomed to die and die again.\u000a\u000aTrapped on this eternal field of battle,\u000aflesh and bones, food for the cattle.\u000a\u000a\u000a[No One but the Dead]\u000a\u000aWelcome to the front lines,\u000ayou bed is made from corpses.\u000aYou sleep with the rats,\u000athe stench of death suffocates.\u000a\u000aDrowned in the mud,\u000aa bullet to the head.\u000aKeep your wits about you,\u000aor you'll wind up dead.\u000a\u000aInto the bog, filled with bodies and blood,\u000adown into hell, if you make a wrong step.\u000ashelled from above,\u000agrinded from afar.\u000aYou're a statistic in the news,\u000aa casualty of war.\u000a\u000aGaze upon the field,\u000afilled with our remains.\u000aOverran in minutes,\u000athere's no one but the dead.\u000a\u000a\u000a[The Oncoming Storm]\u000a\u000aFlares illuminate the sky,\u000aburning bright as daylight.\u000aHit the dirt,\u000aor catch a bullet.\u000a\u000aThe light fades to darkness,\u000akeep crawling forward.\u000aFear not the stray round,\u000afor when death chooses you\u000ayou will never be found.\u000a\u000aIn the land no man calls home,\u000awhere blood has stained the dirt.\u000aThe mud is filled with fallen brothers,\u000ametal barbs shred your skin.\u000a\u000aWithout warning,\u000athe lead rains down.\u000aThere is no cover,\u000afrom the oncoming storm.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Born of War]\u000a\u000aAs I sit inside my wretched trench,\u000amy hatred for humanity grows unchecked.\u000aThe sleepless nights and gore filled days,\u000ahave withered my spirit into nothing.\u000aWar has worn away my soul,\u000aI hold no hope for mankind's future.\u000a\u000aI am born of war,\u000athe embodiment of misanthropy.\u000aA vessel for the hatred of man,\u000alet death flow from my hands.\u000a\u000aI

immortality,\u000aI will show no mercy to my enemies.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Among the Dead]\u000a\u000aI haunt these barren trenches,\u000aWhere men once told tales of home.\u000aNothing remains but bones and mud,\u000ashattered dreams and hope forgone.\u000aOn this silent field I found myself,\u000aamong the din and horror of war.\u000aAn ethereal wight beyond times reach,\u000aa guardian for the men

sVBest fixed-bridge 6-strings for metal
p593
VI'm curious what are considered some of the best fixed-bridge 6-strings out there good for metal. It seems fixed bridge isn't that common at higher price points, but I'm pretty sick of my floating bridge (Ibanez S2120). The thing won't stay in tune that well and I tend to change between drop and standard tuning frequently, so it is a huge pain. Any suggestions for models to look into?\u000a\u000aedit: Thanks everybody for the suggestions. Will check them all out. Also, had never thought of blocking the bridge, interesting idea.

sVLooking to start a band in the Boston Area
p597
VHi Everyone,\u000a\u000aI'm looking to start a band in the Boston Area.  I've been playing music for 11 years, but I haven't played in a group for far too long. Anywhere in between Boston and Worcester is readily accessible to me. \u000a\u000aMy biggest influences are Machine Head, Megadeth, Despised Icon, Within The Ruins, and, In Flames.\u000a\u000aI'm a guitar player, but I need everything else, including a practice space, because of this, I'm also open to joining up with any group in need of a guitar player if they already have a practice space, whichever is easier.\u000a\u000aI'm looking to see what's out there.  Anyone in the area, let me know if you're also looking, and what your influences are!
p598
sVWe just released our first album and now we're constantly getting messages from reviewers and radio sites wanting to promo our album. That's great and all, but they all want us to send them a free album first. Is this normal? How should we handle this?
p599
VOur album is free to stream on bandcamp, so if someone wants to review it and/or play it, it's completely available to do so. I understand why larger sites would want a physical album, since they're going to get requests from so many shitty little bands that actually sending the physical deal shows at least some level professional dedication. It just seems weird that if the site is already interested, that they'd want/demand a free physical copy before they review it. It costs an annoying amount of money to send out albums, especially internationally, and I can't help to feel that these people are just wanting free stuff. Any other bands get in this situation after a release, and any advice?\u000a\u000aWe're [Tanagra](http://tanagraband.bandcamp.com/), for the curious.

sVWriting 2 guitar parts that go well together?
p603
VHey guys. So I'm a big fan of djent/progressive death metal/deathcore, and also a beginner musician with ambitions of someday starting my own musical project. \u000a\u000aIn the music I listen to, often there will be 2 guitar parts: one playing a heavier riff on the lowest two or three strings, and another playing a more melodic part over it on the higher strings. It sounds amazing when done well. I've tried to write similar 2-guitar songs, but I'm obviously doing something wrong, because something about it sounds... off. Like the guitars are competing rather than working together.\u000a\u000aI've been trying to find info on this problem through Google, but I haven't turned up much. Most of what I've found has been on guitar harmonies; my impression is that guitar harmonies have the exact same rhythm on both guitars and only the note pitch varies. While no doubt useful, it doesn't teach me everything I want to know. I know I've heard 2-part songs where the guitars' rhythm was not exactly the same. Conventional wisdom dictates that the rhythm guitar plays chords while the lead guitar plays a melody, but I honestly can't think of a single band I like that has their rhythm guitar playing mostly chords. I guess it's different in metal (or at least the kinds of metal I listen to).\u000a\u000aTL;DR: How do I write 2 guitar parts that sound good together? What rhythmic and melodic principles do I need to keep in mind?

VI go to RPI and live in troy during the school year. My jamming partner graduated and I was looking for some new people to play with.

sVDespite following numerous video tutorials I still have a very flat guitar sound. What are they doing right that I'm not?
p646
VSo recently I've been trying to get more serious about recording my music. I don't have a lot of experience, but I've been trying to soak up everything I can about recording heavy music. More specifically- guitars.\u000a\u000aI've been going all over youtube looking for tutorials and tips for mixing/mastering/recording. I have a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFP0-yGH-rWdYfE83fvJQRDnUTxr49oRR) here of all the videos I try to reference.\u000a\u000aDespite following all the steps and using the same plugins my recording always sounds inferior. I can't figure it out for the life of me.\u000a\u000aHere are two recordings I just did-\u000a\u000a* [Guitar Test](https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/hibria-guitar-test)\u000a* [Full track test](https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/hibria-master)\u000a\u000aThe guitar test is just one of my two guitar tracks center panned. The full track test has two tracks panned left and right with rough bass and drums. Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/dmJLqZc.jpg) showing the VSTs I used and their settings.\u000a\u000a* TSE808\u000a* TSE X50\u000a* Poulin LeCab2 with Catharsis impulses\u000a* EQ with high pass and low pass\u000a\u000aMy I use an [Audiobox interface](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/AudioBoxUSB), [Ibanez RG2EX1](http://ibanez.wikia.com/wiki/RG2EX1) (2008-2010 specs), and [JBL SR305](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/LSR305) monitors.\u000a\u000aI've gone through multiple tutorials and their end product always sounds better than mine and I don't know why. Mine just seems so much more flat where theirs is so much fuller and richer. I would love to get some feedback or insight as to what I'm missing despite the fact I don't get the same results from following the same tutorial. I really want to get better at this and start producing my music. Thanks in advance!\u000a\u000aEDIT- just wanted to emphasis that the videos I've followed all use VSTS, cab sims, and plugins. I'm not watching someone use expensive amps, guitars, and mic and wondering why I sound like shit. If you don't want to go through the playlist I have above, here's a good example. This is the first video tutorial I followed- http://youtu.be/L6PHzkPjH7c. It's just some kid, so I doubt he's using expensive gear. I've followed his steps and used his settings, but my sound is always so much flatter.

VHey everyone. I am starting to do vocals and would like some material to practice on.

What are they talking about and how does one write/organize/compose a song.  Something about music theory.\u000a\u000aIt is obviously not recorded well.  I had no bass and used guitar hero drums, which I kinda think is funny.  Recording the solo was a slaughter and doesn't mix in well at all with the other guitars.

p658
VHey metalheads,\u000a\u000aI've been doing metal vocals for a few years, and have learned a lot, as well as nearly perfected my craft.  I still have a lot to learn, and have many ways in which I can grow.  One of the ways I wish to grow is by actually joining a band, instead of simply doing covers to other bands that I like.  I'll be willing to travel a little (I don't want to go out of state just to rehearse and/or hang, but i would be willing to go as far as rogers or maybe bentonville).  I currently am residing in fayetteville, so if you are nearby, definitely let me know here.\u000a\u000afrom what others have told me, from hearing me sing, they say that I sound EXACTLY like Randy Blythe from Lamb of God.  I suppose that is a good thing, but I would like to have my own sound.  Which is why I would like to find a group of guys/girls who play metal, and are in need of a vocalist.  This way I can grow more, and begin to develop my own personal sound.\u000a\u000aThanks for reading, and i'll see you all in hell.

sV[Black Metal] Shadow (3:22), new demo
p660
VEDIT: Improved the mix\u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/brianjleong/shadow-demo-remixed\u000a\u000aFinally got in the recording booth for the first time in over a month. Lyrically, I think the opening lines are killer and it begged me to write an entire song, but I found out pretty quick is really damn hard to write a black metal song about your shadow that isn't complete cheese. Lyrics are subject to change at any time.\u000a\u000aThe riff is an alternating pattern between I and V that's really fun to play. Drums are programmed, and I'm not a drummer, so there's a lot of work needed there.\u000a\u000aThings that need to be worked on: The song is in dire need of leads, but I haven't decided what I want to play over the riff. Might go as far as doing a solo but that kind of also takes away from the minimalistic black metal approach I'm going for. \u000a\u000aAlso, this is the second song I recorded vocals for today (will finish that one later), so I did it all on one take and didn't bother to go back and smooth things out. The edge makes it a bit more genuine I guess, but it doesn't exactly sound they way I want it to.\u000a\u000aAll comments appreciated, especially on production, mixing, etc!

sVLet's Talk Bass, Week IV: Counterpoint
p662
VWelcome back. This week we're going to expand your lick vocabulary with a concept dating back to Bach, and possibly further than that! That concept is counterpoint.\u000a\u000aAn advance warning: There is some heavy theory in this part.\u000a\u000aFirst, a few definitions of counterpoint. The lede of [Wikipedia's article about counterpoint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint) (which I am paraphrasing heavily for the theory of counterpoint) describes it thus:\u000a\u000a&gt;In music, counterpoint is the relationship between voices that are interdependent harmonically (polyphony) and yet are independent in rhythm and contour.\u000a\u000aLater in the article, composer and University of Washington Music prof John Rahn describes it like this:\u000a\u000a&gt;It is hard to write a beautiful song. It is harder to write several individually beautiful songs that, when sung simultaneously, sound as a more beautiful polyphonic whole. The internal structures that create each of the voices separately must contribute to the emergent structure of the polyphony, which in turn must reinforce and comment on the structures of the individual voices. The way that is accomplished in detail is...'counterpoint'.\u000a\u000aIn *my* words, counterpoint is the art of writing two different melodies that complement each other.\u000a\u000a**Species counterpoint**, or **strict counterpoint**, was developed as a tool for teaching student composers, who would go through several "species" of increasing complexity. This was largely codified by a Johann Fux in 1725 with his textbook *Gradus ad Parnassum* (Steps to Parnassus). I won't bore you with all of the rules of species counterpoint that he defined, but some of the most important ones were:\u000a\u000a1. *The counterpoint should begin and end on perfect consonance.* This means the combination of notes should involve only unisons, octaves, perfect fourths, and perfect fifths. A power chord has perfect consonance.\u000a\u000a2. *Contrary motion should predominate.* This means that the two melodic lines should be moving opposite each other most of the time. The other types of motion are parallel (which we covered in Part I as "doubling"), similar (where the lines move in the same direction, but in different intervals, common in Maiden guitar harmonies), and oblique (which we covered in Part I as "pedaling," where one voice moves while the other stays in place)\u000a\u000a3. *Perfect consonances must be approached by oblique or contrary motion.* Since the piece must begin and end with perfect consonance, the piece must have either of these right before the ending.\u000a\u000a4. *Imperfect consonances may be anyhow approached.* This refers to thirds and sixths, both minor and major.\u000a\u000aThere are many others, but these give you the idea.\u000a\u000aSound stifling? In a way, it's intended to be. As I said, Species Counterpoint was intended as a teaching tool, to teach students to understand the harmony of different motion types. Students would "graduate" from this to...\u000a\u000a**Free Counterpoint**, which is not as reliant on those rules. This started development in the Baroque period and has continued developing until the present day, though it was not taught widely until the nineteenth century. There are other types as well, including dissonant counterpoint (where dissonance is the rule rather than consonance) and linear counterpoint (where neither melodic line gives a shit about the other one, resulting in dissonance and consonance willy-nilly).\u000a\u000aSo how does this all relate to bass? Well, put simply, counterpoint is a powerful tool for making a bass-line interesting. Once again, I'm going to demonstrate with a line I wrote. [This](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38920383/Sarrem%20Demo.m4a) is a demo of the line against a guitar/drum scratch track, with the bass super-boosted and slightly chorused. The part during the verse riff (second one) sounds very busy, but it breaks down something like this:\u000a\u000a\u000aA|-7--5-7--5-7--8--7-8--7-8--10--8-10--8-10--12-12-12-12-12-12-12-\u000a\u000aObviously the guitar is not playing this. I'm actually not sure exactly what the guitar is playing in terms of the theory (hence why I paraphrased all that theory jargon from wikipedia). But it doesn't go up like the bass-line does. This creates a counterpoint between the two lines.\u000a\u000aSome places to go to look for counterpoint in bass/metal:\u000a\u000a- Opeth's first two albums have a ton of counterpoint, usually between the guitars. Apparently they had a lot of imitators, which led to the stylistic change for *My Arms Your Hearse*, but I don't know any of the imitators. Opeth still does this in their later material (I was listening to "When" live just now, and the bass does some contrapuntal licks, particularly in the quiet section starting around the 6-minute mark), but not as much.\u000a\u000a- Yes's bassist Chris Squire does counterpoint a lot in writing his bass-lines. Check out songs like Starship Trooper, Close to the Edge, and Roundabout.\u000a\u000a- Iron Maiden's song "The Phantom of the Opera" has a brief counterpoint moment during the instrumental bridge (the bass solo and the guitar parts after are the main counterpoint). Their guitar harmonies occasionally feature similar motion, where the interval between the guitars will switch from a major third to a minor third and back.\u000a\u000aI'm going to leave this part a bit shorter and leave it open for questions. So any questions you have, fire away.\u000a\u000aNext time we'll go into more detail about effects, as I didn't cover them sufficiently for my liking in Part II.

I know the newer models come with 81TW and 89Rs. Older models come with 85s. The pickups only say EMG on them though, so I can't tell which model they are.\u000a\u000aAlso, I noticed on some models the tone knobs and floyd rose are black, and in some they're silver.

If I go higher than normal, things start to clip. If I lower everything, then its kind of muddy and not as precise. I'm messing with EQ's to an extent, but I'm not sure if changing the sound of my guitar entirely is the point of EQing... And I right now the only thing I have going is a VST program that prevents clipping (T-Racks.) Even if I turn that off, something is still missing with my production.\u000a\u000aAnyone have sound loud and clean tips?

sVRPM Challenge black metal project - Wyrgan
p690
VEvening, comrades in metal.\u000a\u000aI was in the [RPM Challenge](http://rpmchallenge.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=844&amp;Itemid=290) this year (which, summed up, is basically to record 35 minutes or 10 songs worth of music only in the month of February) and decided to go in a black metal direction with it. I guess you could say it's progressive black metal, maybe even post-metal. Because I only had a month to do this, some of the ideas are disjointed, I had barely any time to mix, and the lyrics and vocals were done pretty last minute (really). But all in all I really enjoyed the process and almost drove myself nuts writing it.\u000a\u000aI'm talking to some local musicians right now to try and make this a real band, but in the meantime, I'd love some constructive feedback on my writing!\u000a\u000ahttps://wyrgan.bandcamp.com/releases

VI've had a Schecter Damien 8 for a couple years now and even though it's a great guitar to play, I've never been able to record anything I've written on it with good results because no matter how hard I try I can't get it to sound good. Some of my favorite guitarists use EMGs, so I know the answer's not as simple as shitty pickups, but I don't know what to do to get a good tone out of it. Any advice?\u000a\u000aEDIT: The pickups are the stock EMG 808s that came with it and for now I'm running everything through Pod Farm.

sV[Discussion] Guitarwriting: Ways to Approach Writing Leads and Solos (x-post /r/metalguitar)
p724
VJust reposting a discussion piece I submitted to /r/metalguitar\u000a\u000aBack with another couple of videos on leads, solos, and also some basic stuff on harmony for anyone who's not musically literate.\u000a\u000a[Basic Harmony and a Bit on Counterpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDTaTGAAHU)\u000a\u000aHere i just reiterate my opinions on basic theory and how much someone "should" learn if they want to become a better musician. Intervals, Chords, and Scales are the musical equivalent of elementary school grammer and knowing these things is enough to establish musical literacy and expand the way you hear and think about music.\u000a\u000aI also talk a bit about counterpoint and how I use it to create more intermediate harmonies when I write basslines and leads.\u000a\u000a[Approaching Leads and Solos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzyyW4_zes8)\u000a\u000aThis is a boring video where I talk the whole time, but I bring up a couple of things to keep in mind when preparing to write a solo. Namely, does the solo actually contribute to the song? This depends on the music you are trying to create of course. One virtuoso like Muhammed Suicmez will shred on every Necrophagist song, but another like Jari Maenpaa only solos on the appropriate song.\u000a\u000aIf you think Janick Gers contributes nothing to Iron Maiden and only ruins Adrian's original solos live, you'll love this. \u000a\u000aThen, the rest of the video is an update on my project for like, the 10 fans I have, so ignore that if you don't care.\u000a\u000a[Technique for Writing Solos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcmMj2ummD8)\u000a\u000aThe bread and butter video. First I distinguish between Leads and Solos, at least the way I see it. Then we get into techniques you can use when writing solos - arpeggios, sweeping, and tapping. I introduce a way to write simple solos by using these techniques to create transitions and connect individual melodies. I also do the tapping part to Eruption acoustically on my Jackson for fun\u000a\u000aI don't remember the rest of the video and I hate watching them again after I finish editing, but I probably end by talking about my project again since it's tied to the concepts, so again you can ignore that.\u000a\u000aThoughts? If there's anything I missed, or something you'd like me to go into detail, let me know. I'm very close to running out of content and I feel like I've fallen too deep into making videos to just go back to writing music anyway.

p737
VHey all. I have an old Jackson Dinky Reverse Performer that I'm trying to get back in to shape. I would like to order a replacement bridge and locking nut for it but I'm having difficulty finding any information. I've called Jackson but since this guitar is from 1999, they don't have any information on it(the guy said he didn't have any prior to the Fender merger/takeover). The bridge is branded Jackson but is Floyd Rose licensed so I don't know if that means a standard bridge will fit or anything.  I'll follow any leads anyone could potentially provide me with. And thanks!\u000a\u000aImage: https://imgur.com/L1zyDmA

I use the "death metal" drum kit, at least parts of it, and some EQ in Studio One. Just have a listen: https://soundcloud.com/rekator/farthest-forever-track-3-demo-6\u000a\u000aCost is no matter.

All instruments, vocals, and production was done by me in my "new studio."\u000a\u000a[Listen on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/thurisazm/waking-to-the-nightmare)\u000a\u000aThis was kind of an experiment before I go record the rest of the songs on the demo (a faster d-beat core song, a doom-sludge song, and a few songs combining those).\u000a\u000aHere is the recording equipment I used (hence the pathetic drum sound):\u000a\u000a* Drums --\u000a&gt;  1x AT2020 USB mic over the drumset  \u000a&gt;  1x SM57 mic in the kick drum  \u000a\u000a* Guitar -- (Blackstar tube distortion pedal into a Peavey Powered EQ, Peavey Booster, Peavey Power Amp, into a 1x15+1x4 / 4x10+1x4 / 4x10+2x3)  \u000a&gt;  1x AT2020 USB mic in center of room  \u000a&gt;  1x SM57 mic on the Sunn Model 3 cabs, a few inches from the speaker cone  \u000a\u000a* Bass -- (Same as guitar setup, no Blackstar pedal)  \u000a&gt;  1x SM57 mic on the 1x15, a few inches from the speaker cone  \u000a  \u000a* Vocals --\u000a&gt;  Had my roommates lock me in the recording closet.  Vodka + SM57 + a sock  \u000a\u000a* Production --\u000a&gt;  Audacity  \u000a&gt;  FLStudio 11 Producer Edition.  Both mics recorded simultaneously and independently (finally).  \u000a\u000a*The next songs should be a significant improvement: More mics on the drums, more drum equipment (non-shitty cymbals), Sunn amp head, streamlined recording process.*  \u000a  \u000aKnown issues with this mix:  \u000a* Drum impacts do not cut through  \u000a* Cymbals are super bright and obvious  \u000a* Some unwanted low-frequency mud on the guitar  \u000a* Bass doesn't quite punch in the face yet  \u000a* Shoddy slicing/transition between riffs at the end

p766
VDesigned to be used as the only impulse response following your amp sim, whether VST or Axe FX/Kemper, and to match the guitar tone heard on the album. Tweaking matters, but generally speaking, these will sound best if you use mild settings on your tube screamer and amp. Treble/presence 5-7, bass 6-8, mids 3-5. \u000a\u000aExit wounds: https://www.dropbox.com/s/w3x7g8vhbwp5bt2/Exit%20Wounds%20IR.wav?dl=0\u000a\u000aDeathless: https://www.dropbox.com/s/toorv43l2soeboo/Deathless%20NEW%20IR.wav?dl=0\u000a\u000aIf anybody's interested in making one, you just find an isolated guitar part on an album you like, put it in your DAW, use an eq match (Ozone and FabFilter have fantastic ones) to match your cab-less amp sim tone to the reference tone, then apply that EQ match curve to a frequency spectrum sweep test tone, leaving a second or two of room on each side of the tone. Export that file and then load it into a deconvolver (Voxengo has one, so does ReaVerb). The deconvolved file is your impulse response. Just make sure to normalize the level of the test tone so it's loud, and of the filtered test tone so it doesn't clip. :)

p786
VAlright. I've been a metal fan for a long time. My favorite was when good Swedish metal ruled the earth. Soilwork, The Haunted, In Flames, that kind of stuff. I'm always on the search for good melodic but brutal metal. But every time I listen to a new metal band these days their solution is just to tune down a couple of steps and chum chum chum. It's fucking stupid not to mention mind numbingly boring. Where are the Lamb of Gods, and Killswitch Engage's of the metal world? Am I just missing them?

Even though the verse sounds wrong, it feels to me that it is exactly how it should be. Does anyone else experience this?

VI have been trying to record the first song off of an EP I intend to come out with, but I am facing some difficulty with getting the right sound. I am recording with a Fender Mustang 1 amp that has a lot of presets and effects, a usb to plug into a computer, and gain, bass, treble, volume, and master volume knobs and a Ibanez GR-something. When I try to record into Logic Pro X (only DAW I have), the palm mutes sound really static-y and the tone ends up really bleh. I am wondering if I need to invest in something like POD Farm or get a new amp. I am hopefully getting a job soon but for the meantime my budget is $100-$150. Any ways i can fix this?

p807
VHi all. I play lead guitar and I do a lot of solo work. I have an Ibanez RG350DX. I saw the Schecter Hellraiser and I fell in love with the look, but I'm wondering if this is more of a lead or rhythm guitar?\u000a\u000aFirst of all it has a glossy neck, so it may not be as fast. The neck is a bit fatter too, and the cutaway isn't as big so the 24th fret may be a stretch.\u000a\u000aDoes anyone own this guitar and play lead? Maybe I'm just used to my Ibanez, but god damn if the hellraiser isn't the prettiest guitar I've ever seen.

If I plug my guitar straight into the 2i2, is it better to switch the channel to "Line", or " Inst"? Because I was getting a lot more clipping and gain when using the "Inst" setting.

Comparing to songs like [Cosmic Keys To My Creations And Times by Emperor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzBCmrk2oIw), [Through her silvery body by Swallow the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWciyO2sID4), [Rising Force by Yngwie Malmsteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9DHFUIrbA), or my personal favorite [Cosmosgenesis by Gru](http://youtu.be/ygiq6AMBGko?t=23m27s).\u000a\u000aI just have a simple midi keyboard interface ([Edirol PCR-50](http://www.roland.com/products/en/PCR-50/)), so I assume whatever I need to get this to work would be a VST or some virtual instrument. I'm using ableton and I've been spending some time just going through the default sounds it comes with, but nothing seems to fit or even come close. I just wanted to know if anyone could give me some tips or point me in the direction to some info about achieving this kind of sound because I'm pretty lost and I can't seem to find anything on the subject.

VThere's a group of music makers who compete in a two hour challenge to compose and record a track every Sunday at 20:00 UTC: http://www.reddit.com/r/2hourtracksundays Personally, I think they need more metal, so I'm turning to you guys.\u000a\u000aEach week a theme is introduced and the participants are given two hours to compose and record a song around that theme with a 15 minute grace-period to upload the 'finished' track to soundcloud. Even if the song isn't polished it's a good kick-in-the-rear toward breaking out of writers' block or the like and I thought I'd share it.\u000a\u000a[Here's the link to this Sunday's info](http://www.reddit.com/r/2HourTrackSundays/comments/298gnq/june_29th_12th_2hourtracksundays_event/)

p876
VI'm going to ask this subreddit my guitar related questions from now on because when I do it in /r/guitar, no one takes me seriously or shits on my question.\u000a\u000aI've been using ernie balls for the last year and they are half and half with me. I need to change my strings because I was getting a buzzing noise on the 4th string. The reason? The string was bent at the bottom and I didn't notice until I molested my strings thoroughly. I play in drop C and usually get light top/bottom heavies. I also use a Gio Ibanez something and Epiphone Les Paul. Suggestions for brand or gauges?

sVLet's Talk Bass, Week V: Effects! (plus a bonus about harmony)
p881
VSo, oops, I totally forgot to make the post at the usual time 'cause my mid-day was way busier than Thursdays normally are. Sorry.\u000a\u000aTo make up for this*, in addition to the promise of effects, I'm going to talk briefly about harmony, as that's an important part of counterpoint that I missed earlier.\u000a\u000a**Harmony** is essentially the relationship between any two notes. The distance between the notes is called an *interval*. There are twelve intervals in the twelve-tone scale. I'm going to describe them in descending order of how frequently you hear them.**\u000a\u000a- *Unison* is two pitches that are the same. Unison is the equals sign. This is *usually* between two instruments.\u000a\u000a- A *perfect fifth* is from C up to G, E up to B, D up to A. This is one of the easiest intervals to use, as it's one of the perfectly consonant intervals. It's the basis of a power chord, along with...\u000a\u000a- The *perfect fourth*. This is C up to F, E up to A, D up to G. Guitars are tuned so that between each string there is a perfect fourth (with one exception). This is the second of the perfectly consonant intervals. "Perfect consonance" simply means that there is zero suspense or dissonance in the harmony. This forms the other half of a power chord, stacking on top of the perfect fifth. Both of them together form...\u000a\u000a- The *octave*, which despite its name is an interval of twelve notes. This is C to C, E to E, et cetera. This is even easier to use than the perfect fifth for harmony.\u000a\u000aNow let's get into imperfectly consonant harmonies, which can add tension to a chord.\u000a\u000a- A *major sixth* is one full step greater than a perfect fifth. This interval is often used for a "big" feeling in contrast to the fifth.\u000a\u000a- A *minor sixth* is one half step greater than a perfect fifth. This is similar to the major sixth, but has a darker feeling to it.\u000a\u000a- The *minor seventh* is one step above the major sixth and one below the octave. This is more frequently used in major-keyed works than you would think. It's often used to lead up to the root, which we'll get to later.\u000a\u000a- The *major third* is often what defines a chord as major. The basic major triad is the root, a major third, and a perfect fifth. Occasionally one may add a minor seventh, as the number of notes between each of them is the same, resulting in an odd consonance with some suspense.\u000a\u000a- A *minor third* is one half-step below a major third, and like its major brother can define a chord as minor. The basic minor triad is the root, minor third, and perfect fifth.\u000a\u000aNow let's get to dissonant intervals:\u000a\u000a- The *major seventh* is one half step below the octave. They clash because of how close they are. The same applies to...\u000a\u000a- The *major and minor seconds*, which I am grouping together because you RARELY see them in a chord.\u000a\u000aThe last harmony, the ultimate in dissonance, is the Diabolus In Musica, the *tritone*. This is halfway between a perfect fourth and a perfect fifth. It is occasionally called an *augmented fourth* or a *diminished fifth*. This is really freaking dissonant. Great for effect, but use at your own risk. Dave Ellefson calls this the "Metal half-step", referring to it being a half-step up from a fourth.\u000a\u000aThe best I can say about these harmonies is play with them, learn how they sound and what they can mean to you, then start integrating them into your basslines. Fifths, fourths, minor sixths, and minor thirds are great as color tones.\u000a\u000aNow that we've covered harmony briefly, let's get to the meat of this week: effects! I wasn't satisfied with how little I covered effects in Part II, so I'm going to remedy that now. We'll start with distortion and the three grades of breakup.\u000a\u000a*Overdrive* is a light breakup of tone, intended to sound like a tube amplifier being pushed just a bit. It creates a slight compression in sound, as the peaks in the sound get clipped irregularly, creating a warmer tone. Some examples of different overdrive sounds:\u000a\u000a[Subtle tube amp drive, with roundwounds on a Spector NS-2, played with a pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxxpzNyYMQU)\u000a\u000a[Subtle tube amp drive, probably with flatwounds on a Rickenbacker 4001, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGQtH-8zqRI)\u000a\u000a[Medium-heavy drive, with roundwounds on a MM Bongo, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaOsLfttcrQ)\u000a\u000aNotice that many of these also have heavy attack. Overdrive and heavy attack go together well.\u000a\u000a[Heavy drive, with roundwounds on a Sadowsky J-style, played with a pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4qwzLaFZkg) - Hear that buzz!\u000a\u000a*Distortion* is heavier than this, with a lot of clipping, but there is still definition to the notes. In other words, you can hear the attack of the note as it gets played. Some examples of this distortion:\u000a\u000a[Heavily modified Rickenbacker 4001, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyaKtAyVVac)\u000a\u000a[Rickenbacker 4001, blended with some clean signal and played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ieVlpixUEs)\u000a\u000a*Fuzz* has zero definition. The audio signal of fuzz bass looks almost completely square.\u000a\u000a[Primitive fuzz, probably on a Rickenbacker with flats, played with a pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXGSBgr8sbg&amp;feature=kp)\u000a\u000a[Fuzz blended with some clean signal, bass unknown but probably either a Warwick or a Yamaha, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJczQIliEdU)\u000a\u000a[Fuzz mixed with a synth effect and clean for the attack, bass unknown, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1cSLmKUYak) - Most of Muse's catalogue has fuzz on the bass, or at least a heavy distortion, always blended.\u000a\u000a[Fuzz-wah up to :41, heavily modified Rickenbacker 4001, played with fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM0cdYVNXB8)\u000a\u000aIn addition to these, the most common effect on bass in metal is compression. This limits the peaks and generally makes the volume sound more even. This is great for fixing little deficiencies in playing consistency, making your notes roughly the same volume. Too much can kill your dynamics, though.\u000a\u000aNow, let's get into a couple of the less orthodox effects.\u000a\u000a*Phaser* gives a spacey sound. A fantastic combination I discovered is a phaser mixed with a heavy overdrive, as [in the intro to this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDqzFbAIWsY). There is also some fantastic overdrive and fuzz-wah later.\u000a\u000a*Flanger* is similar, but has a more metallic quality than a phaser. You can hear a flanger on the bass breaks in [this instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU7uGKV7d4E) (at 3:02 and 3:34), as well as subtle flanging on drums in some of the drum breaks.\u000a\u000a*Wah-wah* is hard to describe, because the name says it all. It makes the bass go wah by rapidly sweeping a fixed boost of a narrow frequency band. It can also be left on a spot to enhance a frequency range. Cliff Burton was by far the most famous bassist to use the wah, but Geezer Butler and Chris Squire used it before him on songs like NIB and The Fish. Latter-day bassists using wah include Paolo Gregoletto, who uses it on pretty much every bass solo he takes, including "Becoming the Dragon", "Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis", and "Incineration: The Broken World".\u000a\u000aThere are wahs made for bass. They will get you a sound more like Paolo or Geezer, much less like Cliff. To sound like Cliff, you need a fuzz-wah, which is extremely hard to find. Cliff's was made by Morley, the Power Wah Boost, but it is not made anymore.\u000a\u000a*Chorus* is the last pedal I'd like to discuss. It creates a subtle doubling sound, like two instruments are playing at the same time. [Here's a sample of chorus paired with heavy overdrive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmvhVPd_Tws).\u000a\u000aThat's all I can think of. Feel free to ask me about other effects.\u000a\u000a*Actually, I was planning on including this anyway.\u000a\u000a**Based on stats pulled out of my ass.

VI've played a lot of shows and been able to get by with just my amp distortion, but here are the issues I've had that I'd like to finally correct: a lot of feedback at times, solos not cutting through, and mediocre clean tone. It's evident to me that I'll probably need a noise gate and some kind of solo boost. So how can I use a noise gate without messing up my clean channel and boosted lead sustain? Also, how can I activate multiple effects at once? For instance, I'd love to be able to hit just one pedal to switch from distortion to clean AND activate reverb and delay, etc. Any suggestions?

VCritique on the mix would be nice. Issues that I'm already aware of:\u000a\u000aMy mic does a real shit job at recording my clean tone, so that's why the guitar sounds terrible on the first half.\u000a\u000aIdeally I can get real drums, or at least a better program. The one I currently use randomly picks one of two options for each drum sound in order to "improve realism" on playback. Unfortunately, sometimes they sound radically different, especially on the snare. This is especially noticeable on the last section, where there's supposed to be a snare hit on every beat but instead it sounds like the snare is dropping in and out because option 2 is softer than option 1.\u000a\u000aFun fact: The scream before the final verses was supposed to come in a bar earlier but I missed the cue.\u000a\u000aFun fact 2: Didn't include the link.\u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/brianjleong/obsidian-heart-1st-demo

sVSome basic recording questions
p929
VThese are probably pretty dumb questions but I just wanted to check.\u000a\u000aSo I understand that for rhythms typically you'll double track, panning one to either side. Is this also the case for harmonized rhythms? (For example, you would have two guitar tracks still, panned to either side, and one side would be the lower rhythm and the other side would be the higher rhythm?)\u000a\u000aAlso for leads I understand that typically you just single track the leads in the center. For harmonized leads, would you have two centered tracks, or would you pan the two tracks left and right?\u000a\u000aSorry for the very basic questions!\u000a\u000a

sVLooking for vocalist for power/doom metal in Brooklyn, NY or general NYC area
p940
VLooking for a vocalist/frontman or frontwoman for a power/doom metal band in Brooklyn, NY. We're currently a trio, but none of us have the ability to sing and give our instruments our all at the same time. We're really just starting out, we have written maybe 2 full songs but without a vocalist they are incomplete. We have a fully-set-up place to practice and record, we really just need this missing piece of the puzzle. \u000a\u000aWe'd prefer a singer that is between the ages of 18-24, since that's our age range. It's a plus if you have lyrics of your own that you'd like us to work on! Sub-genre is subject to change, depending on your abilities. All of the current members (Lead guitarist, bassist, and a drummer) listen to a wide-variety of metal, so it's not too much of a problem; we are willing to play anything except for the 'cores and death metal.

sVDoes my "strategy" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.
p950
VSo, as i said, i'm about to do some death metal styled vocal recordings / cover stuff, and i need an opinion of someone more experienced to read out my strategy and give me some pointers. \u000a\u000aIn a few days i will order a mic and an audio interface, so i still have a few days to think about what i want to get, money is not an issue, but im looking into keeping it around 300-400\u20ac. \u000a\u000aFor the mic i thought i would go with a classic Shure 58, mainly because i haven't heard a single bad thing about it, and its withing a reasonable price range for amateur usage:\u000a\u000a   http://www.thomann.de/gb/shure_sm58_set.htm\u000a\u000aFor the audio interface i chose Line 6's UX 2, pretty much for the same reasons as the mic:\u000a\u000a   http://www.thomann.de/gb/line6_pod_studio_ux2.htm\u000a\u000aNow, i plan to record the vocals through the UX 2 to my laptop with USB connection, the program im using to record is called "Sonar x3" (any other program you would recommend?), also i will run the whole thing through LIne 6,s build in program "pod farm" Does this seem like a working solution?\u000a\u000aAlso, if i'll move on to doing vocal cover videos (which probably will happen) i was thinking of recording the actual video with my Nikon D3200 camera, muting the audio of that video, adding my vocal track and the actual song on top of the muted video from the camera.\u000a

sVAnyone had good experiences with Kickstarter?
p963
VSo I'm hoping to record my first album/EP this summer or in the fall. I'm thinking EP because I want to just do my first 4 songs on this release, and that's approximately 30 min of music. About as long as a typical full-length but I think the number of songs makes it an EP. I don't know. \u000a\u000aI have little to no solid fanbase- about 33 followers on soundcloud and a couple hundred views on youtube, 35 FB fans. I'm hoping once I make a kickstarter I can garner enough support through reddit and metal forums to make it work. The studio I'm planning on going to is only 25 dollars an hour so I was going to shoot low for my goal and just cover the rest out of pocket. As one who is paying off student loans, any little bit will help. \u000a\u000aSo anyway, just wondering what your experiences have been Shreddit. If you want an idea of my sound, please visit my soundcloud here: https://soundcloud.com/dr-ug-1 I've got one song recorded from a couple years ago, but I've since revised it and done the drum programming all myself as opposed to having my friend use Superior drummer beats. All my songs are tabbed out in tuxguitar if anyone reeeally wants to hear some of the new material. Thanks for reading!

I think I can write decent lyrics, but vocals from my own mouth doesn't mesh with anything I do.\u000a\u000aI'm looking for someone who wants to work with me with and maybe push out a rough EP??? I don't know, anything could happen, right?\u000a\u000aI've got some of my more polished ideas on [my soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/lane-huitt), and plenty saved in my messy Ableton folders. I'm open to anything.\u000a\u000aPM me if you want to do something.

Sounds a bit like Ola Englund's Feared band at times.\u000a\u000aIt was all done ourselves. Recorded, mixed, mastered etc by myself.

sVI want to start recording a demo project. Where do I start?
p973
VHello /r/metalmusicians! I'm a metal bassist and composer in need of advice.\u000a\u000aSo, I have written a couple of metal songs in Guitar Pro and I have ideas for a few more. I thought it would be cool to actually record these songs into a demo project, mostly for fun and to learn new things. Where should I start and what would be the best methods for doing it? I would prefer not to buy any new gear, or at least spend as little money as possible. Consider the following things:\u000a\u000aFirst of all the quality of my equipment isn't too great. Squier Affinity series P-bass and a 20-watt Harley Benton amp are what I use for playing bass. I can play guitar aswell, but I don't own one so I could either borrow my friend's gear or get him to record the guitar parts. I don't own drums nor can I actually play them.\u000a\u000aAlso what comes to recording equipment, I have no idea what is actually required to record a somewhat listenable demo. Ages ago I bought a USB-interface, Miditech Guitarface II. Is that good for anything at all? \u000a\u000aIf you guys figure out how to actually plug the instruments to my computer (which should have a decent soundcard btw), what kind of software do I need for recording, mixing, mastering etc? Since I don't have any real drums I might have to use a drum machine or something, right? Guess there's software for that too?\u000a\u000aThat's pretty much everything I guess. Hopefully you can point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance and ask if I forgot to mention anything!

sVLet's Talk Bass, Week III: Writing Basslines
p979
VLast week I said we were going to be doing counterpoint, but then I realized I should probably do something more basic before counterpoint, as not everyone needs to use counterpoint in their music. So this week, we're going to talk about constructing basslines.\u000a\u000aIn my first post we talked about pedaling and doubling as tools for playing bass, as well as "color tones". Now, I'm going to introduce a few more things, then show you how to use them in context.\u000a\u000aThe first thing I'm going to teach you is the minor pentatonic. This is a very simple and incredibly useful scale in metal. Here is the A minor pentatonic scale tabbed out:\u000a\u000aG|------------------\u000a\u000aD|-------------5--7---\u000a\u000aA|-------5--7---------\u000a\u000aE|-5--8---------------\u000a\u000aIn terms of tonality, this is hitting the minor third, the fourth, the fifth, and the minor seventh, which are very common intervals that sound harmonically good in most contexts. Thus, not only is the pentatonic useful as a standalone melodic tool, but it is also useful for those color tones I talked about before. Also, note that the scale goes both ways. The minor seventh to this scale, for instance, is both up on the 5th fret of the D string, and on the third fret of the E string. Remember that.\u000a\u000aA related scale to the minor pentatonic is the blues scale. Here's the blues scale tabbed out, starting at A:\u000a\u000aG|------------------\u000a\u000aD|----------------5--7---\u000a\u000aA|-------5--6--7---------\u000a\u000aE|-5--8--------------- \u000a\u000aA very simple addition changes it. Now you have that odd note in there, the tritone, made famous by Black Sabbath in their self-titled song. Though it's called the blues scale, it's also very popular in metal for the simple reason of having the tritone.\u000a\u000aOne last scale to note is the basic minor. Tabbed out, starting at A:\u000a\u000aG|------------------\u000a\u000aD|-------------------**5**--**7**---\u000a\u000aA|----------**5**--**7**--8---------\u000a\u000aE|-**5**--7--**8**--------------- \u000a\u000aThis is the full minor scale, and as you can see it has the minor pentatonic within it (bolded). What the minor scale has that the minor pentatonic doesn't are the second and the minor sixth. The sixth being a half-step up from the fifth makes sliding between those notes very easy, which can help writing a bass line.\u000a\u000aNow, normally you'll be working with a guitar riff, so I'm going to demonstrate using these with a bass line I wrote based around a guitar part. [This](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38920383/Diabolus.aif) is from a song with my band. Excuse the roughness of the playing and the mix; I recorded it maybe ten minutes ago.\u000a\u000aThere are three main riffs in this, two of which are mostly doubling the guitar. I'd like to draw attention to the third riff, though, the one under the guitar solo. This draws primarily from the minor pentatonic. I've tabbed it out here (note the tuning is a half-step down):\u000a\u000aF#|------------------------------------------------------5--5-5-5-4\u000a\u000aC#|----------------5--5-5-5-5-5----5-7--7-7-7-7-5-7--------------5-7\u000a\u000aG#|-7--7-7-7-5-7----------------7--------------------------------------\u000a\u000aD#|-------------------------------------------\u000a\u000a\u000aUnlike the example, this is starting on D#. Now, I don't start by going up, but by going down, to the minor seventh on the fifth fret: C#. That creates a simple three note "down-up-up" figure going up to the minor third, which I repeat to take us up to the fourth. Now, instead of going for the fifth, I repeat the down-up-up figure to the minor sixth, leaving the minor pentatonic, then playing another three-note pattern to return to the fourth, and back to the root.\u000a\u000aNow, note that I did all of this without moving my hand up the neck at all. This is the magic of the pentatonic scale: you have a number of intervals ready to use without moving your hand up and down the neck.\u000a\u000aThat's about all I can really teach about writing basslines. The rest is up to you. Experiment!\u000a\u000aI leave you with a few of my favorite melodic basslines, along with the scales they use.\u000a\u000a[Fade to Black](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y90Ir8-VOWE) - Metallica - mostly uses minor + minor pentatonic\u000a\u000a[Lines in my Hand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXd6WqS5vjA) - Opeth - uses some Indian scales\u000a\u000a[Limelight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-kQsVk8K4c) - Rush - uses a lot of fifths, fourths, and octaves, as well as the major scale\u000a\u000a[Vital Signs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWBPgtB9m3E) Rush - More inverted fifths and major scale.\u000a\u000aThanks for reading.

VTopic says it all.\u000a\u000aWhen I really want to get something out there, I can usually do a good job and expect a hundred hits or so within the first day, but after that, activity calms down. I noticed some people (usually bands) get significantly more followers or listeners on soundcloud. Do you have any advice for this sort of thing?\u000a\u000aRight now I'm just a bedroom musician but my band &amp; solo project will have a albums out in a few months. Do you think actual bands tend to get more hits? Also where else do you post link to new material? This sub is usually my first stop, but I also like to go to other metal forums or Ultimate Guitar and share my work. I try to comment on other's music a lot too, to get people interacting, and hopefully others return the favor. Once I have an actual bandcamp page up, I'll be putting it in all my forum signatures and probably go to /r/metal and a few other places to just promote music. I'll submit to Last.fm, Pandora, and youtube etc. I'm wondering what else you guys can suggest as far as DIY digital promotion goes. Thanks.\u000a\u000aP.S. Another idea is to give digital copies of my work to those underground bloggers that post download links to metal albums. Anybody have a list of some that haven't really been blocked/have a lot of followers? I don't intend on making it rich with these projects so the next best thing is just get a bunch of people to pirate it haha.

sVMy guitar and rig haven't really changed in 6+ years. I'm starting to do my own production and thought maybe I could use some new gear. Would love some suggestions.
p1037
VJust a little about me- I've been playing guitar for most of my life (i'm 25). I love it and I've been writing for years and years. I love playing, but I've never really been into the gear aspect of things. Partially because I never really had the money to, but also I have to admit I was always a little intimidated walking into guitar center or something. So, I made due with what I had and tried to be proficient with it.\u000a\u000aI finally decided that I wanted to learn about recording and production so I could put an album together of my original stuff. This process has made me wonder if it's time for a change. I've used the same equipment for almost 6 years and I feel like I've outgrown it. Here's a [picture](http://imgur.com/dm43vuq) of all the equipment I own.\u000a\u000a* Ibanez RG2EX1 (V7 V8 pickups)\u000a\u000a* Fender Frontman 25R\u000a\u000a* Digitech RP80 multi effect pedal\u000a\u000a* Metal Muff distortion pedal by Electro Harmonix (This is my primary pedal, whch I actually bought this year. Everything else is 6+ years older)\u000a\u000aIt's not much but as someone who's just a hobbyist I've always been happy with my little setup. It's served me well while in college and apartment life, but now that I have a job and I make good money I'd like to invest in something a little better.\u000a\u000aThe recordings I do use impulses, so I'm not in a huge hurry to replace my amp or pedals, so I think foremost I'd be the most interested in upgrading my guitar. I would certainly love to get suggestions on everything though since I do just as much playing plugged in to my amp and pedals when I'm just messing around. I primarily play heavy metal and here is one of the [recordings](https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/immolate) I've been working on just for reference, but I keep the multi effect pedal around even though it's like 8 years old just because I like the option for different sounds when I want to mess around and jam.\u000a\u000aI think at the most i'd be willing to spend about $500 for a new guitar. I'd love to get some small amp suggestions for someone who still lives in an apartment within roughly the same price range.\u000a\u000aI would really appreciate any feedback/thoughts/suggestions you guys might have. Also I wasn't sure if this is the right place to post about this, so if it isn't I apologize!\u000a\u000aThanks in advance!

Vso i have never had a guitar with a floyd-rose system on it before, but moreover i have never fully optimized any of my guitars for what i end up specifically doing with it (because there is a guitar for every occasion, right?!). \u000a\u000anow i have a nice little strat-style electric than i'm basically outfitting for death, thrash, and black metals, and it has a floyd-rose. i hear that pretty well anything you do to a guitar is going to affect the intonation, and i have done a fair bit to contribute to that on mine, including:\u000a* replacing stock tuning heads with grover mini-roto's\u000a* replaced both stock humbuckers\u000a* use heavier-gauge strings (usually 11-52)\u000a* tune to C#/drop B\u000a\u000ai got the guitar secondhand, so no idea if anything was done to the bridge before i got it; i'm sure it's not dialed in for my specific purposes.\u000a\u000atl/dr: how important do you consider a properly intonated bridge is, and do you have any tips or resources?

About 25% of time do we have a sound tech doing it for us.

sVPain in wrist while playing
p1044
VI've been practising Laid to Rest by Lamb of God lately, trying to get the speed up to match my drummer who plays everything about 20bpm faster than on the record.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I do struggle with the song even at normal speed and I was playing along with the CD earlier, and on my third run through I got this weird pain in my wrist (on my fretting hand). \u000a\u000aI immediately stopped playing, since I don't want to fuck up my playing forever. The pain was still noticeable for maybe a minute or two after I stopped, and after that it was gone. I haven't played since, this was about three hours ago.\u000a\u000aIs this a problem with my technique? Is it to do with the difficulty of the song and me being unaccustomed to playing at that speed? I don't want practise badly and end up screwing myself over so I'd appreciate some advice on this.

If I go with a cheaper interface I'll probably dedicate the rest of the budget I'm working with right now towards a new guitar.\u000a\u000aPretty much any information/opinions on the pros/cons of these different setups \u2013 or even a completely different setup suggestion \u2013 would be great!

sVHow do you "dirty up" the sound (specifically harsh cymbal tone?)
p1055
VHi. I'm going to work on a solo doom project soon and all I've used so far for my thrash and grind are randomized acoustic drum samples. They sound decent (they'd sound better if I knew how to EQ properly lol.) Anyways, I'm really interested in heavy and harsh metal productions in doom. I want to know how you get that sound that makes all of the cymbals seem really washed over one another like one really big long crashy sounding hiss. Take a listen to these songs briefly and just spot the loudness of the overall tone but especially the HHHCCAASSHHHAASSHHH kinda thing in the background.\u000a\u000aMonothiest would be a classic reference point.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1t1Sti8Z3M\u000a\u000aBut especially a lot of stuff from Church of Misery, In think they offer a good example.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7eP-DFReyA\u000a\u000aSo what's the secret? Is it just boosting the high frequencies or a whole ton of compression? Should I put my cymbals through a distortion filter? What do you guys do in general to your tone/EQ process to make it sound more metal? Do you have a specific process or just find default presets you like in an advanced DAW and then leave it alone? My rig is pretty bare bones and I want to know what I can do to get those results.

They're very open and I just want to feel out what they're capable of. Can't think of fun metal songs for them to learn quickly. Any ideas?\u000a\u000a Any genre is acceptable really. a few  bands we all know are along the lines of three days Grace, killswitch engage, and sort of heavy rock bands like that.

sVLooking for some mixing and mastering advice
p1097
VSo my old band recorded a song before breaking up: we did it with zero cost, recording drums by assembling two electronic drum sets together, one of which was borrowed for free, and recording guitar, bass and vocals at our respective homes. I used Studio One 2 for tracking and mixing, Superior Drummer as a drum machine, Studio One 2's built-in Ampire as an amp sim, and Revalver for cab simulation.\u000a\u000aWe didn't get to actually finish recording everything: there are some backing vocals missing, the bass is really just a guitar track transposed an octave down (a placeholder until I could record bass), and the guitar solo was recorded with our lead guitarist's amp instead of via direct-in.\u000a\u000aContent warning, it's a power metal song.\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/niexs/the-new-sunrise\u000a\u000aIn my opinion it sounds kinda alright, but listening to it after listening to properly produced tracks is jarring. It sounds very cold and abrasive, which really doesn't fit power metal.\u000a\u000aSo do y'all have any suggestions? Any general or specific advice for remixing this? Presets to share, guides to read, anything?\u000a\u000aThanks in advance.

Do they amplify the output of the already powerful head?\u000a\u000aWhat is the difference between a 1x12 and a 4x12? (Outside the number of speakers)\u000a\u000aHow many cabs can you connect/is usually connected to a head? What affect does more than one have?\u000a- (This might be dependent on the head)\u000a\u000aWhy do some musicians have a couple of heads and a couple of cabs on stage? (Matt Pike playing in sleep for instance)\u000a\u000aPedals \u000a\u000aSometimes the overdrive of the head has enough distortion that I'm looking for but what happens when you add a pedal before entering the head and combining the OD of the head and the effects of the distortion pedal? Is this taste related?\u000a\u000aIs it possible to connect into the head, out to a pedal and then back into the cab? What is the achieved effect?\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks guys, sorry for the amateur questions but any advice is much appreciated. \u000a\u000a\u000a

p1137
VSo i was looking for a new guitar. This will be my second guitar, the first being an Ibanez RGA 42 FM. i like it, but i think its getting old and i think its time for me to change my sound a little. I play metal almost exclusively.\u000a\u000aSo here is my issue. I have a very specific image in mind for the guitar, but being a teenager with only a summer job, my budget isnt unlimited. Under 1000 dollars is ideal. I cannot find many guitars that fit my specifications, that are in my price range.\u000a\u000awhat im looking for:\u000a\u000anot a gibson or a fender. I have played many friends guitars of both companies, and they are not my type of guitar.\u000a\u000amaple or walnut neck \u000a\u000aebony fretboard \u000a\u000atremolo \u000a\u000a24 or more frets \u000a\u000abody wood can be alder, maple, or something similar. mahogany is not ideal, but with a maple top, it is ok. \u000a\u000aPreferably some sort of 'metal' shape, but thats obviously not as important\u000a\u000asomething i thought of was finding a cheap custom shop (if those exist). if anyone knows of one, that would be great.\u000a\u000aany suggestions would be awsome, guys, and thanks in advance!\u000a

sVHow do you people write lyrics?
p1140
VI figured I could write out lyrics without any real music behind it. I would write out a super rough copy is a basic format then after the all the other tracks are completed, I could "re-rock" my lyrics into fitting with the song. I've been told this is completely wrong and you can't really do it.. That doesn't make sense to me. What's your style and plan of attack when writing brutal lyrics?

sVHow can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)
p1153
VI have no idea how to word this correctly or even explain it, so bare with me.\u000a\u000aEverything I write is simplistic and bland. I feel like my ability far surpasses what I'm able to write, and it's frustrating to say the least. My knowledge of music theory is admittedly poor, but I'm working on fixing that through the free online sources I've found over at r/musictheory, but I know that that wont fix everything. \u000a\u000aI've been playing primarily metal guitar since I was 11, I'm 23 now and I feel, like the title says, stagnant and it's really getting me down. I've always loved metal and ever since I covered Hangar 18 with a friend when I was 17 and got all my solos down I was sold that Metal was what I wanted to play and write (of course my taste has strayed away from Megadeth since then). However, I've never been in metal bands. My primary instrument has always been guitar, but I always end up filling in on drums or bass for punk or similar bands. Don't get me wrong, I have fun with these bands, we play live frequently and the music is fun and enjoyable. But I'm not playing my favorite instrument, or my favorite music, and sometimes it feels like I've sold my soul. \u000aI don't really have any friends who like metal, well ok, none of my friends like metal, most of them despise it, so I never really get to jam some metal or even talk about it. So, perhaps that's another big reason for my shitty writing. But what are some exercises, or tips, y'all could give me for making my writing better. If I must, I can give you a shitty recording of my shitty riffs, just please, be gentle lol.

Well, during the install I took out the two single coils and put dupes (the pickup housing with foam shoved inside) in there place for aesthetics. \u000a\u000aI can get away with the single AHB-1 for now, but I want to put two active single coils in to compliment solo's, cleans, and crunchy cleans. I'm looking for a bassy midrange punch with clear highs. The only ones that I can find that really attract my attention are the EMG - S single coil actives. Any thoughts or advice?\u000a\u000aI'm looking for a Death metal tone similar to Beyond Creation, Behemoth, Nile, Necrophagist, Vader, etc. \u000a\u000aEMG link:\u000ahttp://www.emgpickups.com/guitar/single-coil/strat/sa.html\u000a\u000aJackson Dinky:\u000a[Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/zB0j9#0)

Good thing we did. I want to say a huge thank you to Disillusion Effect for having us fill in for them and to Reanimator for letting us use their guitar cabs and bass rig. This was our first time playing with a major label act. I'm still excited and wanted to talk about it! Still kind of surreal having got to open for such a bad ass band!

I really want to play some atmospherice death/groove metal. Ideally it would be cool to find people that are capable of recording themselves both at their instrument and maybe video clips along the way to put together is a meta-reddit metal band. I have played hundreds of shows and everyone knows how hard it can be make a living playing metal. My idea is to get 4 or 5 people together with a similar taste. Record on our own documenting it along the way and sending it back to me and ill pay for ot to be mastered on the audio level and professionally edited for video as a short documentary on the process. The kick... we really dont know eachother. Ideally it would be cool to get redditors all over the board involved in video, marketing, artwork etc... maybe we could eventually to a reddit meet up metal show.

Each track deals with a sleeping disorder and musically I've written across a range of my influences in metal. \u000a\u000a[Bandcamp](https://apathybm.bandcamp.com/album/in-somnia-ep)\u000a\u000a[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58OnC7_FMm4&amp;list=PLufiw_AG5FNEnBVWljKRsNh8WXbtDVwG9)\u000a\u000aWhat this means is that I can finally return to doing my discussion type videos. I want to talk about the songwriting process from my experience as an amateur and I hope it'll be helpful but the scope is pretty big and I'll need to take my time planning everything out.

p1241
VHello.\u000aSo here's my problem.\u000aI used to be able to scream using the "clearing throat" technique. I had a problem using this as it would hurt my throat (But after doing it a while it would be fine and I could go on for hours) and I had big difficulties doing lows. So I switched my technique around for something else.\u000aNow what I was doing recently was using my throat mucus for the distortion. The problem now is that I cannot scream loudly and I don't believe that this is a reliable technique that anyone uses (Right?). Besides, this technique mostly allows me to focus of the lows, but I cannot switch from this technique to the other one as they contradict each other.\u000a\u000aWhenever I try something new with my throat placement or whatever, it seems that the sound just doesn't come out. Or when it does I feel like it's hanging on a string, like I can feel the sound slip in my throat and it does a short "Nails on board" kind of sound, and this usually mean that I cannot continue screaming for the day.\u000a\u000aI'm at a loss here. I'm not sure what to do.

sVCould I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?
p1263
VSo I've been in the process of writing my own atmospheric black metal as a one man bedroom project sort of thing. It's based on Jupiter and the four Galilean moons (Ganymede, Io, Europa, and Callisto), each song being based on one moon, and the intro and outro tracks are a two parter based on the big guy himself. I'm going for a spacey and bright ambient atmosphere that's focused on melody. Think [Caladan Brood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6iHvKbDjs), but space themed rather than medieval fantasy themed. As for the recording and whatnot, that's what I'm not too sure of. Since you guys know far more about recording than I do, I thought I'd ask here. Basically what I've got to work with is two guitars (an Ibanez RG350DX and a no-name seven string), a Fender Mustang I amp, which let's me record guitar onto my computer, a Blue Snowball mic, and GarageBand. No bass, no drums, no keyboards, just my guitars, mic, and GarageBand. Given the style of metal that I want to go for and my lack of gear, would I possibly even be able to record this album at all? Could I program all the drums and other instruments using nothing but GarageBand and still make it sound good? I'm not sure if this could even work. I know that black metal is known for its jury rigged recording setups, but every single black metal band I know of used real instruments for everything. I've got a guitar, a mic, and Skrillex's favorite computer program. So is this possible or not? I'm broke, so this is all I have to work with.

p1273
VHey r/MetalMusicians, I'm beta-testing a new site called Fanum where independent artists can post their music, and fans do the promoting by using one of their 3 per month "headphones" to favorite/support the artist. Currently, there's absolutely no metal section. There are less than 300 artists signed on so far, and as a life-long fan of metal, I'd love if I could recommend some of you guys to the beta test using your Soundclouds. Even if this website does not take off, what do you have to lose? Thanks!\u000a\u000aHere's the description for the artists' section from the website: \u000a"On fanum.fm, artists can spend more time making music and less time seeking out ways to market and promote it. We've gathered music's biggest fans all in one place, a place where they are constantly and actively searching for new talent. Fanum.fm is more than just another outlet for promotion. It takes the mystery and the luck out of "being discovered" and gives you the best shot at making it big and sharing your sound."

sVQuestions about bass amp choices
p1275
VI'm looking to buy my first bass amp for gigging with metal. My question is, does it really have to be a head and cab separately, or is it reasonable to look at combos? My issue is purely based on budgetary restrictions. (Also, would this question be answered different for guitar amps instead of basses?)\u000a\u000aIt just seems to me that in bars and small places, when I see people perform with giant amps, it looks like a bit of overkill. And even in larger venues, once the amp is mic'd, how important does it need to be super super blasting?\u000a\u000aBelieve me, I'm a total beginner when it comes to gear, so please set me straight. But should I be looking for a specific wattage, combo or not?

sVReturning to guitar, thinking 7 string
p1279
VHi guys. I haven't played in 15 years. I played classical guitar from about 13-17. Really wanted to play metal but parents did not really appreciate that. Then got busy with college, career, etc. Career involved constant travel. Long story short, I was decent 15 years ago but haven't touched a guitar since. Finally no longer travel and recently realized "Hey, I can play whatever the hell I want now and I finally have a lot of free time."\u000a\u000aSo this time around I want to start right and play the music I want to play.\u000a\u000aSince I am going to be re-orienting myself, I think I should start with 7 string instead of my muscle memory going to 6 first then adjusting to 7. Just start with 7. I have the fundamentals down (ie, scales) from my earlier playing. Watching a few youtube videos the past few days and this stuff has been flooding back from the dark corners of my brain. Only thing left now is to pick a guitar and play.\u000a\u000aOn that note, been researching guitars to choose what to buy. Amazing now being able to watch so many videos online of different guitars and hearing their sound being played by talented people.\u000a\u000aFrom my research, these are the attributes I want:\u000aGood crunchy sound\u000aFloyd Rose &amp; neck through (was always a huge fan of high pitched solos and bends - alas my nylon acoustic wasn't the best platform)\u000aComfortable fretboard\u000aWant to stay under $500\u000aDon't want to have to change pickups at first. Want something decent but honestly I am not going to be good enough for a while to appreciate the difference in high end and midrange pickups and I won't be in a recording studio or on a stage in the foreseeable future.\u000aI also don't like buying a cheap thing to then replace it with a better thing later. I like to buy something once that will last me a long time that I can grow into.\u000a\u000aI found a lightly used $400 bc rich jrv 7 (purple 2010) that seems to have what I am looking for. Any other suggestions? Plan to buy it on Saturday.

sVSuggestions for amplifying/EQing heavily drop-tuned guitars?
p1350
VI'm preparing to write/record some material for what's effectively a 2 bass, 1 guitar arrangement. My first bass is in E0 A0 E1 A1 D2 and I'm pleased with the tone. My guitar in boring old E-Standard, and sounds like what I had in mind. My main problem comes from my "bass" guitar, in E Standard an octave below standard E Standard (27" scale length, 24 - 84 gauge strings). I gave up on running this guitar through my guitar amp even when it was in B-Standard/Drop-A. Instead I've been running it through my Traynor TB100 bass amp (100 watts, 15" speaker).\u000aI'm running my guitar through a Boss DD-7 delay, an Eleca EDT-3 Distortion, and finally Electro Harmonix Cathedral Reverb before amplification. I'm aiming for a really heavy arrangement, in a vein similar to Love Sex Machine or Black Sheep Wall, with some Drone influences in the style of Sunn O))). I find that my current sound lacks a certain "body" and "punch", and the attack of my notes feels weak compared to the sustain. I've wanted to avoid going overboard with my amp's bass knob, but since my bass is tuned so low (~20.6Hz fundamental on the lowest note), I'm not sure if there would be too much overlap in the low end. Does anyone here have any suggestions?

sVLet's Talk Bass, Week I: The Bassics
p1352
VPardon the pun. Or don't.\u000a\u000aI had an idea to start a weekly-ish post/column/thread about bass in metal music. So that's what I'm doing. I'll cover a variety of topics in this, including gear, theory, and technique. I'm going to try and be as all-inclusive as I can in terms of subgenres, but to be blunt some subgenres just don't have much happening for the bass.\u000a\u000aFor today's thread, we're going to discuss some of the basic roles of the bass in heavy metal and get the age-old debate out of the way: Plectrum (pick) or pizzicato (fingers)?\u000a\u000a**THE ROLE OF THE BASS**\u000a\u000aIn brief, the role of the bass in metal is the same as in any other style: *groove*. What's groove? Let's back up a second. The guitar and the drums are radically different instruments both in style and in role. The guitar is primarily a melodic instrument in metal, and drums are primarily a rhythmic instrument. But they need to play together, otherwise the song falls apart.\u000a\u000aThis is where the bass comes in. The bass, to paraphrase Megadeth bassist David Ellefson, is like mortar between the bricks of guitar and drums. It holds them together. The bass is often described as not being heard, but being *felt*. That thing you feel when a bassist is playing right, *that* is groove. It's where the melody and the rhythm meet to propel a song forward.\u000a\u000aAs a demonstration of this, listen to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhxycDKlaf4). You have four legendary metal songs ("Peace Sells" by Megadeth, "The Trooper" by Iron Maiden, "Sweet Leaf" by Black Sabbath, and "For Whom the Bell Tolls" by Metallica) being shown, first with the bass removed, then with the bass put back in.\u000a\u000aIn addition, you notice another thing the bass adds: heaviness! Without those seismic low frequencies, it's hard for a band to be heavy. Some bands have been trying to avert this with bass-heavy guitar sounds and lower tunings, which we'll get to later, but suffice to say for now that it's very difficult to cut bass out of a band completely.\u000a\u000a**SOME WAYS TO PLAY THIS ROLE**\u000a\u000aHeavy metal being a 40-year-old genre with subgenres out the ass, there are a lot of different ways to play bass within the context of metal and still sound good. To put it another way, there is no one way to play metal bass. There are, however, several tried-and-true styles that are good for any metal bassist to know. The ones I'll cover here include **pedaling** and **doubling**. Other styles that will get their own threads include **counterpoint** and **lead bass**.\u000a\u000a**PEDALING** is the easiest style to learn. In order to play a pedaling bass-line, all you need is a chord sequence and a drum beat. The goal of pedaling is to lock *with the drums primarily*. The easiest way to do this is to play on each hit of the kick drum, usually on the first and third beats of a four-beat measure (we'll get into time signatures later; suffice for now that most pedaling is in "Common Time," which has four beats per measure, each beat marked by a quarter-note).\u000a\u000aOnce you have established a rapport with the kick drum, you can get a bit more adventurous, playing eighth-notes and moving to different roots as the chords change. However, you are not playing a melody when you are pedaling. Pedaling is primarily rhythmic, with the harmonic element of keeping the chord present in the listener's mind.\u000a\u000a"Color Tones" (my term) can accentuate a good pedaling line. A Color Tone is when the bassist deviates from the root *briefly*, often in a way related to what the guitar is playing. Common intervals for a Color Tone include fifths, an octaves, minor thirds, and fourths.\u000a\u000aGood pedaling players include [Ian Hill of Judas Priest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kOxLxTldFw) and [Tom Araya of Slayer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--0cnhEgfI0) Also Cliff Williams of ACDC.\u000a\u000a**DOUBLING** is exactly what it sounds like: doubling the guitar riff. This is a risky technique, as the basis of your playing is not the drums, but the guitar. If you're not careful with this, you can lose the groove and end up with a sloppy-sounding song.\u000a\u000aGood doubling players include [Cliff Burton](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCDYBbg3jk) and [John Myung](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaOsLfttcrQ).\u000a\u000aNow, note that none of the linked bassists have used these styles exclusively. Cliff Burton, for example, does some pedaling as well as doubling, and even does a counterpoint fill in "The Four Horsemen". David Ellefson does a lot of doubling in Megadeth's thrashier tracks (Holy Wars). These styles are tools of how you carry out your main task of establishing groove. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide when pedaling or doubling is appropriate, or any of the other techniques I'm going to talk about later on.\u000a\u000a**MANUAL TECHNIQUE**\u000a\u000aYou can play fingerstyle, or with a pick. There are upsides and downsides to both. I am going to speak very generally of both.\u000a\u000aFingerstyle generally gives a rounder attack and tone than pick-style, and in the opinions of some players is more expressive due to the increased tactility, as there's nothing between your hand and the strings. On the other hand, playing at high speeds with fingers can be difficult and exhausting, and some people find they cannot get a cutting tone with fingers.\u000a\u000aPicks give that cutting tone thanks to the pick scraping against the string, and have other benefits as well. The consistency that fingerstyle players must learn is of less concern to pick-style players. This is also useful if you started on guitar. On the other hand, playing pick-style incorrectly can give you *severe* wrist problems, up to and including carpal tunnel syndrome. It is also very hard to get the pick-scrape out of a bass sound when using a pick.\u000a\u000aFingerstyle metal (and almost-metal) players include Cliff Burton, John Myung, Geddy Lee, Geezer Butler, Alex Webster, Paolo Gregoletto, Sean Malone, Steve DiGiorgio, Steve Harris, Troy Sanders, and John Paul Jones.\u000a\u000aPickstyle metal (and almost-metal) players include Jason Newsted, Johnny Christ, Jeff Walker, Justin Chancellor, David Ellefson, Ian Hill, John Paul Jones, Lemmy, Tatsu Mikami, Dick Lovgren, and Chris Squire (not metal, but honorable mention for a fantastic tone).\u000a\u000aYou may notice that John Paul Jones is in both lists. He uses both! You should too! That's the best!\u000a\u000a**TLDR:** Groove.\u000a\u000aThanks for reading. Next week: Gear!
