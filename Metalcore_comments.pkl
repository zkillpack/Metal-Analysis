VAside from metal related music, what other genres do you fancy?
p1
(lp2
VHip-Hop!
p3
aVHip-Hop is probably my favorite genre behind metal/metalcore. What shit are you digging right now? I personally can't get enough of the new Joey Bada$$ project, got that coming in the mail. 
p4
aVlovin stuff from Hilltop Hoods at the moment
p5
aVI really love classic punk and alt rock mostly just the bands in my local scene, just went to one of the greatest gigs of my life.\u000a\u000aI also dig shoegaze and post hardcore and math rock and emo (proper emo)
p6
aVwhat shoegaze? Can I [blow your mind real quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEqL3lIaZq0)?
p7
aVFuck that was really good, a good chill thing to be listening at 3 in the morning, thank you a lot man.\u000a\u000aAnd I'm not at all an expert on shoegaze sorry I mainly just listen to the entry level stuff like whirr, some my bloody vallentine, new title fight, Ride, Death of lovers ( i'm not sure if they classify but i really enjoy them) . I am subscribed to /r/shoegaze and i listen to songs every now and then from them and i like them ,just haven't got around to delving deep into the genre.\u000a\u000aIf you have more stuff like LSD and the search for god i'd love to hear it. but if you can't be bothered its totally understandable. 
p8
aV[here ya go](https://kaironirse.bandcamp.com/album/ujubasajuba) it's the only thing I can remember off the top of my head...I'll keep you posted though!\u000a\u000aEDIT: [SLOWDIVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0LIO138Z-A) is essential listening for anyone getting into shoegaze. One of my favorite bands of all time along with [Have a Nice Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FUMl2gAM7c) and [A Place to Bury Strangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LcgO8YAxZI)
p9
aVSorry about the late I just listened to these all, and thank you dude. You have a sick taste in music, I first thought slowdove was amazing in its light way then I heard have a nice life and it was so good, It slightly reminded me of Amenra whom I love.\u000a\u000aThanks again, curious do you have a Spotify account? As I could imagine you'd have some good playlists
p10
aVI didn't know they had Spotify in Australia...I actually don't really use it all that often but if you have a last.fm hit me up in PM and let's talk
p11
aVTitle Fight just put out a pretty shoe-gazy album. 
p12
aVyeah I don't LOVE it...still too pop-punky for me. Interesting direction though
p13
aVIt grew on me after a while. It's nice to listen to in the car with your windows down. 
p14
aVI fucking love 30s-50s music lol \u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/GFfaR3I--zI
p15
aVI'm gonna go out of a limb here and say that that's because of Fallout? (relevant username) 
p16
aVYeah lol. After playing them I got hooked and now have hundreds of songs from that era. 
p17
aVI've been listening to the Title Fight's new album a lot lately, I'm not sure what genre that is
p18
aVIt's a great one. It's like a cross between shoegaze, punk, and emo. 
p19
aVI'm going to separate punk from metal entirely when I answer this question.\u000a\u000aI listen to a lot of pop punk, hip-hop/rap, screamo/skramz, emotive hardcore, alternative, electronic, etc.
p20
aVAny genre other than country, [MrSuicideSheep](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrSuicideSheep) has a lot of good music if you're into chill music et cetera
p21
aVI also listen to some radio pop (only single songs from artists, not whole albums), stuff like Billy Talent, Fall Out Boy, some electronic, some hip-hop, post-grunge (Breaking Benjamin!). Mostly different kinds of metal though.
p22
aVPost-Rock
p23
aVThe youtube channel 'Liquicity' has some pretty awesome music.
p24
aVReally into indie (from Haim to Sonic Youth), hip hop, a lot of dance music and J-rock.
p25
aVI like to listen to a lot of classic rock (like Creedence Clearwater Revival type stuff) as well as alternative rock and punk/hardcore.
p26
aVI love calireggae.  Bands like Rebelution, Tribal Seeds, and Backbeat Soundsystem always put me in a great mood.  It is pretty funny to see people react when I tell them I mainly listen to metal and reggae because they are pretty much opposites when it comes to overall feel.  
p27
aVTrap music is sick.
p28
aVMy three favorite bands are After the Burial, Deftones, and Lacuna Coil. My favorite band of all is probably Deftones, they have three songs I don't like in their entire discography.
p29
aVDifferent types of electronic, and sometimes instrumental stuff.
p30
aVOooh. I'm gonna get all the hate.  \u000a  \u000aI hit up the Indie Folk about as often as I do the Metal. It's weird, but I can't *not*.
p31
asVBullet For My Valentine - Turn To Despair
p32
(lp33
VAh, Bullet. My first metalcore band. The nostalgia doesn't always hold up. \u000a\u000aRemember in 2007 or whatever, when BMFV was going to be huge, and then BMTH came along and stole everything? I actually kinda feel bad for the former. Scene's changed so much. 
p34
aV[alt version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wUKeOV3Hos)
p35
asVIce Nine Kills - Chris Brown's Latest Hit
p36
(lp37
VI love this album.
p38
aVSuch a good album. They do great layered vocals.  \u000a"I'll give you once chance to...BAIL OUT"
p39
asVThe Sorrow-Crossing Jordan (KSE and ABR had a child)
p40
(lp41
Vthe dagger thrust is my favorite song by them 
p42
asVAnti Icon - Prophecy. Belgian awesomeness.
p43
(lp44
VIt's good that you are sharing Belgium bands but here are some essential Belgium bands, two of my favourites they are techincally metallic hardcore but more blackened crust and thats [Oathbreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGmDl6GQLAU) and [Amenra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cTLD3ywchE) I strongly recommend you seeing these guys and checking out these albums, its a completely different experience to normal metalcore.
p45
aVI'm a bit more of a metalcore/post-hardcore/prog/melodeath kind of guy. I know Amenra, but was never really that into them but I definitely get why they are being praised.\u000a\u000aDon't know Oathbreaker. I'll definitely check them out. :)\u000a
p46
asVKingdom Of Giants - Lion's Mouth (NEW Official Music Video)
p47
(lp48
VThat was pretty dope. I'm gonna have to listen to some more of their stuff!
p49
aVDude, one of the best albums 2014. Listened to it so much. Definitely check out all of their stuff, but they really stepped up their game this time.
p50
aVTheir whole new record is absolutely killer. I'm pretty strict, but I gave it a 3.5/5 over at SputnikMusic. My favorite track is Sky Burial, total ripper. 
p51
aVSky Burial is great!
p52
aVIt's one of the best albums of 2014. This album is amazing.
p53
aVJust noticed that they put out a lot of music videos for that album. Absolutely fantastic band.
p54
aVFilmed just like TDWP's [Assistant To The Regional Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYTzcubws7Y)
p55
aVHeard these guys last week and I gotta say, they kick ass!
p56
asVFrom Autumn to Ashes - The After Dinner Payback.
p57
(lp58
VOh man, I would listen to this song on repeat when I was in highschool. One of the first heavier bands I started listening to for sure.
p59
aVMiss this band so much
p60
aVhttp://www.altpress.com/news/entry/from_autumn_to_ashes_have_reunited
p61
aVHolding A Wolf By The Ears has been one of my favorite albums for years.
p62
aVClassic; so hard and so heavy considering the era during which this was released
p63
aVwhat do you mean? FATA were considered one of the more mainstream bands back then. even "too bad you're beautiful" is heavier than "the fiction we live". still a classic, but heavy considering the era? nah.
p64
aVNah?  Aight
p65
aVjust off the top of my head\u000a\u000awalls of jericho - 1999 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=741jHDx056k\u000a\u000amorning again - 1996 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-yglXsji8\u000a\u000aarkangel - 1998 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCoGfDW4bp0&amp;hd=1\u000a\u000aprayer for cleansing - 1999 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4kjHPQR5OU&amp;hd=1\u000a\u000athis shit is from years before FATA even existed and it still makes them sound pretty mainstream, no? I'm not saying FATA are/were bad, but HC and metalcore kids definetely considered them as mainstream back in the day. there is a difference. 
p66
aVWord.  All good music\u000a\u000aMainstream and Heavy are mutually exclusive.  Opinions gonna opinion.  Have a good weekend
p67
asVICATCHFIRE - Friends [pretty cool band i found on youtube]
p68
(lp69
sVLooking for some new bands to get into, but I can't find any that I really like.
p70
(lp71
VPhinehas. You will not regret the decision.
p72
aVNever would imagine that you could  shoot a music video at a mini golf course.
p73
aV[deleted]
p74
aVTrivium! So good!
p75
aVTrivium is great, but not exactly straight up metalcore, especially not anymore. It's definitely got a more "thrashy" element to it than "regular" metalcore. \u000a\u000aRegardless, they're definitely a great band, one of my favorites for sure!
p76
aV&gt; Heaven Shall Burn\u000a\u000aWell, Heaven Shall Burn are really heavy on the melodeath. So try some melodeath, like [Intestine Baalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiZz-EFQXfk), [Thread of Omen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au_-cE1Mg9Y), [Be'lakor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y87bVC8tG2Q). Or for some metalcore try [Johnny Truant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8WSoKzhVfY), [The Agony Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1wDLVJDFUk), [Himsa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kp3qF5w9pg), [All That Remains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wjGRxedtik), [Zao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3psqplTwYQ), [Living Sacrifice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOAe7COsGeg) and [Darkest Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTLsF31FvFQ). \u000a\u000aAlso [Skeletonwitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBA4_3RMJQo). 
p77
aVDon't forget At The Gates and Living Sacrifice.
p78
aVI wasn't sure if he'd like At the Gates, but I did link Living Sacrifice. 
p79
aVOh, I missed it, oops.
p80
aVGoing down the melodeath road I gotta throw in Insomnium. 
p81
aV\u005c&gt;not recommending the black dahlia murder
p82
aVI'm not really familiar with them. Not enough so to choose a track to rec anyway. \u000a\u000a
p83
aVYou really should listen, they're like the epitome of melodeath to me. Everblack, Ritual, and Nocturnal are my favorite albums by them.
p84
aV&gt;You really should listen\u000a\u000a[I have](http://www.last.fm/user/Amethyst_Star/library/music/The+Black+Dahlia+Murder). 
p85
aVDo Ritual!
p86
aVListening to it now, and it's great. I don't know how I feel about the JFAC influence though. It's kind of overpowering, especially the track On Stirring Seas of Salted Blood which just straight up sounds like a JFAC song. I think I prefer Nocturnal. 
p87
aVA Shrine to Madness is my favorite song on that album, I love how it sounds and the Halloween lyrics. But it's really surprising that you haven't heard it before. I understand liking Nocturnal more, but some of the songs start sounding similar after a while, overall I prefer Ritual.
p88
aV&gt;A Shrine to Madness is my favorite song on that album\u000a\u000aEither Blood in the Ink or A Grave Robber's Work was mine. The JFAC vibe just keeps most of the album from being "amazing" to me. But that's just me. \u000a\u000a&gt;But it's really surprising that you haven't heard it before.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't be too surprised. I haven't really been listening to mdm that long. \u000a\u000a&gt; I understand liking Nocturnal more, but some of the songs start sounding similar after a while\u000a\u000aI've only listened to each of them (Nocturnal, Everblack, and Ritual) once. So it might change over time. I like my mdm more on the power/ nwobhm/ thrash side. I definitely prefer something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDmR5aEicww), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlAQ0k1ZXfA) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqPl7Of46Nk). 
p89
aV* After The Burial\u000a\u000a* The Human Abstract\u000a\u000a* Reflections\u000a\u000a* Within The Ruins\u000a\u000a* Structures (All Of The Above EP &amp; Divided By) \u000a\u000a
p90
aVall of the above is so good
p91
aVThat comment's wording is somehow misleading.
p92
aVMy best suggestion at the moment would be Northlane
p93
aVParticularly the Discoveries album, based on OP's likes.
p94
aVI liked Singularity a lot more, but that's true, OP would probably prefer Discoveries
p95
aVConsidering you like Whitechapel and the heavier side of metalcore, I think you'd have a much better time finding stuff you like in /r/Deathcore \u000a\u000aBut since other people are recommending deathcore bands, I'd say try Acrania, new Carnifex, Boris the Blade, Despised Icon, Job For a Cowboy, and maybe All Shall Perish (Although you've probably heard a lot of these bands if you're a fan of whitechapel.)
p96
aVThy Art is Murder
p97
aVI am the
p98
aVEUGGHHH
p99
aVMy blood runs so damn cold every time I hear that
p100
aVEEEEEOUGH
p101
aVWhore to a chainsaw
p102
aVYou will see the true face of panic.
p103
aVI really like the new Periphery album(s), Refused is always a great listen, and of course Every Time I Die. 
p104
aVDeathcore-ish. But check out The Last Ten Seconds Of Life.
p105
aVhows the new album? Been meaning to check it out.
p106
aVVery different. It's like The Plot In You and King 810 had a love child.
p107
aVCheck out Devildriver
p108
aVthy art is murder, shai hulud, after the burial, i declare war
p109
aVBreakdown of sanity\u000a\u000aGhost inside\u000a\u000aParkway drive
p110
aVThey only have one EP out, but Before Ciada is sooooo brutal
p111
aVYou might as well try Converge
p112
aVMalefice, early Sylosis is very core, the rest closer to LoG and HSB, Death Of An Era, Veil Of Maya, Heart Of A Coward.
p113
aVFit for an autopsy
p114
asVAlbums you didn't like at first, but then ended up loving them
p115
(lp116
VSurprisingly, and even I don't understand why sometimes, but Architects's latest album took a little bit to grow on me. But when it did it hit me like a fucking truck.
p117
aVI completely agree with you. I had never previously listened to them and only checked them out because the album was getting so much attention. I found myself not really enjoying it the first couple times through, but now I can't seem to stop listening to it.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also Tracing Back Roots from We Came as Romans.
p118
aVSempiternal. I was new to BMTH at the time an thought Oli Sykes's voice sounded weird, but it really started to grow on me after I gave it a few tries. Specifically "Can You Feel My Heart" and "Shadow Moses" were what changed my mind. Now it's one of my most favorite albums across all genres.\u000a\u000aI guess an honorable, not-necessarily-metalcore, mention was Collide With The Sky by Pierce The Veil. I fucking *hated* Vic Fuentes's whiny voice at first but it somehow grew on me. Probably because I was a whiny teenager myself, but hey, we all were once. Still love PTV though
p119
aVYup, same for me. Couldn't stand Oli's voice for a long time, but I kept listening to Sempiternal because I liked the instrumentals. One day it just connected. Now BMTH is probably my favourite band and Suicide Season is probably my top metalcore album of all time.
p120
aVSo many albums, but i'l just list the major stuff.\u000a\u000aConverge - Jane Doe\u000a\u000aTouche Amore - To the beat of a dead horse\u000a\u000aLa Dispute - Rooms of the House\u000a\u000aDeafheaven - Sunbather
p121
aVSunbather was so much duller than their Demo EP
p122
aVI enjoyed it personally, what did you think of the new single by them?
p123
aVhavent heard it yet
p124
aVIt is quite nice haha
p125
aVI didn't like Jane Doe before either. Now I think it's a fantastic album and definitely one of my favourites 
p126
aVMost people don't like it the first time, its a grower haha 
p127
aVMetalcore:\u000a\u000aDarkest Hour - Deliver Us\u000a\u000aProtest the Hero - Fortress, and Volition\u000a\u000aAs I Lay Dying - The Powerless Rise\u000a\u000aKillswitch Engage - Alive or Just Breathing, and Disarm the Descent \u000a\u000aAtreyu - The Curse\u000a\u000aNon Metalcore:\u000a\u000aCryptopsy - None So Vile\u000a\u000aDevourment - Butcher the Weak\u000a\u000aIn Flames - The Jester Race\u000a\u000aThy Art is Murder - Hate\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p128
aVHmm, probably Life Through a Window from Structures. At first I only liked the song Buried but then I started listening to the whole album as background music and it just grew on me.
p129
aVI missed nicks vocals at first but it grew on me
p130
aVI wasn't a huge fan of Every Time I Die the first time I heard them because I thought Keith Buckley was dying on the mic. Ended up easing into Gutter Phenomenon and I loved them.\u000a\u000aWasn't a huge fan of Dance Gavin Dance when I first listened to Downtown Battle Mountain, but then I listened to Acceptance Speech and I was hooked.
p131
aVRise of the Lion by Miss May I
p132
aVThat was an album that I wanted to like, but I couldn't. 
p133
aVOnce I got used to the different screams I ended up getting pretty into it
p134
aVEvery BMTH and Northlane album.
p135
aVGlass Cloud - The Royal Thousand
p136
aVThe first time i listened to Hollow Crown by Architects I really wasn't into it, the production was so different to anything I'd heard before and I hated it. Now it's one of my favorite albums though, Early Grave is just so delightfully heavy.\u000a\u000aAnother one that really grew on me (although it isn't really considered metalcore) is Enter Shikari's A Flash Flood of Colour
p137
aVSempiternal. I didn't like Oli's vocals at first but they just grew on me I guess. That said, in my opinion his vocals on Count Your Blessings can't be topped.
p138
aVOh and pretty much all of BAAO's music.
p139
aVCount Your Blessings scared me the first time I heard it years ago... now I scream along to most of the entire album for practice x)
p140
aVNot an album but Rot by Northlane. First time I heard it, I thought it was alright but nowhere near the level of Adrian's Northlane. Then the more I heard it, the more I fell in love. I'm so pumped for Northlane's first album with Marcus.
p141
aVDisarm The Descent 
p142
asVHey guys! Those of you that like the new Bring Me The Horizon song without the shitty rap? Here yah go!
p143
(lp144
VIt's actually a really good song without the rap. If he had less electronic editing, i'd really like it.
p145
aVI was pleasantly surprised to hear the final result to be honest.
p146
aVWow that was actually really good.
p147
aVIMO it really doesn't need to have the rap removed. It's a good song already.
p148
aVI understand why you'd say that, just took a bit away from it for me :)
p149
aVYa, just preference I guess. I listen to a lot of EDM and rap as well so it really didn't bother me as much as it would someone who doesn't like either of those genres.
p150
aVim sorry but am I the only one that doesnt like this song regardless...? this is utter gutter music compared to BMTHs best and metalcore in general
p151
aVDoesn't compare to their other stuff but what I forgot to say was this is a rescore for the movie Drive. They did it for fun. And to try new things. Its not an official song by them.
p152
aVohh thank god
p153
asV"OF MICE &amp; MEN release crappy new #hardrock single"
p154
(lp155
VIt's insane how spot on this article is, especially the part about Aaron not being the frontman and why Austin is still in the band.
p156
aVI'm not even upset that this song was crap. I saw it coming from a mile away.
p157
aVThis band has dropped so low that its retarded.
p158
aVIt's like a cheap version of Chevelle. 
p159
aVAgreed, Aaron&gt;Austin. If they continue to this style, Austin is just useless and annoying. Video was shit btw.
p160
aVI love how people are still surprised all these bandwagon bands have jumped on another bandwagon.
p161
aVWhy is Austin still in this band, holy shit. Aaron has the talent to lead a band (Jamie's Elsewhere) and should be doing so. \u000aThis article is on point.
p162
aV&gt; Why is Austin still in this band, holy shit.\u000a\u000abecause they'd lose half their fanbase overnight.\u000a\u000asee: the jerry roush/jerry DOUCHE era OM&amp;M\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Jun278zso&amp;t=1m25s
p163
aVMoney is a factor in everything.....
p164
aVoh my god... linking park and disturbed had a baby...
p165
aVThe rhythm guitars are so low in the mix they might as well not be there.
p166
aVDude it's literally a Breaking Benjamin song in the most literal sense.
p167
aV&gt; Which means that they need to keep Austin in the band even though he quite obviously has no musical talent whatsoever and is basically just a prop who stands around on the sidelines awkwardly \u201crocking out\u201d while the actual musicians in the bands play\u000a\u000aThis seems a little harsh. His parts in new OM&amp;M songs are next to non-existent, but saying he has no musical talent whatsoever is harsh. The first two OM&amp;M albums were killer. His screams (when used effectively) are incredible. But their new "sound" is not utilizing his vocals. To say he's useless is wrong. I think he's under used. 
p168
aVUnpopular opinion warning:\u000a\u000aI didn't think the song was that bad.\u000a\u000aBut then again, I'm judging it for what it is, not what the band used to be.
p169
asVblessthefall - Guys Like You Make Us Look Bad
p170
(lp171
VMan this song brings back memories. Nobodies gonna deny that Blessthefall is infinitely better off with Beau than Craig, but fuck is this still a great album through and through.
p172
aVThis is the only blessthefall album I really liked from back in the day, but Mabbitt is quite the douche these days so I'd definitely agree
p173
aVWhenever I hear news of Craig it always seems like he wants to be Crown The Empire, but no teens girls like him so instead he acts like a dick....
p174
aVDude looks like the Mexican uncle who always acts creepy at get togethers nowadays
p175
aVIll probably ruin this song for others but all I hear at the chorus is, "And every time i think about your voice I...*shove a tampon in my vagina!!!*"
p176
aV/u/JarrodAlonge anyone?
p177
aV"LUCKY FOR YOU MY BUTTHOLE ISN'T VERY TIGHT"
p178
aVYou...... You bastard lol.
p179
aVOh my god I'm almost crying this is so funny
p180
aVgod damn it, I will never unhear this..
p181
aVGreat, now I have this and the bring me the horizon sandpit turtle
p182
aV...don't forget the special Bottomfeeder lyrics.
p183
aVIf I recall correctly, Craig Mabbitt lost a tooth filming this video. Got hit in the face with a guitar.
p184
aVTwo. Front ones. Not lost but cracked in half. 
p185
aVI always liked this song but damn the lyrics are dark
p186
aVSupposedly its about Craig's sister who was raped as a child.
p187
aVYea, I heard that too. Makes it that much sadder
p188
aVCredit this song as my introduction to heavy music. What a banger.
p189
aVFor the longest time I thought Beau was in this song, maybe it's just me but it seriously sounds like him.
p190
aVThis song fucking slaaaaaams dawg!
p191

p220
aVI was actually at this show! It was awesome, and it was on Halloween.\u000a\u000aI think the first album was their best - especially since it kind of got me into metalcore - but this album is still streets ahead of their last album.\u000a\u000aI really hope they go back to a harder sound - now that Danny is out of the band.

aVTechnically they're melodic hardcore but their last album was much more metalcore based. They're pretty much in between both genres now.\u000a\u000a^Don't ^kill ^me ^MWM 
p245
aVBut isnt metalcore itself a genre in between two genres? That could be kinda confusing
p246
aVYes and it does get kind of confusing. But that doesn't mean the genre can't exist. Listen to The Ghost Inside's "Returners" album, that is much more hardcore based with more melody to it. There really isn't much metal influence in it. \u000a\u000aI guess its kind of splitting hairs after a while but the distinctions in their music is there. Regardless, the genres are really similar to the point that fans of one are also fans of the other. 
p247
aVThe Devil Wears Prada - Outnumbered\u000a\u000aActually they do this a lot in general
p248
aVIssues has a bunch of songs like that, including Mad At Myself, Stingray Affliction, and stuff. Bands with two vocalists typically have stuff like that, like Oh, Sleeper, Silent Planet, Crown the Empire, etc.

aVCare More by TDWP in the second verse
p250
aVTo Be Scared By An Owl by Alesana, most songs off of The Emptiness have that as well
p251
aVA bunch of The Amity Affliction (especially the Chasing Ghosts album).
p252
aVA few INK songs have this and it generally sounds awesome:\u000a\u000a[The Fastest Way to a Girl's Heart is Through Her Ribcage](http://youtu.be/OM-Q3Cea1gs?t=1m45s)\u000a\u000a[Proximity Mines in the Complex](http://youtu.be/eiqZbdeIFOE?t=2m27s)\u000a\u000a[Connect the Cuts](http://youtu.be/p_imLWDWIGw?t=44s) (this is the best one IMO)

aVTwo weeks - All That Remains is probably the shining example of this. The entire song is uncleans layered under cleans. \u000a\u000aThough if you want more of call-and-answer Alesana does this well. 
p261
aVThe only one I can think of is Haste the Day's cover of [Long Way Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbNTBCL5veU). ([original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK6PiJCw_Jg) for comparison).

p263
aVErra has them in all the Moments of Clarity EP songs I'm pretty sure.
p264
aVYeah pretty much the entire second half of the song Dreamcatcher has it  
p265
aVQuantum Flux by Northlane has a part like that and it's incredible!
p266
aVI Prevail do it alot
p267
aVAdepts early stuff, like from Another Year of Disaster. They've got lots of songs where they scream and sing at the same time. 
p268
aVForever Unbroken by Fit For a King has some of that
p269
aVI think one of the best ones is from TDWP - And The Sentence Trails Off... It's at 2:07
p270
aVNot really "metalcore", but Listening to Freddy Mercury by Emery does it. Emery does it a lot actually.
p271
aVmy old band Tronwayne had a lot of that
p272
aVI know this isn't metalcore but most of my friends that are into metalcore *really* appreciate Scar Symmetry's Holographic Universe album. It has a lot of heavy and light vocals at the same time, as well as complimentary vocals. \u000a\u000aEven though it's Melodic Metal, I highly suggest it! It's by far their best album, and although their new singers are improving drastically (I was personally disappointed with their latest album) Unseen Empire is awesome.
p273
aVIce Nine Kills - Connect The Cuts, probably my favorite example of this
p274
aV[The Harvest](http://youtu.be/hOu2-LiTX4w?t=1m30s) by Wolves At The Gate 
p275
aVAs I Lay Dying does this a lot also.
p276
aVVisions by BMTH. The chorus has background cleans that really add another dimension to the song. Those vocals make it one of my favorites of theirs.
p277
asVGuitar players! I have a question!
p278
(lp279
VStandard for guitarists is the Ibanez Tube Screamer, a tuner pedal is also recommended. And please, don't scoop the mids because other guitarists will think you don't know shit... and it sounds bad. 
p280
aVDon't scoop your mids unless you play djent. 
p281
aV... really djent is all mids bro, at least I'm pretty sure.
p282
aVI can't believe I just reversed that. Gonna stop playing guitar forever now. 
p283
aVLOL its cool dude, we all have those days.
p284
aVWould I need a TS if I already have tube distortion on my amp?
p285
aVIt has a different reason be find using it, I always found this video to be very helpful. http://youtu.be/V79fQ7XLatg. 
p286
aV[deleted]
p287
aVIbanez TS9!
p288
aVtube screamer plus a pedal called "metal core" will pretty much give you the sound you want. you'll also want to have at least one noise gate/suppressor. Pick up a few patch cables and you're set.
p289
aVMetal Zone and Metal Core pedals sound the same, but the extra tone controls on the Metal Zone pedal can really change the sound. MZ is much better.
p290
asVYou know how facebook is trying to get money off bands, Cody Stewart of The Browning are fighting back against those policies, sign here to get it removed!

p293
aVIt'll bring awareness to facebook that people are pissed about. MAYBE just maybe they'll change it. Doesn't hurt to do it though
p294
aVWell said. Even if it doesn't succeed, it'll at least promote discussion about how to change it - which means physical, in-person promotion instead of relying on Facebook.

asVFeed Her to the Sharks - Fortitude (Full Album Stream)
p297
(lp298
VI kinda wish he would ditch the cleans. His voice isn't bad but his melodies are super underwhelming a lot of the time.\u000a\u000aAlbum is solid. Gotta say the first single set my expectations a little too high though.\u000a\u000aAlso, does the production on this one bother anyone else? Sounds pretty muddled to me. 
p299
aVYea mix is a bit muddy and imo a bit too quiet. Overall I thought it was better than Savage Seas but not as good as TBoF.
p300
aVYup their first album remains their best. Always a shame when that's how it goes, you always want a band that releases an awesome debut to build on that. Oh well.
p301
aVthis album is tits \u000a\u000aso far I like it just as much as their other two \u000a\u000aone of the only "metalcore" bands that I seem to care for tbh \u000a\u000aI am normally a deathcore/death metal guy but this band just shreds way too hard to be a genre snob in any sense of the word\u000a\u000aone of those bands that really transcends their "genre" IMO 
p302
asVWould you guys be interested in an AMA from Michael Schleibaum of Darkest Hour?
p303
(lp304
VYeah!
p305
aVJust something to note though, a lot of times when bands start promoting these AMAs on their facebook/twitter, people make accounts and come on here specifically to ask the questions, so while this thread may not have a lot of responses, there will still probably be a decent amount of interest.
p306
aVExactly, I first made my account because of an ABR AMA
p307
aVAh yes. I forgot that this is /u/ForeignAndFamiliar reincarnate.
p308
aVYeah, I was just getting really annoyed by that name, so I changed it
p309
aVHmm, that's true. I just didn't want to an AMA if it was going to kind of flop. Last year we had something like ~40 AMAs here and this year I am way more busy than I used to be, so I'd rather aim for quality rather than quantity if you know what I mean.
p310
aVThat makes sense. I don't listen to Darkest Hour so I don't really care either way, but they seem to have a pretty big fanbase.
p311
aV[deleted]
p312
aVGet Austin Carlile to do an AMA on /r/corejerk instead.
p313
aVclosest we've come was caleb shomo doing an /r/corejerk ama a little over a year ago where he talked about being in attack attack! with austin carlile. he deleted his account a little while afterwards, so not sure how an austin carlile ama would go over there.
p314
aVin all seriousness, if there is ever an OM&amp;M AMA here (probably not b/c this subreddit would crucify them) it would be my dream to have him post in /r/corejerk just ONCE lol.\u000a\u000ai mean i've been in contact with rise records' publicist for past AMAs, so i could try for an AMA from a band like OM&amp;M or whatever, but it would just go really, REALLY horribly.
p315
aVYes please.
p316
aVI'd probably miss it anyways because you're always arranging these things in American time, but that would definitely be interesting!
p317
aVTo be honest it isn't me that sets the time, I just tell them when we have peak traffic (most traffic here is on Wednesday/Thursday during late afternoon/early evening ET). Then they come back to me with whenever they decide to do the AMA, and only like half of the time they do the day/time that I suggest lol.
p318
aVNo problem man! I realize that the main demographic is American and I'd be stupid to demand to delay the AMAs. If it's really important to me, I'll find the time anyways.
p319
aVSure, that would be fun!
p320
aVIf there's a low turn out, I can just ask 50 or so questions, I won't mind.

aVThe reason I love these guys is they don't take themselves seriously at all, and their music is pure party metal and it's a hell of a time moshing to it. People that sit there and whine about how awful they are and how they're trying to be gangster are just fueling their fire. Plus I met Fronz at Warped last year and he's the most down to earth guy I've ever met.   Edit: A word

aVThis is just stupidfuckingshit..
p351
aVWell damn I guess people hate Attila around here :/

p365
aVThe post wasn't even downvoted on /r/PostHardcore and to be fair it's not Post Hardcore it's Metalcore. Now my opinion on the song itself; it was okay. The vocalist and the drummer have great potential I liked the uncleans a lot however the cleans and the generic strings left me wanting something better. at least the drummer tried to change it up but it seemed like they just wanted to go chugga chugga chu chu!

p384
aVCan you do that? At my school there's like 1 metalcore kid and one osdm / melodeath kid and there's 2500 students here, hip hop and rap is what everyone listens to here.
p385
aVfind out what the process is to start a club and go for it! Usually they require a number of interested students to sign a document before officially becoming a club (at least in the states), but if you advertise you'll probably find some interested folks.\u000a\u000aI'm currently the head of my uni's metal club and we did something similar to get started. 
p386
aVI thought you and Verb the Noun were on a world tour for the whole school year?
p387
aVThat might be better when I head to Uni as my school only has Christian and Asian groups pretty much but at the end of it, I could possibly put some banners or get it to be announced. I'm sure there'd be one at my uni otherwise I'll make it.
p388
aVHave you spoken to all 2500 students?
p389
aVNope but off the ones I know so I guess 500ish of them (well enough to know/guess there music taste) my school just isn't big on metal, hardcore or any of the subgenres well at least that I'm aware of. We had a post rock band last year which had dudes that listened to mean as music but they are gone.
p390
aV95% of the time you can look at a person and instantly tell whether or not they're into the same kind of music as you. The other 5% will probably surprise you
p391
aVMay I kindly ask what the rock and metal fans look like along with the rap, classical and jazz? 
p392
aVidk man. i'm sure there's a lot more metalcore kids than 1 in a school w/ 2500.  My school had at most like maybe 2000, and we had a dope scene with tons of hardcore kids
p393
aVI'm sure there's a lot more just I don't know them, my school is strict as like we all have to have short hair and wear a rigid uniform so it's really hard to tell off looks if someone likes the genre, the thing is also if i do find someone that likes metalcore/ post hardcore that don't even know the bands i like.  
p394
aVGotcha. I know this sounds weird, but a lot of the kids in the scene I went to school with were kinda nerdy, so check out like card shops or like comic stores.\u000a\u000aEDIT: you can also check local skate shops or local stores that might have local shows posted
p395
aVbruh i listen to PWD i'm a jock okay dude.\u000a\u000aNah haha i could kinda see why so, i couldn't go to either to be honest I'm just not that guy. I go to a few shows just generally its quite far away or its r18 (which won't be a problem soon) but my mate who's a bit younger has set up a black metal band so thats always good, I'm also kind of picky with core music like there is a lot crap out there in my opinion and it influences too much local bands haha thats just my mathcore view haha
p396
aVLocal shows start talking to people, wear band shirts and see if people  know them, convert your friends haha
p397
aVJust like, say something about the band?  Like, "Oh hey, you like Periphery?  What'd you think of their new album?"\u000a\u000aI definitely would be open to meeting people in the scene, just don't want to come off as awkward or anything lol
p398
aVYeah i understand you fully, i dont think ive ever seen a band shirt of a band that i like except for the La Dispute show, but just be like "oh nice shirt, they are pretty sick [then ask them a question]" i have felt like i haven't made many friend off the scene but i did find my last girlfriend (kinda) though i don't go to heaps of hardcore shows more alt rock  so different people i meet.\u000a\u000aGood luck for you, I'm sure you have a better scene over there than here haha
p399
aVI mean, I'd love to have/friend a group of people to go to "hardcore" shows, but the scene is non-existent here in northern New York, lol.\u000a\u000aI'll have better luck when I move to the Boston-area in a few months.  I know a LOT of bands usually swing through MA.

(lp463
VI liked the solo, but I'm personally not the biggest fan on the parkway drive style of metalcore, you have some stuff going well, but i feel that  vocally it could have been done better ( mix/production? i'm not sure). like the vocals could have been a bit harsher if you know what i mean, but if that's just the vocalist that will come with time.
p464
aVHey! Thanks for the comment! I'm the guitarist so thank you for saying you like the solo! Haha... We're a newer band trying to work out our sound and  style so it'll all come with time, but I really appreciate the listen' thanks man'
p465
aVNo problem bro, the fact you have a lead and riffs is a good start no matter what. Any future songs, I can listen to, I'm just really into Converge and Mathcore bands so most metalcore is passable for me, but I was glad there was cool guitar parts and no autotuned vocals. \u000a\u000aGood luck for the band and everything!

aVIt feels like they've gone backwards, meh is the word.
p472
aVI saw them on that Attila tour with Like Moths to Flames and Crown the Empire and they were the opener. It was my first time seeing them so I was looking forward to their set. Never have I heard such horrible playback in my history of going to shows. Granted, it was the first night of the tour and maybe technical difficulties were about, but it was the roughest sounding performance I've ever heard. Everything was muddled together and I had no idea what they were playing.\u000a\u000aTheir light up drum set was pretty dope tho.
p473
aVI like certain songs on the Death Card, (Deadpan and Snake Eyes are very good songs IMO), but their new stuff is pretty disappointing. Also, their live performances used to be sick, but Tyler's vocal abilities have gotten considerably worse. Watch a live video from just after the release of the Death Card and then compare it to their shows from the past couple months, you'll see what I mean. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT- Also barriers self titled EP is some of the angriest metalcore I've heard, its much better than sworn in imo\u000a

(lp484
VABR has constantly been having Christmas merch, and no one's seemed to care, this doesn't really seem much different other than that it's a band with a fanbase with more potential to milk money out of. Doesn't seem like too big of a deal, gimmicky merch isn't exactly a new thing, and I have to say I enjoy my ABR Christmas sweater quite a bit
p485
aVLabels exist to milk money from fans. Why does this surprise you?
p486
aVThey're laughing all the way to the bank, I could care less lol. It's all merch; how you make money.
p487
aVI don't quite think this counts as "selling out". \u000a\u000aIt's just themed merch. 
p488
aVthis exactly
p489
aVWell... since records don't sell anymore.. I guess merch is the best way to make some dough... \u000a\u000aBut yeah, valentine's days themed stuff is pretty funny.. like stupid funny
p490
aVAs much as I think OM&amp;M has sold out, plenty of bands are doing this and they're completely allowed to do it.
p491
aVcalled a business plan bro
p492
aVWho was it Periphery or ADTR with the thong underwear merch for valentines day? New ways of making a dollar in the music business I would imagine.
p493
aVHonestly, I don't know why stuff like that is such a big deal for people. Noone forces you to buy it and in the end it's just another type of merchandise.\u000a\u000aDunno what's so fancy to rant over evertything.
p494
aVit's more concerning to me the effect that it's having on their very impressionable fanbase who will probably pour their parents money into buying this stuff. nobody forces you to buy McDonald's either but it's still bad
p495
aV&gt;nobody forces you to buy McDonald's either but it's still bad\u000a\u000aAnd it's entirely your fault if you get fat and die of a heart attack from it. You drove to the store. You shelled out ten bucks for a meal and stuffed your face full of shit.

p568
aVAll bands dropped and the label is done. Joey stole from every band and didn't pay anyone.
p569
aVJoliet was lied to and they even had to pay quite a bit of money out of pocket to record their debut record. Feel bad for a lot of the bands on that label that were promised success and never saw it. I would honestly say if the bands on this label wanted to join another Christian label Solid State and Facedown are probably your best options to find some success.\u000a\u000aI also ordered a tee shit from their merch site and it took them 2 months to get it to me. I had to open up a dispute with PayPal to get their attention.

They aren't breaking much new ground and don't show off the "experimental" side of the genre, and follow the typical metalcore sound, but they GO FREAKING HARD and is quality metalcore. A good song to pick would probably be [[Warpath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWyjqMqb09M)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWyjqMqb09M).... Or maybe [Hollow King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjdfBJwhtE8), (but that's partially because it's my favorite FFAK song)

aVI don't know why that song gets a lot of love. I like it, but I also feel it's the worst song off the album. Animals is the showcase for metalcore off that album.
p665
aVProvision is up there I feel too 
p666
aVProvision live is amazing.
p667
aVWhile I agree that it's not the best on the album, I feel like it's the song off the album that best represents what metalcore is
p668
aVShai Hulud "Set Your Body Ablaze"\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9bysPRKubQ

p670
aVnot enough cleans maybe lol too much teenybopper shit on this sub reddit
p671
aVThe Final Episode
p672
aVTo me this has always been the epitome of mainstream metalcore. They generally follow the scream verse/sing chorus/scream verse/breakdown formula and besides their small amount of electronic segments it's pretty straightforward metalcore.
p673
aVBirthday Parties For Puppies - Sirens and Sailors. Its the song I always showcase.
p674
aV[Sirens &amp; Sailors - Birthday Parties For Puppies](http://youtu.be/UJ2cidq0otk)
p675
aVThanks for the link. I'm on mobile and can't link it!
p676
aVI just listened to the album yesterday, and ice been listening to the more recent one pretty frequently. Sirens and Sailors play a large part in my decision to go to warped tour this year.
p677
aVIn my opinion all of their albums are great. Excellent musicianship and Kyle has some of the best screams. I never get tired of them.
p678
aVOh I agree. I listen to them probably 3-4 times a week. I listen to music while I work, so I repeat albums a lot
p679
aVWell. Probably a Parkway Drive or ABR song. \u000a\u000aOr something off of Shadows are Security by AILD. 
p680
aVAtreyu-Bleeding Mascara
p681
aVFor early 2000's style metalcore, Lip Gloss And Black by Atreyu. \u000aLater style, Early Grave by Architects.\u000a"Modern" metalcore, Dispossession by Northlane. 
p682
aVDeparture - In Hearts Wake ft Winston Mcall\u000a\u000aLiterally the epitome of metalcore in a song.
p683
aVIf what you mean is not "the best" or "most acclaimed", but something thats slightly generic, and well-embodies/describes the genre, I would go with something off of Bring Me The Horizon's Suicide Season. Maybe "Chelsea Smile" or "The Comedown". Those were some of the songs I used to really dig early on when I got into metalcore (and I still think they're pretty decent, unlike most of the metalcore stuff I used to listen to)\u000a\u000aEDIT: August Burns Red's White Washed works well too (alliteration intended)
p684
asVWhat song is this?
p685
(lp686
VIt's Cryromancer by Defiler
p687
aVNo, very similar though!

aVThink I found it.\u000a\u000a[Heart of a Coward - Shade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw8VXmbBbxM)\u000a\u000aEdit - Really similar breakdown, but not it : /

VThis might be the best song YOU've ever done. \u000a\u000aAnd I've heard People Under the Stairs.\u000a\u000aEdit - Had no idea Spencer was the one to post this... Excellent work! This is my jam right now.
p693
aVI agree, definitely in my top 3 of all their songs. Hope the upcoming record sounds similar. 
p694
aVAgree, definitely their best one yet(IMO anyways). The song just flows so well it's incredible.
p695
aVI got confused as to why you gave credit to OP.\u000aIt makes sense now.
p696
aVWho did this lyric video? I do lyric videos also, and wow this was amazing! 
p697
aVZW Multimedia, showed at the very end of the vid.
p698
aVI can't get enough of this song. It's INKcredible! The lyrics are well written and the vocals and instruments are beyond top notch. I probably sound like a raging fanboy, but I feel no shame. IX. \u005cm/
p699
aVGreat song, Spencer. You guys keep killing it!
p700
aVThis song really has the potential to take them to the next level(in terms of number of fans). I've listened to it a lot the last two days and it could be one of their best to date. 
p701
aVHoly fuck
p702
aVdude exactly\u000a\u000a
p703
aVwell done!
p704
aVHaven't really given INK a chance before. I am very impressed with this, the chorus is catchy as hell, great use of orchestral pieces and well done vocals. consider me a new fan. Any other songs/albums i should check out?
p705
aVJust listen straight through The Predator Becomes the Prey.
p706
aVYou should just check out everything by them but here's my top 5:\u000a\u000aThe Greatest Story Ever Told\u000a\u000aConnect the Cuts\u000a\u000aPeople Under the Stairs\u000a\u000aLet's Bury the Hatchet....In Your Head\u000a\u000aBuild Your Own Disaster\u000a\u000aTheir Adele cover and all of their acoustic stuff is amazing as well.
p707
aV"Greatest Story" is one they don't do live, and I do NOT KNOW WHY
p708
aVI feel your pain caught them live 3 times I just wanna hear once then I can die a happy man.
p709
aVWhy can't all lyrics videos be this good..
p710
aVIt's been a while since a song gave me goosebumps, awesome work!
p711
aVThis has instantly become my favorite song from you guys.  Just from this, I can tell your next album will be incredible, and will take you to the next level!
p712
aVGreat flair dude. Also yeah this album is gonna be great if the whole thing is gonna be like this song. 
p713
aVHell yeah dude, gotta represent 'Ments!

asVLigeia - Bombshell

sVBring Me The Horizon - Don't Go (feat. Lights)
p717
(lp718
VThis was my "See? I can be HxC *and* vulnerable *at the same time*!" song back in freshman year, lol
p719
aVHey, did you know Josh Scogin appeared on this song, \u000a[The Fox and the Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDvP8LGEHk)
p720
aVFucking love lights. This song used to really trigger emotions for me. 
p721
aVYeah this song reminds me of this summer when I was really sick and depressed. Right now I'm feeling so many emotions, especially when Lights is singing...
p722
aVI always thought this was one if their better songs, it's a stand out perfornance from Oli too.\u000a\u000aAlso LIGHTS.
p723
aVThis song is emo as fuck and i fucking love it. 
p724
aVSounds like he's singing after biting his tongue.
p725
aVNo thats the other song 
p726
aVi think thats his lisp...
p727
aVOne if my favorite BMTH tracks. It sounds so great and the lyrics are fucked up\u000a
p728
aVThe live video of them doing this live is do amazing... 
p729
aVALL THESE FEELS MAN\u000a
p730
aVUgh. Right in the feels. \u000a\u000aRough night. /:
p731
aVthis song brings back some memory's I forgot I even had.
p732
aVThese sort of songs are my favorite.  This song in particular is really good at stirring up emotion.  I haven't really been a big fan of Oli's change in style over the years, but it works here.  The screaming really adds to the struggle in the lyrics in it for me.
p733
aVI think Lights is great in this song. She's a great vocalist overall, but she really does make this song even better. Funny though, since at the time, a female singing part would've never been expected in a BMTH song..
p734
asVI See Stars - Boris The Animal
p735
(lp736
VLove these guys, Digital Renegade and New Demons are outstanding.
p737
aVMan, saw them live in December, that was the most mesmerizing experience I've ever had.  I had saw them previously and paid no mind to them or they had technical difficulties.  But that time was just **perfect.**  Especially during the "I'll jump!  Until my legs give in!" part in Judith Rules.  \u000a\u000aI do wish they played this song live.
p738
aVTheir New Demons Remix album is coming out Tuesday! So stoked.
p739
aVThe first few Metalcore albums I've listened to. Love it to death.
p740
aVI'd say it's a good album for beginners considering the shit I started off on.  I've been jamming these guys since 3-D, and they've only gotten better and better with each release. 
p741
aVI started from ND, and worked my way to their older albums. All their albums have a unique sound &amp; style to it which i love. And yes, they do get better with every album. They've gone a long way.
p742
aVthe end of the world party wasn't as good as 3D in my opinion
p743
aVI would have to agree.  The only reason I didn't say anything was because it's still a damn good album for the circumstances they were under when they put it out.  What with Zach leaving the band prior to its recording and coming back I'm guessing during the time they were in the studio. 
p744

VNaysayer by the Architects, the line "so sick of the sound of people giving up!" is incredible and I would love to have it be mine. 
p752
aV*YOU CAN'T STOP ME GIVING A FUCK!* **BLEGH!!**
p753
aVI love 'you had it all, you fucking pigs'
p754
aVThat's actually the song that got me into them too!
p755
aVI love the chorus for Naysayer. I can't explain exactly what it is, but it's kind of like the chorus of Vices Like Vipers by Oh Sleeper.
p756
aVTDWP - Danger Wildman\u000a\u000aEmpire - ABR 
p757
aVoh yeah or Danger: Wildman that'd be cool too
p758
aVAny Spongecore song.
p759
aVNo, this is PATRICK!!!
p760
aVHave you heard the single they released for their upcoming album?
p761
aVNot the American Average - Asking Alexandria
p762
aVThey would make you sing Someone, Somewhere.
p763
aVYou have to dress up like a cowboy and do your best David Lee Roth impression while hammered drunk. Still think you could do it?
p764
aVADTR - Heartless or I'm Made of Wax Larry, What Are You Made Of?
p765
aVDoing a back-and-forth with Jeremy during the ["everybody's out to get me" part](http://youtu.be/xaKdRwCveEc?t=1m39s) would be the most legit thing ever. 
p766
aVI never realized how much I want to do this until now.
p767
aVI would totally want to do Since U Been Gone.
p768
aVTrivium - Down From The Sky
p769
aVSurvival (The Chariot) by In Hearts Wake\u000a\u000aThrowing down to that breakdown on stage would be insane\u000a\u000a"MOTHERFUCKIN BOUNCE"
p770
aV*Killing Frenzy*
p771
aVI totally forgot about Survival. Every time it hits the breakdown I go insane.
p772
aVDefinitely OMAM - The Depths, the intro scream + blegh would make me lose my shit live
p773
aVDidn't even think of that. But 100% yes.
p774
aVERRA - Seven or TDWP - Dez Moines\u000a\u000aShit would be cash
p775
aV&gt; Shit would be Jesse Cash\u000a\u000aFTFY
p776
aVI would definitely do Dez Moines haha but ive never listened to ERRA.....maybe i should get on that.
p777
aVDez Moines is definitely a good song to scream.
p778
aVWas the first song I ever learned to scream (even though I had no idea what I was doing) and the entire reason I got into Metalcore. 
p779
aVThat's the song that got me into TDWP. I was blown away the first time I heard it.
p780
aVYou should defiantly check out ERRA, Seven is such an aggressive song and then you have other songs like Dementia or Pattern Interrupt which are just beautiful. Their album 'Augment' is one of my favorites, also the new EP is really good.
p781
aVI've heard ERRA a few times. Really liking them too.
p782
aVParkway Drive - Romance Is Dead
p783
aVSo cry me a FUCKIN river BITCH
p784
aVStuff that I could probably do, would be  Code Orange - My World as I get that final part down, or Converge - Concubine.\u000a\u000aThough if it doesn't matter on skill level, singing Said the king to the river with La Dispute or the last lost continent haha
p785
aVI don't think there are many people who can sing La Dispute without sounding awful other than Jordan, honestly.
p786
aVI don't think anyone can sing La Dispute without sounding awful, Jordan included.
p787
aV/r/AntiLaDisputeWatch, also happy cake day

aVTASTE THE BLOOD OF YOUR BROTHERS
p804
aVSo intense!
p805
aVAugust Burns Red - Provision
p806
aVI'd wanna do back burner. Just to come out during the breakdown at the end. "I hope, you survive...survive the crashhhhhhh!" Then jump around with them. Best possible 30 seconds of my life if that happened....
p807
aVThat would definitely be fun too

aVfuuuuck, i don't think i can choose. \u000a\u000amaybe, The Word Alive - Life Cycles\u000a\u000aOr one of their other songs, like 2012, Entirety, or The Wretched.
p815
aVArchitects - gravedigger 
p816
aVStructures- Earth Gazingthay would be dope to sing along with the band members. Also side note, I can't wait for Vol/tures
p817
aVJohnny's Rebellion by Crown The Empire or Ten Thousand Feet by I See Stars. God, those would be so fun...
p818
aVThe Devil Wears Prada - Lord Xenu\u000a\u000aNot necessarily my favourite TDWP song, but that song is so much fun to scream along to.
p819
aVThat entire album is awesome to scream along too. Sometimes I'll just put on the CD and sing a long to the whole thing. Except for this week when I hurt my throat trying to do it because I'm sick. Don't scream while sick man. PSA.

p829
aVEvelyn by Volbeat
p830
aVNice, but you're cheating, Volbeat definitely isn't metalcore :)
p831
aVTrue but it's what I feel like I can sing. Haha
p832
aVI would do any vocals for Dance Gavin Dance\u000abut as a specific song (and more along the lines of metalcore), id do Floorboards by Oceans Ate Alaska
p833

p834
aVWe Came As Romans- To Move On is to Grow
p835
aVADTR - Pretty much any song that has a one line breakdown.\u000a\u000aBTF - Any song really, but To Hell and Back would be sick.\u000a\u000aA7x - Chapter Four, Second Heartbeat, Unholy Confessions\u000a\u000aWould also be ok performing with Linkin Park if were playing songs from HT/Meteora
p836
aVHoly Diver with Killswitch Engage or Ghost In The Mirror with Memphis May Fire. 
p837
aVBring Me The Horizon - Crucify Me. I'd love to scream "i am the ocean, I am the sea. There is a world inside of me." \u000aOr A Day To Remember - The Plot To Bomb The Panhandle for the "I'll rip that scandalous bitch in two"
p838
aVKinda cheating because the aren't metalcore, but probably The Words "Best Friend" become Redefined by Chiodos.\u000a\u000aIf that doesn't count, Carrion by Parkway Drive for sure.
p839
aV"Crow Killer" ~ Unearth\u000a\u000aThat songs gets me going. I was listening to that album, especially that song, over and over right around the time when we got Bin Laden. It was epic, because the song lines up beautifully with that event.

VWould also like to know. Also how does the compression work? I hear it makes it sound better.
p860
aVFor a microphone, I'd recommend the Shure SM7B and software wise I would definitely recommend [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/). I absolutely LOVE that program.
p861
aVIt all depends on your budget. How much will you pay for a good mic and software?\u000a\u000aFor starters, i think the easiest way you could go about it is with a Shure SM57 microphone. And the simple software Audacity. The SM57 is all right for recording vocals! It can record other instruments too. You're probably going to need a soundcard, i don't know much about soundcards. But i have the [Lexicon Alpha] (http://lexiconpro.com/en/products/alpha) and it does me justice.\u000a\u000aThat is probably the easiest kit you could go with. But if you want something even better then you have to get something a bit more pricey.

aVI know what you mean I always listen to metal when I am working
p1017
aVIt's all shits and giggles until your boss gets mad at you for trying to start a moshpit in the employee break room. Break room breakdown?
p1018
aVI like the demo version of this song a lot better. This one just seems less energetic and less raw
p1019
aVnever heard it
p1020
aVIt's basically the same song, except faster paced, which makes it about a minute shorter
p1021
aVYep. And a lot more drum fills and the guitar solo has less unnecessary notes\u000a\u000aEdit: Lmao at the salty A7X fanboys downvoting me because I don't worship the ground that an immensely overrated guitarist walks on
p1022
aVMy friend, there is no such thing as "unnecessary notes" when syn solos.
p1023
aVDon't get me wrong, I think Syn is a fairly talented guitarist, but you can definitely tell that he added in random phrases in the beginning of the guitar solo just for the sake of adding random phrases in a guitar solo. The solo in the demo just fits more imo
p1024
aVfairly talented?
p1025
aVWhen guitarists like Luke Hoskin, Paul Waggoner, Tosin Abasi, Jason Richardson, Misha Mansoor, and John Petrucci exist, it's pretty hard to say Syn is anything more than "fairly talented." Obviously if you think otherwise, to each their own
p1026
aVAj Minette, David Davidson, Sithu Aye, Christian Mnzner, Yngwie Malmsteen, the list goes on
p1027
aVTo be fair, many of those guitarists strive to make technically impressive riffs/songs. The members of A7x don't give two shits about making technically impressive material. They only care about the songwriting. The only time Syn may actually try to show off any sort of technicality is during the solos, and even then its to compliment the song, not show off his technical skill
p1028
aVIt's not like bands like Between the Buried and Me, Protest the Hero, Periphery, and Dream Theater totally focus on guitar wankery and completely throw any sense of songwriting out the window. If you want to hear technically impressive guitar work that's complete devoid of original songwriting, try something like Dragonforce. If you want to hear impressive songwriting that's accompanied by technically impressive guitar work, try Skies by Protest the Hero, Luck as a Constant by Periphery, basically anything by BTBAM (I personally love Prequel to the Sequel, but any song of theirs will prove my point), anything by Animals as Leaders, or Octavarium by Dream Theater. All of those bands put A7X to shame in literally every conceivable aspect.\u000a\u000aI'm not attacking you or telling you your opinion is invalid. Just want to justify what I said in my other comment, that's all :)
p1029
aVOh don't get me wrong, I think all of those bands make great songs. I was just pointing out that A7x, with the exception of a few solos or drum fills, has never been a band that is interested in being all that technical, even though they are more than capable of being so. I don't mean to downplay any of the other bands, I just felt the need to point out that all of the members of A7x are far more technically skilled than they let on.\u000a\u000aAnd same to you :)
p1030
aVI like them both, and considering I find Syn to have better phrasing than pretty much any other guitarist that is in a band, the more notes the better :p
p1031
aVI don't think syn is overrated but I don't think he is the best or worship the ground they walk on. I think he earns his place in my top 20
p1032
aVMy comment wasn't directed at you. Just the people who downvote me for having any sort of criticism towards a guitarist who is overrated in my opinion. Obviously if you like him then that's totally cool, like I said before, to each their own\u000a\u000aEdit: Huge mistake. I accidentally wrote "was" instead of "wasn't"
p1033
aVMan your comment is being misinterpreted and unfairly blown up.  I totally agree, you're spot on.  Longtime fan of A7X, the Demo is simply more raw, more energetic, less sterile--notably the vocals and solo, and it's got that punk/metal hybrid vibe which they had in their early stages.  Doesn't take away from the fact that this is a good song regardless
p1034
aVJust listened to this album in its entirety last night, this and City of Evil are my favorite A7X albums.
p1035
aVI listened to the whole thing today. I think this an Nightmare are the best

sVWhat was your Metalcore journey like?
p1041
(lp1042
VUnderoath lead to Norma Jean which lead to Haste the Day which lead to The Devil Wears Prada which lead to August Burns Red.\u000a\u000aThen I went through a genericore phase with Attack Attack!, Asking Alexandria, etc.\u000a\u000aI dig more riff oriented stuff now, but every now and then a breakdown fest is fun.
p1043
aVIt was weird for me, I got into metal core when a friend showed me barbarian by Abr back in like 06 then I got into miss may i/AA/Om&amp;M\u000a\u000aThen I got over that and got into like The plot in you, upon a burning body and now \u000a\u000aI'm more into TesseracT/Periphery/Animals As leaders/the contortionist. 
p1044
aVYeah I kinda had the same path OP. I got into metalcore through TDWP, As I Lay Dying, Atreyu, Bullet For My Valentine, August Burns Red in the late 2000s. As I got older I got into heavier, and heavier stuff.. Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Acacia Strain, Chelsea Grin. But now I am getting into more and more melodic/djenty stuff. ERRA, Periphery, Northlane, Animals as Leaders, TesseracT, Invent, Animate...\u000a\u000aI just love this genre, I have always loved it and I have never strayed from it once.
p1045
aVNow that I think about it, I would say my path parallels yours more. I got heavier and heavier and then I can say that I have also fallen into the more melodic stuff. It's almost like I've lived a full life and retired into easier going melodicore. \u000a\u000aAlso, it's funny that you mention Invent, Animate. I went to school with all of the members and they are some rad dudes without a doubt. 
p1046
aVThat's awesome!! Everything they've written and put out I have found incredible. They should be huge, I really like that band.

p1050
aVSlipknot lead me to Killswitch Engage, into All That Remains, onto As I Lay Dying, and then around '07 into deathcore bands like Suicide Silence, Born of Osiris, All Shall Perish, Veil of Maya, and Whitechapel, now I pretty much check out anything and everything I can that might interest me
p1051
aVLike a lot of others I'm sure, my first metalcore band was Bullet For My Valentine. I remember hearing the band name, knwoing nothing about them, googling them, listening to Tears Don't Fall and I was fucking hooked. That was probably 6th or 7th grade (I'm a freshman in college now). From there it just kind of grew like the heads on a hydra, Bring Me the Horizon, Sleeping with Sirens, Slipknot, Avenged Sevenfold, Alesana, etc. just came pouring in to my music library. \u000a\u000aMy only real "phase" was between 8th grade and 9th grade, I was moving away from post hardcore and metalcore and was really into deathcore, death metal and slam death metal. I think 30% of that was trying to be that scary goth kid for my freshman year of high school (I was).\u000a\u000aBut I mean, I still listen to Bullet, Sleeping with Sirens, and all those other bands, while continuing to find new bands all the time.
p1052
aVI'm also a freshman in college and it's funny you mention BFMV. The reason I got into to ANY heavy music was purely because for some reason they showed the video for Scream, Aim, Fire on MTV (weird, I know). I'm glad they did because it totally pulled me away from the MTV shit they play on the radio nowadays.
p1053
aVMan this is so weird to think about. I think I started listening to The Amity Affliction, because they're from the same city as me. They were all I listened to for a solid year (which is fucked because this was back when they only had 2 EP's). Then I got into pretty much any other heavy Australian band, like Parkway, IKTPQ, Carpathian, House vs. Hurricane, The Red Shore etc. The only non-Australian band I liked at that point was BMTH, because they played on IKTPQ's farewell tour. \u000a\u000aThen Parkway Drive brought Suicide Silence out on tour when I was like 15 and their performance blew my mind so I started to listen to a lot more American stuff (All That Remains, ADTR, The Plot in You, The Ghost Inside). At this point I also started to listen to more European stuff as well, but there weren't too many bands I liked from Europe. \u000a\u000aAnd now I'm kind of back to listening to pretty much only Australian bands (Northlane, IKTPQ, 50 Lions, Thy Art is Murder, Violent Soho, Hand of Mercy) because in my opinion a lot (not all though) American bands try to copy each other's sounds too much. So I guess my journey went by geography, not really genres. 
p1054
aVThat's definitely interesting! And I agree with you concerning the similarity between American bands. It's the reason why I mainly listen to EU/UK stuff.
p1055
aVThroatruiner put out some amazing stuff and the church of Ra is great too.
p1056
aVMy favourite Aussie band would be idylls, they are sick 
p1057
aVWhen it comes to the start of my "Metalcore Journey", there are actually a few specific songs that seemed to have played a pretty big role.\u000a\u000aIt all started around 2007/2008 hearing songs like Waking The Demon by Bullet For My Valentine. Then listening to bands As I Lay Dying and Bring Me The Horizon. I still remember thinking that 'Through Struggle' and 'Pray For Plagues' was the heaviest thing I ever heard back then. Sometime later me and my friends would discover a band named Miss May I when they first released their demo in 2008. I remember hearing No Need To Whip A Dead Horse( the song now known as Porcelain Wings) and thinking that breakdown was one of the craziest things ever.\u000a\u000aThen sometime later A Day To Remember released Homesick in 2009. I was just sitting in class and heard this one girl talking about a band named A Day To Remember. Didn't think much of it but still decided to check them out once I got home that day. I wish I could remember the first song I heard by them but I believe it was Fast Forward to 2012. I immediately fell in love with the band and just sat their listening to their whole discography over and over again,especially For Those Who Have Heart.\u000a\u000aAfter that I just discovered more and more bands. August Burns Red, We Came As Romans, Parkway Drive,Texas In July, The Devil Wears Prada and more.\u000a\u000aIn 2011 I went to my first Metalcore show and I just fell more and more in love with metal/death/hard. Going to all kinds of shows,discovering more bands.\u000a\u000aThinking back over those early years kind of makes me miss the times when bands had  long and nonsensical names like "Who Speaks Spanish,Colon Quesadilla,HTML Rulez D00d,Things That Rhyme With Orange. Also when bands had neon colored merch,with all kinds of crazy designs on them.
p1058
aVConverge &gt; oathbreaker &gt; every time I die &gt; the Dillinger escape plan &gt; gaza/cult leader  (these two not as much) &gt; possibly old underoath\u000a\u000aThese is my metalcore route , I listen to other bands in the genre just not as much as these bands or just singles from them, my metalcore route kinda went softer I guess but at the same time in other genres I've gone heavier.\u000a\u000aEdit: I just realised the first metalcore song I heard was hand of blood by bfmv but it didn't lead to anything as I was younger, it was in a video game. Botch before every time I die
p1059
aVWhen I was in 5th grade, my friend introduced me to Linkin Park. Another friend recommended Breaking Benjamin and Simple Plan. I loved, and still love, these bands. Then one day I heard a Saosin song (I think it was "Finding Home" from their self-titled album) and the style sounded a little like Simple Plan's, only heavier and more technical. I looked into Saosin's old stuff and found myself highly enjoying "Seven Years" and "They Perched On Their Stilts" cause of how aggressive and raw the style was. \u000a\u000aI then chanced upon a news article about a psycho who kidnapped a girl by posing as Oli Sykes. This got me interested in BMTH so I started listening to their album There Is A Heaven and loved it. One of my classmates then told me to listen to Chthonic (black/death metal band from my native country, Taiwan) and on a search for similar songs I found Erra's album Impulse.

aVRob zombie/slipknot into demon hunter, into oh sleeper, into august burns red. 
p1061
aVInteresting...
p1062
aVsome scene girl i used to know sent me the link to stick stickly and i haven't looked back since lol
p1063
aVIt's kind of fuzzy but the bands I started out with were, Underoath, Norma Jean, Haste The Day and ABR with their demo and EP.
p1064
aVI started out by pretty much listening to almost every band on the 2012 Warped tour, since that was pretty much my introduction to this sort of music, before slowly getting more focused on the things I like, first Blessthefall, then Of Mice &amp; Men (back when they weren't terrible), then finally August Burns Red, who's been my favorite band since then, though the other bands I listen to continue to change a lot, right now I'm really into a lot of atmospheric/progressive stuff 
p1065
aVI started out listening to Alesana and discovered Asking Alexandria through one of the songs featuring the clean vocalist. After that, I started listening to OM&amp;M and MMF through the Flood and the Hollow. \u000a\u000aAfter a while, I started listening to a lot of Jimmy Buffett and found more bands through Pandora - TDWP and Norma Jean. Since then, I've discovered more metalcore through Pandora and Spotify and then this subreddit, which opened a whole new world of metalcore for me. \u000a\u000aTo this day, Jimmy Buffett is still one of my favorite artists.
p1066
aVI started with Black Veil Brides/Asking Alexandria/Sleeping with Sirens about 4 years ago.  Today I listen to a lot of ERRA/Volumes among many other things.  But yea it seems my tastes get heavier as time progresses, although I still do appreciate the music that got me here in the first place.  It's kind of funny to go through my "Purchased" playlist in my iTunes and if I play it in order I can listen to how my music tastes have developed over the years.
p1067
aVI started with [this fan song for a show I liked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9374Se3Ka0) at the time (this was mid 2013) and saw anthony fantano's review of Sempiternal which got me interested in the genre. I couldn't get into it at first, but the vocal glitches in Can You Feel My Heart kept me coming back and I eventually fell in love with The House of Wolves. After that I went to 4chan's music board and asked for some "pussy" metalcore rec's and people there told me to check out Misery Signals, Johnny Truant, Protest the Hero, Every Time I Die, He is Legend, Killswitch Engage, and Miss May I. The only one of these that really clicked right away was Every Time I Die, the song in particular they showed me was [Pigs is Pigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6OXX2vcaZU). I ended up checking out hot topic's "screamo" and "metal" sections for stuff and got into Capture the Crown and Woe is Me, and because of a piece of fan art for the the same show I mentioned earlier I found Of Mice &amp; Men. And I mostly stuck with OM&amp;M, Woe is Me, CtC, BMTH, and Protest the Hero for a while until I found this sub. \u000a\u000aAnd late 2013 I tried to burn through as many metalcore albums as I could and ended up listening to ~100 of them. A couple in particular stuck, namely [Ends With a Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-_8nNnxWEQ), [RooM](https://roommetal.bandcamp.com/track/when-all-is-said-and-done), We Came as Romans, and blessthefall. \u000a\u000aAfter that I went on a short lived trancecore tangent and listened to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Greta Knights, Adam Kills Eve, and The Bunny the Bear. \u000a\u000aOnce 2014 started I decided to get into deathcore, but not much clicked. But I heard Carnifex had a new album coming so I decided to marathon their stuff (I had only heard Hell Chose Me at that point) and The Diseased and the Poisoned really clicked, which opened up the metal side of the genre. \u000a\u000aI decided to give the more popular bands a listen again after about 6 or 7 months into last year trying to discover better stuff in the "underground" and had both Killswitch and AILD blow me away. Which has been leading me into melodeath. \u000a\u000aI still enjoy some of the stuff I listened to at first, like OM&amp;M, WCAR, BMTh, and blessthefall. \u000a\u000aEarlier on when I was first into metalcore, and first found out what breakdowns were I despised them. They've grown on me a bit since then. I still don't like them like most people here seem to, but I don't find myself disgusted by them either. 
p1068
aVI can't believe you asked for pussy metalcore and that they gave you every time I die.
p1069
aVOne guy offered me deathcore.\u000a\u000aThe closest thing to "pussy" metalcore any of them gave me was Miss May I (the album At Heart specifically) and someone said Misery Signals was the best "pussy" metalcore there was. \u000a\u000aI'm kind of glad though, because by "pussy" metalcore I think I meant post hardcore. 
p1070
aVWell you are here now, that's the important thing haha able to partake on /r/metalcore 
p1071
aVYep. This sub is why I stuck around on reddit.
p1072
aVSame but I also discuss on /r/metal  /r/hardcore /r/posthardcore and occasionally /r/letstalkmusic all good places if like those genres or stuff similar.
p1073
aVI use other subs as well, namely /r/lewronggeneration /r/tumblrinaction and /r/metal. 
p1074
aVI'm subbed to le wrong generation its pretty funny just I'm to scared to comment as I know I will say something stupid haha
p1075
aVI used to listen to Sepultura, Pantera, Metallica, etc. Then in 2009 I discovered Bullet For My Valentine, which was the band that introduced me into metalcore, so I started listening to the popular bands at that time (BMTH, AA, AA!). Got bored, discovered August Burns Red and Parkway Drive, because of Parkway I would listen more to hardcore bands than metalcore. Northlane's Singularity came out and I loved the sound. Because of Northlane's sound and my undying love for Misery Signals, I was introduced to bands that I listen to a lot lately, like The Contortionist, Animals as Leaders, Volumes and stuff. I can see a progression in my musical taste, and I'm stoked to know what I'm going to listen in the future.

Sianvar is really tickling my fancy right now. Ive been going towards bands with technical instruments and less screaming.
p1077
aVAsking alexandrias stepped up and scratched from when I used to listen to more electro stuff years ago, then AAs other albums. Then a few sleeping with sirens, escape the fate and attack attack before finding parkway drive, breakdown of sanity and bury tomorrow which I've loved since and expanded out to more melodeath stuff like amon amarth. 
p1078
aVLinkin Park-Breaking Benjamin-Avenged Sevenfold-Killswitch Engage-All That Remains-As I Lay Dying-Of Mice and Men-Volumes\u000a\u000aOnce I started listening to AILD, I was pretty set in my heavy ways and started listening to a lot of different metal/metalcore.  It's funny cause I used to hate screaming, it made me so uncomfortable. But I got used to it in the few songs I liked that had it, and eventually grew to like it.
p1079
aVFor me, it started with allll Christian stuff. Underoath led to some alt-rock "harder" Christian bands like Spoken, Disciple, Red, ect. Underoath was as heavy as it got for a time (mostly 6-7th grade), then my friend bought me Demon Hunter's "Storm the Gates of Hell" and I was like "br00tal". This led to more DH, AILD, The Devil Wears Prada, For Today, August Burns Red, Norma Jean, ect. Growing up in Des Moines, I then started getting a Slipknot phase, and I sorta expanded out of the Christian music scene. I then started listening to "scene-y" bands like Alesana, WCAR &amp; Attack Attack. That was all in 9th grade, and starting around my sophomore year I got really into the scene and started listening to some Deathcore and Hardcore too (The Ghost Inside, Chelsea Grin, Suicide Silence). And I've basically stayed stagnant there since then. The whole djent thing started and I obviously like some of those bands a lot (IHW, Northlane, Invent Animate, newer Periphery). I just found that as I got older I found myself in more "moods". When I was younger, it didn't matter what I was listening to, I just would spin whatever I wanted. Now, I'll be more like "I want some heavy as balls breakdowns" or "something softer" (I really enjoy pop-punk music too, like the wonder years, story so far, mayday parade ect). I'm a sophmore in college now, and my parents occasionally ask me if I still listen to the "screamy music". They thought it would just be a phase, but so far they've been wrong. 
p1080
aVUsed to despise anything resembling metalcore in high school. I listened to Audioslave, RATM, Foo Fighters, Saliva, stuff like that. While that music is still good, I find myself rarely revisiting. It just seems lacking in energy and a bit formulaic. \u000a\u000aMy first exposure was my freshman year in college. Living in my fraternity I had some friends convince me to listen to some new stuff. I thing it started with We Came As Romans, ADTR, AILD, ABR, and some others. I really enjoyed it now for some reason, not sure why I blocked all that out earlier. Now a senior in college, it is basically all I listen to along with the occasional EDM stuff.\u000a\u000aThose bands, and Spotify premium, really allowed me to explore the genre. I also like that the concerts are way easier to attend, cheaper, and more frequent in areas close to me.
p1081
aVI started listening to more and more music going into seventh grade. For the next couple years I never really had any particular genre I liked and I would just listen to whatever sounded good to me. I ended up stumbling upon Paramore, and that was the first band I got *really* into, then into the kind of alternative genre. Then my high school sweetheart at the time introduced me to Three Days Grace, her favorite song being Riot. Later I found Disturbed, then a bit of Slipknot. A friend of mine from New Mexico introduced me to Escape the Fate - Situations (seems like that's everyone's introduction song into EtF). Fast forward another couple years I'm dating a girl who listened to stuff like Sleeping with Sirens, Pierce the Veil, and a bit of Bring Me The Horizon, Asking Alexandria, Woe is Me, Of Mice &amp; Men. I ended up being more interested into the second bit of that list, mostly BMTH. Through them I kind of fell into the genre finding things from all flavors like Attack Attack! Get Scared, Crown the Empire, I See Stars!, Memphis May Fire, Miss May I, and Beartooth. 
p1082
aVI always listened to The Used and ADTR and randomly listened to Demon Hunter for a year my freshmen year of high school, but I went to see Hollywood Undead my senior year and they were playing with D.R.U.G.S., WCAR, Asking Alexandria, and Borgore (but that led me to my dubstep phase). I thought WCAR was okay, but loved D.R.U.G.S. and Asking Alexandria. \u000a\u000aSaw LMTF with D.R.U.G.S. later on and then delved super intense into genericore for warped tour that summer (MMF, started loving WCAR, etc.)\u000a\u000aIt's been about three years since then and I've been refining my taste ever since. I enjoy some genericore like Secrets and old MMF, but not too often. I dig the instrumentation and "chugga chugga, breakdown" doesn't do it for me anymore. Love me some ETID, Enter Shikari, Periphery, and Swancore these days, but I also love occasional pop music, reggae, indie, and just chiller stuff in general.\u000a\u000aTo put it candidly, I dig some bullshit music if I'm feeling lighthearted, but I always encourage real authentic music. Also, there needs to be some form of melody. I hate music that's just chugs and screams with nothing to attach to.
p1083
aVI used to listen to Nickelback, 3 Doors Down, 3 Days Grace, Papa Roach, Audioslave, Soundgarden until about 2011. I did enjoy songs like "Hand of Blood" by BFMV or "Nothing Left" by AILD since 2008 but I never really digged the genre at the time. So until mid-2011, I only listened BFMV and KSE in terms of Metalcore. \u000a\u000aIn 2012, I discovered and listen a lot to Asking Alexandria, blessthefall and Falling In Reverse.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, I took the first big step towards the love of Metalcore when I discovered Northlane, Novelists, OM&amp;M, TWA, MMF, Issues and a few others.\u000a\u000aBy mid-2014, I only listened to Metalcore after having discovered this subreddit and with it hundreds of bands (to name a few: TAA, Attila, BTM, Bury Tomorrow, TCM, ERRA, I See Stars, IHW, 'Invent, Animate', Misery Signals, Volumes). My interests also reached genres like Deathcore and Melodic Hardcore.\u000a\u000aDuring august 2014, I went to my first concert ever (at the age of 21), [saw ADTR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osEYVYKq0mA) and wanted more the second it ended. Since then, I also went to a concert featuring Asking Alexandria, Crown The Empire, TGI and Secrets then I went to see my favorite band Northlane (between the time I got the tickets and the actual concert Adrian had been replaced by Marcus) along with PWD, HSB and Carnifex.\u000a\u000aOver the years, my taste definitely got heavier and heavier. Years ago, I hardly enjoyed screaming and now I pay more attention to it than cleans. This music genre really helps me feel complete.
p1084
aVMan, most people here started with Bullet. I never got into them. I liked some of their songs but never really listened anything but the popular ones. \u000a\u000aMy dad listened to hard rock/metal, so I always liked it, but the band that got me into music was Breaking Benjamin. I remember playing Halo 2 as a kid and their song "Blow Me Away" starting up at the end of one of the levels. Got hooked. Started looking up other songs by them and then quickly became addicted. From their I moved onto other hard rock bands like Three Days Grace, Chevelle, newer A7X, etc. anything that had a little bit of screaming every once and awhile basically. \u000a\u000aThen, I heard "People = Shit" by Slipknot back in 2011. That song changed my life. I became hooked on Slipknot. They are the band that got me into full on screaming. From their my tastes started getting heavier. I started listening to Post-hardcore stuff like Escape the Fate and Falling in Reverse around summer 2012, and then I saw FIR around November of that year, so I guess that was my first show of the genre. (Enter Shikari and letlive. opened up) But I listened to Zombie EP by Prada a lot that summer too, even though I couldn't get into their other stuff for some reason at the time. So that was my first metalcore album I feel in love with. \u000a\u000aThen my first showed me I See Stars around Christmas. I was hooked on it. I saw them two months later in February, with a bunch of other metalcore bands. So that was my first real metalcore show, and then a few weeks later my friend invited me to go to this festival here in Texas called "South By So What?!" last minute. Figured what the hell. That day got me hooked on everything metalcore. I discovered Memphis May Fire, Bring me the Horizon, older prada stuff etc. from their my taste have just gotten more and more metalcore. \u000a\u000aI've been listening to a lot of Silent Planet, Architects, and Northlane recently. 
p1085
aVGreat story, man! Yeah, Northlane is actually my favorite band by FAR and I really have been listening to Architects a lot lately. LF:LT was such a great album. Also, I just discovered Silent Planet about a month ago and I have fallen in love with them. Christian or not, Garrett writes some great material. And yeah I actually live in Denton (around Dallas) so I'm familiar of South By So What. Might be going again this year.

I do it on my rack tom. \u000a\u000aI jam this song pretty regularly because it's really fun to play. I believe all of the notes up until after the kicks are triplet 32nd notes and then the remaining snares with the China included (and the rim hits the second time around) are 16th notes. take that with a grain of salt though because I'm not the best with notes and rudimentary stuff. anyways, hope this helps you out. cheers

VPauley has a hell of a voice but I'll be damned if it isn't the most boring, out of place dynamic in Of Mice.
p1114
aVI agree, in Jamie's Elsewhere he was the reason why I fell in love with them. When I hears he was joining OMM I was so excited. Then, I heard them music. Although, it's not the worst music I've heard it is a damn shame that he couldn't do better for some unknown reason.

aVI would disagree 
p1117
aVOk.
p1118
aVWell that was very civil.
p1119
aVNo point in arguing against an opinion. He wasn't a dick to me, I'll respond accordingly. 
p1120
aVNo I mean that's great haha. It's very rare to see on reddit. 
p1121
aVThere doesn't need to be an argument in every thread haha. 
p1122
aVWhich is wonderful. Have a great rest of your Thursday!
p1123
aVMy Thursday has pretty much ended, because I live in the UK. I return the sentiment, though!
p1124
aVWhat's up with the hate for OM&amp;M in the Genre?? Legit question as I don't get it. My guess would be that their lyrics are a bit empty. But is that reason enough ?!
p1125
aVThe new style is the complete opposite of why everyone loved them. It's mainly Austin and how he doesn't do the screams how he used to. \u000a\u000aHe used to sound so powerful and full of energy. Now it feels like he's sorta saying things while gritting his teeth.
p1126
aVI have no problem with their self-titled and The Flood.\u000a\u000a[Restoring Force is a different story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/2mnwzb/worst_album_of_2014/cm6bp3d)
p1127
aVJacky Vincent from Falling In Reverse is so unbelievably talented to be in such a bad band.\u000a\u000aPierce The Veil definitely has some chops, it's just their fanbase is kind of a huge turn off. Plus the lyrics are a little too cheesy for me.\u000a\u000aBring Me The Horizon are ridiculously talented, but like PTV, their fanbase is annoying. Plus they'll never put out anything as good as Suicide Season again.\u000a\u000aI can definitely respect Beartooth musically, but Caleb Shomo is such a tool that I can't get past his hammed up vocals and lyrics.\u000a\u000aSworn In has awesome instrumentation as well but oh my god if they release another "blackness in my head, shoot me fucking dead" song lyrically, I might actually kill Tyler Dennen.
p1128
aV1. "they'll never put out anything as good as Suicide Season again" is the most true statement i will read today. \u000a2. totally true with PTV too. some of those guys have been acquaintances of mine and they're more talented than the music they play... and the fan base sucks...
p1129
aVWell this about sums up what I was gonna post. Jacky Vincent could probably bring some insane skill to a metalcore band. 
p1130
aVI was really into Sworn In when I found out about them...till I saw them live. The singer is just on a whole other level of weird, and just an overall underwhelming performance from the band as a whole. Maybe it was just that day, but definitely not digging them as much anymore.
p1131
aVI don't mean this in a sassy way at all, but can you explain why Caleb Shomo is a tool?
p1132
aVAMA
p1133
aVThat's what I was referring to. 
p1134
aVI just searched and read through it. What makes him a tool?
p1135
aVBecause he just has a very phony aura to him. Everything he did in Attack Attack! up until now in Beartooth just seems fake, or non-genuine. Plus there's the AMA fiasco...
p1136
aVDo you think that he was actually involved in the AMA? I'm I sure what the whole deal with aa is, as I wasn't involved in metalcore yet. I have met him at warped and he seemed nice enough, but the other band members were a lot cooler. The only thing that bugs me about him is how he made the entire disgusting album, I feel like it would've been a lot better if he had the other members with him. Clearly he's talented, but ya know, it could've been a better album. 
p1137
aV&gt;Do you think that he was actually involved in the AMA?\u000a\u000aI think that anyone who doesn't likely falls under a subcategory of people who believe the word gullible is not in the dictionary.
p1138
aVLol gotcha. The account used was deleted afterwards too. It also seemed pretty genuine too, like answers that were pretty believable. 
p1139
aVA lot of mathcore, not really a fan of the music, but I really respect the talent these bands have
p1140
aVAgreed. I dig bands like TDEP, Secret Band, and Converge(?), but can't get into anything else from the genre. Mathcore is super talented, though.
p1141
aVHow hard did you try to get in? As if you like those three bands there's plenty of similar stuff out there.
p1142
aVI tried pretty hard. It's mainly the vocalists that got me into the bands (IE - Secret Band)
p1143
aVQuite often its just the random music but there's quite a bit with similar vocals, like a fair a bit that has the "screamo" style.
p1144
aVBa ba ba blasphemy 
p1145
aVJust not really my thing
p1146
aVAugust Burns Red, For Today, The Dillinger Escape Plan\u000a\u000aJust could never get into them, but you can see the talent. 
p1147
aVDitto on The Dillinger Escape Plan. They're incredibly talented dudes but their music can be kinda hard to listen to. It's just all over the place.
p1148
aVThey ooze talent. 
p1149
aVDefinitely feel you on abr. I know they're amazing musicians, but I just can't get into them for some reason. And It really sucks, because guitar tabs of their songs can get insane.
p1150
aVI can't stand Bring Me The Horizon after TIAHBMISI, but damn. I have to give him credit. His vocals are not easy to do, and can be very dangerous. Not to mention, the instrumentalists are damn talented as well. 
p1151
aVyou might be first other person I've ever stumbled across that also really appreciates their instrumentation. I PARTICULARLY like BMTH's instrumentation, especially from their early work (though I controversially DON'T like their early work vocal-wise)
p1152
aVI've always appreciated them. They keep showing they're able to experiment and try new things. 
p1153
aVI honestly really love their newest CD's instrumentals a -lot- but the songs themselves are just 'okay'. Hopefully i'm not the only one.
p1154
aVthey got really weird and artsy on this new one's instrumentation. With the exception of Sempiternal and House Of Wolves, which are just straight-forward metalcore songs, the rest of them have really experimental bits and pieces (i.e. Can You Feel My Heart)
p1155
aVConverge. I tried to listen to them a few times, but their music really turns me off. However, they were a huge influence on several other bands I really like, so I can definitely respect that. Plus, almost any band thats been around for that long, has been doing something right.
p1156
aVI don't care for anything TDWP have put out since Plagues, but I can admit they've definitely matured and haven't put out anything that's truly bad. \u000a\u000aI don't like Bullet for my Valentine, but I do appreciate them helping the genre become more popular. I'd probably have never heard of it otherwise. \u000a\u000aI don't like Miss May I, but they do their style well. \u000a\u000aI don't like Affiance, but their vocals are fantastic. \u000a\u000a
p1157
aVAffiance's guitar work is fantastic as well
p1158
aVI haven't listened to Blackout in a while, so I don't really remember the guitarwork. 
p1159
aVI haven't really listened to the new one too much, but The Campaign and No Secrets Reveled are great. NSR has a bit more chugging though 
p1160
aVYeah, it was the chugging that really turned me off of Blackout. With the production it almost reminded me of older Asking Alexandria. \u000a\u000a
p1161
aVI agree to a point on this, it's not totally original music at all. But those vocals are outrageously good so I think it makss it worth it.
p1162
aVIf you like them give the band [Mutiny Within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOIEPrroqsg) a shot.
p1163
aVWell i've got some new music for work tonight, thank you! 
p1164
aVErra. I could probably be the only one in this subreddit who doesn't like them, but I recognise that those guys are talented musicians.
p1165
aVI am the same, I loathe his cleans and when I saw them live it made me okay with my decision to not like his cleans 
p1166
aVSaw them on the Frozen Flame tour a couple weeks back (had been a fan of them/seen them live before). His cleans really turned me off of hearing them. He can't hit the notes that he tried for on this new album. 
p1167
aVI like Erra a lot in theory. I like all of the things they do with their music, but something about it just puts me off. 
p1168
aVAugust Burns Red. They're talented guys, and are one of the big names in the genre, but I really can't get into their stuff. All of it sounds too similar to me.
p1169
aVI give mad credit to their drummer Matt Greiner because he's amazingly talented. But I just cannot get into ABR no matter how hard I try 
p1170
aVI don't like the band YAITW as people and attitudes but I respect and enjoy their music,is this cheating?\u000a\u000aOr I respect DGD's music and singing but I really dislike the singing, as you could guess I enjoy the secret band a lot.
p1171
aV&gt;YAITW\u000a\u000a\u000aWho?
p1172
aVYoung and In The Way a blackened crust band signed to deathwish inc
p1173
aVChris Fronzak isn't that great to me, but as a person he's such a nice dude. 
p1174
aVFor me I want to say it's Protest the Hero. I just don't like the vocals in that band. They have some songs I really enjoy but for the most part I just have never gotten into it.
p1175
aVTrivium. I've gotten to like a few of songs by them, but not a huge fan overall. But goddamn they are masters of their craft.
p1176
aVJoshua Travis is an amazing guitarist, but every project he's in sounds exactly the same and they're all boring as shit. breakdowns are fun, but not when its breakdown into breakdown into breakdown into breakdown etc. 
p1177
aVYou find Danza boring?!
p1178
aVoh yeah totally. Every song is the same thing over and over and over. there are technical bands that are WAY better than that. Danza is just ALL breakdowns. that shit gets snoozeville. 
p1179
aVYeah I guess I can see, but I just fucking love the dissonance and tapping that Josh does. Layne's style was more mathy, which I also loved. Just with the production was better, but that was also 8-10 years ago
p1180
aVi like the dissonant tapping too but you can have a band like IWABO who does that stuff AND has music thats all over the place and interesting 
p1181
aVI guess it's the way it is, bc I can't stand IWABO haha
p1182

aVObligatory Jonny Craig mention - he's a scummy person in general but his voice gives me images of flying with angels in my head. \u000a\u000aAlso BMTH, their last album I actually liked well enough to download was Suicide Season but I will listen to any of their newer music just to appreciate their instrumentals, mainly the drums.
p1186
aVJohnny Craig is very impressive. He's improving himself daily though. 
p1187
aVDanny Worsnop. He's a douchebag and from what I've heard kinda fucks up his live performances, but damn do I like his voice.
p1188
aVRonnie Radke is a tool and responsible for some awful music, but when he gets the songwriting right, like ETF's There's No Sympathy For The Dead it's amazing.

aVMeh, the only song I though was at all interesting from PGP6 was ABR's cover of Wrecking Ball, and even that I got tired of pretty quickly
p1209
aVMan, listening to this and then listening to their Payphone cover, what a major letdown this was. Its not a bad cover, but they could have done something way better than this.\u000a\u000aAnd I'd rather have an MV of the Sweater Weather cover. Loved that cover.\u000a\u000a
p1210
aVI agree, too much like the original. I really like the original version, but I definitely would have preferred CtE going all out in their style on this. It could've been legendary. \u000a\u000aThis isn't bad though. Several funny bits in the video, too. 
p1211
asVDo you prefer screams,cleans or mixed and why?
p1212
(lp1213
VDefinitely screams, while I can appreciate good clean vocals, I feel like a lot of bands just throw in a chorus when they can't think of anything else, and it just sounds really boring. I'd much prefer a band just scream, and then have the melody come from the instrumental parts
p1214
aVI like when there are two vocalists that either have both screams or cleans and screams.  \u000a\u000aFor example, Erra has punishing screams with crazy clean parts.\u000a\u000aBorn of Osiris uses Ronnie's screams and Joe's screams perfectly together.
p1215
aVErra's cleans are hard as shit. And that's coming from someone who can sing well into the 6th octave with head voice. The clean vocalist is a powerhouse belter in my opinion. 
p1216
aVI like both. Screams for brutality and cleans for catchiness.
p1217
aVI prefer both. TAA is a good example of what I like, Joel has brutal screams that hit hard and Ahren has nice contrasting melodies.
p1218
aVIt really depends on the band. In general, I prefer all screams, cause those are the heaviest bands. Yet two of my last three favorite bands were sing-only bands. Lastly, I often hate it when a heavy band tries to incorporate choruses/refrains and yet try screaming through it. Gotta have the dynamism of clean vocals for that, in my opinion.\u000a\u000aExamples of all three done right are (in respect to the order of the OP) Volumes (pre-No Sleep), Hands Like Houses, and newer Elitist
p1219
aV[Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktuWC9ZXdkY). I like growls/screams over the riffs because it's easier to pay attention to the guitars and drums. But I also like a clean chorus.

aVThere are a bunch of The Amity Affliction songs that relate to this. Like Pittsburgh, Geof Sux 666, R.I.P Bon, I Hate Hartley and Anchors.
p1245
aVYes!  I was hoping someone would say Amity Affliction.  I think their best anti-suicide song is Don't Lean On Me, but that's just my opinion.  \u000a\u000aAnother "possible" song would be Beneath the Sky "7861" It's about a friend who killed himself over a girl... tragic :(\u000aedit: I just wanted to add "Life in Your Way" - "Making Waves" .. it will give you goosebumps!
p1246
aVIt's not really an anti suicide song (apart from a few lines). It's more about how fans ask Joel for advice on depression etc. but he doesn't have the answers.
p1247

aVI'm actually not sure what the message is but there's always Suicide Season (the song) by Bring Me

aVIt's about when one of Oli's best friends lost someone close to him due to suicide. Basically about how his friend fell apart.\u000a\u000aFor example: 'We would do anything to bring him back to you.\u000aWe would do anything to end what you're going through.'

aVYeah that's very true! 
p1273
aVI just looked up the lyrics and im pretty confused also.\u000aFor example "Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end" could mean that the situation not that bad or that death is not the end, also "Death is only a horizon And I'm ready for my sun to set " sounds again that its pro suicide

p1304
(lp1305
VIf you ever get the chance to see this band live, *do it*.
p1306
aVI've seen them live twice, but I was never actually into them until after. That makes me really mad.
p1307
aVI saw them at warped and they had so many backtracks but their vocalist was good and they put on a decent show.
p1308
aVYeah dude, they're one of my most wanted bands to see sometime. From the live's I've seen yeah there's backtrack, but the vocals are fucking incredible, they accompany each other so well, and overall these dudes put on a great show. Though, yeah they should get a member or two to play the instrumentals right.
p1309
aVDiego and Raad are pretty talented at the guitar and bass, respectively. But most metalcore bands tend to have at least two guitarists, and Volumes has to make do with just one for live play. I've never had an issue with the backtracking, because I understand the reason, but I could see adding another guitarist being beneficial to live play. \u000a\u000aRegardless, Michael and Gus know how to fucking *move* during a set. So much energy at their shows!
p1310
aVCan't agree more. One of the sickest sets I've ever seen.
p1311
aVDude I saw them live once and they fucking sucked a bag of dicks. They were so fucking high from smoking up before the set that they couldn't even set up and once they finally did, they only had time to play 3 of there shittiest songs. Smh.
p1312
aVWHERE WILL I END UP TONIGHT
p1313
aVThis reminds me of bleed by mesuggah a bit
p1314
aVDefinitely prefer this album to No Sleep. 
p1315
aVThis song is great from 2:28 until 3:35 other than that 0-00-0-1-0-000.
p1316
aVNot really..
p1317
aVI'm not going to bash the band because they don't seem bad, but this song is literally just 0-00-1b2b1-0-00 over and over until the second guitar comes in.\u000a\u000aThe small solo was pretty cool though :P I need to listen to the whole album, a lot of people are telling me this is the more generic song they have
p1318
aVI like the song Intake the most. mainly for the lyrics. it's not the most complicated, but it's a very touching song. \u000a
p1319
aVI'm with you. It's an amazing song.
p1320
aVwhen did music become about whether or not it's fucking technical?
p1321
aVIt's not that it's not technical the timings are pretty technical it's just that it's really boring. 
p1322
aVI didn't even get that far into it. It's hard to make screaming over heavy technical music seem boring, but this song did it.
p1323
aVThat's what's so great about this genre though. There are some really technical bands you can get into if this band doesn't suit you. There are even technical bands like Tesseract (even though that's not really metalcore) that put out albums with no growls (see: Altered State). \u000a\u000aThis band isn't trying to cram solos and sweeps into every verse. They're just fun and heavy, with moderately technical rhythms sprinkled throughout their albums. I love Volumes.

asVNew Vol/tures teaser
p1325
(lp1326
Vcant FUCKING WAIT
p1327
aVI hope there's vocals, but if it's instrumental that's perfectly fine with me. As long as it's something being made by Structures, even if it's only half.
p1328
aVi hope its not just Andrew working on it...I want some of the guitar work in there aswell, and some mix of their screams would be DOPE.  All i've seen of it is Andrew with'm though. better than nothing I suppose.
p1329
aVI agree. I'm still super bummed they broke up :(
p1330
aVI saw that Spyros was in California with Nick, but wasn't ever pictured working with Volumes. The Structures Facebook hinted in a comment that Nick might be involved in it. \u000a\u000aIt's pretty easy now to share ideas and record while being separated, so I wouldn't rule anyone out. 
p1331
aVthatd be fucking EPIC
p1332
aVSpencer?
p1333
aVI meant Spyros (the guitarist), but Spencer is their old bassist. 
p1334
aVI just didn't know the bassists name haha
p1335
aVIt sounds exactly like how I thought it would, &amp; im excited. 
p1336
aVOkay, so I love Volumes and Structures, but I haven't been paying attention to them much. Can someone explain what's going on? I already know about Structures breaking up. 
p1337
aVA long time ago when both bands first toured together, they talked about both bands doing a project together. They kinda hyped it up and even made merch for the project, but never did anything after that...until now!
p1338
aVI think, back in the day, the two bands toured together and something came up about the two bands collaborating together, whether it was a joke or a rumor. Fast forward a few years, and now they are actually working on a project together..\u000a\u000aThat could be completely wrong, but I think I'm about 86% positive that that is what is going on..
p1339
aVSo fucking pumped for this. Vol/tures is such a badass collab name.
p1340
aVAm I the only one that finds these riffs groovy as fuck?
p1341
aVDefinitely not 
p1342
aVPerhaps its because I don't listen to either band very much AT ALL, so don't hate me for saying this...but isn't it a bit redundant? This project seems like just another moniker to make the same sounding style of music both bands made before. But then again, maybe I don't know the music as well as some of you. 
p1343
aVEven both bands being as what people say is "djent," they're not too similar. Volumes is a lot more groovier, and Structures are more technical and have more of a hardcore sound. 
p1344
aVWhy have I just now heard about this?? Is this like a collab album/EP between Structures and Volumes? Fucking awesome teaser!
p1345
aVKinda shitty, not as stoked for it as I thought I was but I'll try to keep an open mind until i hear the full ep/album/song/whatever.
p1346
aVIt's 15 seconds...

aVBorn of Osiris is pretty good, especially the newest album with all of the cool synth-y stuff\u000a\u000aEdit: Or if you're looking for something softer, maybe stuff from the album Singularity by Northlane and their new song Rot, lots of cool melodic stuff, plus some nice bouncy riffs

aVA Day to remember is generally referred to as a metalcore band.
p1387
aVOr a post-hardcore band or an easycore band. The fact is those aren't metalcore songs. They're pop punk and easycore/post-hardcore
p1388
aValright, my mistake, I'm sorry, I spend more time listening to music than focusing on sub genre
p1389
aVWell, you asked for metalcore songs for parties, yet post non-metalcore songs. 
p1390
aVBut you posted in a subgenre subreddit. /r/music is that way -----&gt;
p1391
aVYeah, and I'd get nothing

aVDunno why everyone is being a tool to you. Definitely add Downfall Of Us All by ADTR.
p1393
aVI do, because people in this subreddit are giant douches.
p1394
aVIdk, I just want music by metalcore bands without screams or breakdowns etc and used ADTR as an example...
p1395
aVI see what kind of suggestions you want friend, but asking for metalcore songs without screams or breakdowns is like asking for water that isn't wet. Those are two defining of the factors in modern metalcore.

p1399
aVEnd of the World Party? Anybody?
p1400
aVThe problem with finding downtempo/softer metalcore is that metalcore bands put their most somber/depressing lyrics into their softer material. If you want a softer sound for the party, but still have a metal sound, some of the lyric subject matter might not match a kickback vibe. Regardless, here's my best shot at fulfilling your request:\u000a\u000a[Lead Sails Paper Anchor - Atreyu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_Nc3UMvjk)\u000a\u000a[Relief - Bury Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hTKs2RB6OE)\u000a\u000a[Said and Done - Eighteen Visions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-JLqnh3Ww)\u000a\u000a[God Damn Me - Filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2RRsxevhqw)\u000a\u000a[Miles Away Acoustic - Memphis May Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qZY3Tv3Z9c)\u000a\u000a[Means to Believe - Oh, Sleeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhYjUapKKak)\u000a\u000a[Autumn - Oh, Sleeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TVjZSu-FY)\u000a\u000a[Page Avenue: 10 Years and Counting - Story of the Year (the whole album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A34rt4j7mo&amp;list=PLbFhJxfKzQNjtNaFE1otsv-uKDYtD7Kw3)\u000a\u000aEDIT: [Dream Catcher Acoustic - Set It Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx-2n4SHepc)\u000a\u000aCheck those out and steer me in the right direction if it's not quite what you're looking for.

aVI completely agree with you, I'll check those out. He really likes Atreyu so that's a start.\u000a\u000aAlso, trying to push this point across, it doesn't necessarily have to be acoustic, just no screams or breakdowns. Use the songs I referenced in the OP as a basis.
p1402
aVIf you're looking for stuff without screams or breakdowns, you're in the wrong place, if you want stuff like lighter ADTR, try /r/poppunkers

p1430
aVSoo I like the song. I like the chorus, I like the breakdowns. Landon sounds swell and all. But the guitars straight up sound like pooooop. They have no kick. When that last breakdown kicks in, it just doesn't pack a punch like it should. 
p1431
aVThere's a fart at 2:52\u000a\u000aLandon, you bastard...

aVI don't think I'm gonna be able to listen to the song without noticing that every single time
p1433
aVHaha i was wondering if anyone else heard it too
p1434
aVseriously though, why?
p1435
aVI think a lot of producers like to do stuff like this just for fun. I know that Joey Sturgis likes to put random farts in songs too.
p1436
aVThis is actually a thing?

aVExceeded every expectation I had, some real next level shit

p1439
aVThat chorus!!!! So good :D
p1440
aVInteresting, not completely sure what to think of this yet, didn't have too high expectations, since I wasn't too into their older stuff. I really liked the lyrics to this one though\u000a\u000aEdit: Also just really liked the general atmosphere of it
p1441
aVI like this more than almost anything on their last album. I love the chord progression and like you said, the atmosphere is sweet.
p1442
aVCompletely agree with you, I also really like how much emotion is in the vocals
p1443
aVYes, Landon is an amazing vocalist.
p1444
aVThis song is really showing me that, I guess I never really gave him much of a chance before, because the last album sort of kept me from getting into them
p1445
aVLoved the atmosphere on this song. It's a different direction that what we are usually accustomed to with TPIY but it's a really solid track. Landon writes in many different styles but he always seems to bring it home. 
p1446
aVI liked this, nothing really special about it, but it pleased my ear holes
p1447
aVI didn't dislike their older material, but it didn't exactly hook me (This was also before I really got into heavier metalcore).\u000a\u000aI like this a lot more. Great chorus
p1448
aVThis was so much better than I anticipated. I love when that happens.
p1449
aVYES YES YES. I have always been a fan of Plot, but THIS is everything I look for in a song. Great work, I cannot for the new album.
p1450
aVI feel like it's easy to tell that this song started with the vocals/lyrics and the music got thrown on top of it. The lyrics and melodies are all really good and Landon's vocals are the best they've ever been but the music is definitely just supporting Landon. I hope the rest of the new stuff is more well-rounded \u000a
p1451
aVLandon's vocals are easily the best thing about this. I'm constantly impressed with how versatile he is. The music itself wasn't very creative though, and the breakdown felt a bit forced. Either way, I'm super stoked for the rest of the album and curious to see how different it is from their older stuff. Also, I love the tones and production way more than CYWYCB.
p1452
aVI feel like it's always been that way with the plot in you. I don't think that's a bad thing either
p1453
aVIs anyone else heading solo project in his vocals? Like, he spent a long time improving his singing for his solo stuff and now he's incorporating that style into Plot.
p1454
aVWow I'm loving this track
p1455
aVDang, really digging this. Definitely a progression from their last album.
p1456
aVI believe they are on artery now.  Idk how I feel about this song.  I loved the last breakdown but the whole song was just a little boring and less emotion.
p1457
aVon the contrary, i felt like it had a ton of emotion, just not portrayed in the way we're used to from TPIY. i love the song, personally, got chills at a number of points through the song. 
p1458
aVI agree with you, it definitely had a lot of emotion. In fact, I feel that, in a way, it had more emotion than most of their other stuff. It wasn't so anger focused, it still had a lot of anger in it, but their were a lot of other emotions mixed in. 
p1459
aVNo surprises on artery really.\u000a\u000aThey seem to scoop up everything dropped by Sumerian/Fearless/Rise\u000a(not thats that a bad plan, but not signing anything new really...)
p1460
aVThe Plot In You was on Rise before right?
p1461
aVYep
p1462
aVThat name tho
p1463
aVYeah I have to agree with you. I'm getting the whole nu metal feel from this. ~~A little disappointing.~~\u000a\u000aGave it another listen. It might not be as heavy as their previous releases, but it's much better than any other band going for this sound ^Such^as^Of^Mice^&amp;^Men.\u000a\u000aAnd they at least still threw in the breakdown at the end so they aren't completely gong away from their sound.
p1464
aV[deleted]
p1465
aVi loved the track but i don't think they're going soft. definetly gonna have some heavy track too. they've been playing a song live i think its called crows, but it pretty classic tpiy
p1466
aVThis is AMAZING. Landons vocals sound so clean, but the breakdown about 2 minutes in feels almost nostalgic. Amazing work.
p1467
aVReally like this new song.
p1468
aVMy rating is a solid ehh/10. I seriously can't decide if I like it. I like Landon's vocals (although I always like his vocals) but the breakdown felt forced and the lyrics I felt were kinda weaker and whinier then their other stuff.

asVMattie Montgomery - Liberty University Convocation
p1470
(lp1471
VThe intro by that guy is exactly why seeing For Today live is horrible. Mattie is more interested in preaching (and they literally admit to it being preaching and call it as such) than he is in putting on a show.
p1472
aVI feel like For Today's reputation for preaching is way overblown. I saw them recently with Silent Planet and Phinehas - two openly Christian bands. They barely preached, and that's one of the settings where Mattie would have been justified to preach quite a bit. Most people I know irl who have seen For Today live with non-christian bands said Mattie preached even less. This is just my personal anecdote though, and it happened pretty recently, so maybe they used to be worse about it.
p1473
aVI've seen For Today north of ten times, and in most cases the preaching works as a filler while the others are switching guitars or tuning... people on Reddit act like they spend 25 minutes of a 30 minute set preaching instead of playing.\u000a\u000a//Edit: also, this post is (arguably) not relevant to this subreddit)
p1474
aVEh. Tyler Carter, Matty Mullins, and others have their solo stuff posted here all the time and it's not metalcore at all, but it's allowed since it's relevant to popular metalcore figures. This isn't a music project though so it might be more of a stretch. 
p1475
aVI saw them 2 years ago with TDWP and AILD, and For Today preached for longer than both combined. It was unbearable and completely turned me away from them.
p1476
aVyou're actually not allowed to criticize For Today in this subreddit because the moshbros4christ show up and downvote you and get super angry.\u000a\u000aanyways, anyone remember when their guitarist came out as a homophobe?
p1477
aVI only saw him get one downvote. For Today gets criticized in this sub all the time in this sub and it gets upvoted, and for perfectly valid reasons. If you're getting downvoted it's probably because you bring up irrelevant stuff like their ex-guitarist saying homophobic stuff 2 years ago.
p1478
aV/u/nohitter21 is getting downvoted in this thread for saying he didn't like the preaching. all of his comments have the little + next to the score meaning he has gotten as many downvotes as upvotes to have only 1 point. do you have the controversial comment icon enabled in your preferences?\u000a\u000atl;dr - each of his comments have gotten like ~15+ upvotes/~15+ downvotes.

I remember RES used to show it but it got removed a while ago. \u000a\u000aIt's pretty lame that people are downvoting him for expresing his opinion. I'm kind of surprised because I typically see that same sentiment getting upvoted.

p1482
aVBelieve it or not, I actually made it through the entire video and let me tell you, this was VERY different from what I was expecting. He basically admits that ever since he joined For Today, his goal was to pursue fame and preach in his music and make a name for himself to please God. He loved the praise and recognition he would get from people after shows. But he realized that he didn't have to preach to the entire world to be a good Christian and that all he had to do was be faithful. There's one line in particular that struck me and that was when he said "I'm grateful to be here and have this giant platform to speak, but I'd be just fine without it." His honesty about himself really changed my view of him, it seems like he's really matured over the years.

VIf you have $150, get a Shure sm57.  It's probably the most widely used microphone there has ever been.  Great for vocals, drums, guitar, etc.  It's the first mic I ever bought and I still use it every time I record drums or guitar amps.\u000a\u000aEDIT you'll want to pick up a stand and a windscreen for vocals.  You can get em both cheap on Amazon with the money you'll have left over.\u000a\u000aEDIT Amazon link http://www.amazon.com/Shure-Instrument-Microphone-Windscreen-Polishing/dp/B001I2GY1I/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424996763&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=Sm57
p1624
aVProbably a good op to listen to the actual producer right here
p1625
aVHow would you use it when mic-ing up a kit? I've used them for kick drums live, but never have in a recording
p1626
aVGo to the biggest studios in the world, and they will almost all use an sm57 on the topside snare.  You can also get great results on toms, bottom snare, spot cymbals, etc. Kick would be better on the batter/beater side for added attack in addition to a proper kick mic, as you won't get a ton of low-end from them.
p1627
aVRight on man, thanks for the reply
p1628
aVI was going to suggest the shur sm58 but this is also a good choice. Both widely used across music.

aVI have a [CAD condenser mic](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/condenser-microphones/cad-gxl3000bp-multi-pattern-condenser-microphone?rNtt=cad%20condesner&amp;index=8) that has done me plenty of good.
p1630
aVyou'll probably want a good condenser [mic like this one](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-AT2035-Diaphragm-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B00D6RMFG6/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425045572&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=condenser+audio+technica). they're great for recording harsh vox. \u000a\u000acomes with everything you need, they even throw in a pop filter. \u000a\u000ayou'll also need a USB audio-interface along with whatever mic you purchase.

aVNever quite liked this song, weakest track on the album for sure. But I hope Sam does some guest vocals on the next BMTH album.
p1751
aVWhat?!?! This is definitely one of the better songs on Suicide Season. The only ones that really give it much competition are Chelsea Smile, Diamonds and the title track IMO.
p1752
aVI've always been partial to "No Need For Introductions, I've Read About Girls Like You On the Backs of Toilet Doors."
p1753
aVThe story behind the track is hilarious but it's not exactly a banger i'd put on my BMTH playlist lol
p1754
aVVery short, has hilarious piano intro, and lets me howl out the window about my ex? Sounds like a joy to me.
p1755
aVTry Death Breath for weakest track. This one shows a lot more emotion than most other songs on the album.
p1756
aVThe remix of Death Breath I thought was actually quite good. I don't like electronic stuff but that whole Cut-Up! album was my jam for awhile. Wish more bands did stuff like that.

p1758
(lp1759
VAll of Count Your Blessings
p1760
aVIf Oli could power through it, I'd pay good money.
p1761
aVAll of Thrill Seeker by August Burns Red, redoing the vocals with Jake wouldn't be bad either
p1762
aVThat would be awesome!  It would be super cool if JB revamped some of the riffs too.
p1763
aVThat could be cool too, though I think the riffs are pretty good as they are, it's more the vocals that I have issues with
p1764
aVThrill Seeker sounds great as it is. Josh McManness was a beast on that album too. I don't want them to rerecord it even as a huge ABR fan. 
p1765
aVI just wasn't a huge fan of Josh's vocals or the production on that album
p1766
aVNorthlane-Keymaker\u000a\u000a\u000aParkway Drive-Dead Dreams\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord by The Devil Wears Prada\u000a\u000a\u000a
p1767
aVI honestly think if TDWP tried to re-record Dear Love it wouldn't work at all. Their sound is way too different at this point.
p1768
aVMaybe not necessarily a "remastering," but I'd like to see Our Last Night re-record some of their oldest stuff now that they're all older and sound much better. Back on the first record, Trevor was 12-13 and the uncleans were pretty bad. Post-pubescent Trevor, however, has an amazing unclean voice. Imagine Escape re-recorded with him now. Eargasm. 
p1769
aVoh god yes, listening to We Will All Evolve again just now made me realize how much a remaster of The Ghost Among Us would blow me away
p1770
aVSomeone pitch dropped some songs off of Ghosts Among Us and its awesome.\u000aStill would love to hear Trevor's screaming on that.\u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/austincolby/symptoms-of-a-failing-system
p1771
aVThe burial plot war unbidden by Every Time I Die, despite what I've read on the internet I really enjoyed this ep and I have bought the remastered one I think but it still could have a lot of work. What I really like about it, is that the vocals are like a mix of Code Orange Kids and Converge. Here is a [song so you can tell for yourself](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L9dUuMWHzm4)
p1772
aVReflections' Exi(s)t needs to be remastered. Like right now. Eyal Levi is a god awful producer. Also Chelsea Grin's Desolation of Eden. Tim Lambesis fucked that album up badly.
p1773
aVWhat's wrong with Desolation of Eden? Exi(s)t doesn't sound too bad, IMO The Fantasy Effect could use a remaster much more than Exi(s)t.
p1774
aVBoth albums by Reflections clip like a motherfucker
p1775
aVWhat do you mean by clip?
p1776
aVClipping is a form of waveform distortion that occurs when an amplifier is overdriven and attempts to deliver an output voltage or current beyond its maximum capability. \u000a\u000aIt's like when there's too much bass is sounds like horrible buzzing 
p1777
aVAhh okay. Yeah I agree, both Reflections albums do have that issue. Honestly I just thought that was a style they were trying to go for.
p1778
aVIf you listen to them with subs, it sounds terrible 
p1779
aVDesolation sounds *too* clean for that kind of music. It should be a little rough, but Tim just really ran it through the rinse cycle a few times too many.
p1780
aVVolumes - The Concept of Dreaming EP. It's already really good, but I always have wanted to hear it how they sound now.

aVBury Tomorrow is so awesome, if you ever get the chance to see them live definitely go and see them, these guys put on the best fucking live show.
p1798
aVWow two really great bands that I've never heard of. Thanks, I'll definitely have to take a listen to more of their stuff. I'm into post-hardcore but have gotten more into the metalcore genre as of late, or at least some of the mainstream stuff. I know all of the other bands you listed but thank you still! \u000a\u000aGo ahead and suggest more. Just more for me to add to my driving playlist.

p1801
aVSee oddly enough that band Currents was really good to me, even though there weren't any cleans it felt good to understand what he was saying. Definitely a good listen and a Periphery vibe to them, will be playing that EP some more. \u000a\u000aIf I Were You, very good as well! Also a little bit of a CTE sound to them, such a deep find with only 1000 views. A Thing About Machines was a really good band as well, interesting how they put some synth in there it really ties the song together.\u000a\u000aOceans Ate Alaska is a really good new and upcoming band as well, I've just recently listened to them, love the different sound from a lot of the other stuff that is out there. \u000a\u000aI Capture Castle was really good, I'm a sucker for Tyler Carter. \u000a\u000aJohari was actually one of my favorites, they sound really good! Thanks for all of these bands, I know it probably took some time :D I appreciate it! 
p1802
aVNo problem! I found most of those bands on spotify discover mode and what not. Johari said they were releasing new stuff this summer, I'm excited for that, as well as A thing about machines has new stuff coming out soon hopefully. Also I fell in love with periphery this month when I finally gave their stuff a listen, amazing band.
p1803
aVYou like Periphery eh? Check out [Novallo](http://novallo.bandcamp.com/). They currently have just one EP out, [but are about to release their debut album.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV06VPR9r0Q)
p1804
aVWow, love these guys! Thanks for the recommendation. Definitely a Periphery and maybe a little Coheed feel to it. Great band.  
p1805
aVGlad to hear it! I just realized the first link I posted was incorrect, it's fixed now and leads to their first EP.
p1806
aVHaha, yeah I was wondering why it lead to something else, but there second EP trailer was good as well. Going to listen to some of that first EP now. Thanks. 
p1807
aVNo problem! One of the songs from their new album is also available in full [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz70wI49ExQ) The production quality of their first EP isn't as good, but other than that it's awesome.

aVThanks! I already looked through that and while it is a nice page to look at I was looking for some more underground stuff. :)
p1816
aVAh no problem my friend, I just used that as a reference because I don't know where to begin with Periphery and am not familiar with the style. But I hope you find some nice new stuff through others!
p1817
aVThanks, actually giving it another look there are a lot of bands I haven't heard of under the Periphery tab (duh forgot to even look there). Thanks for letting me know again! :)

aVI usually look off of my friends Spotify/Last.fm/Pandora/BandCamp to find new bands. Try that.

aVJust did last night and you were right, found a band called SkyHarbour which are really good. Like their sound, just wish they were a little heavier. Thanks!
p1820
aVI don't see it suggested yet, but you seem to like djent pretty well, head on over to /r/djent, there's a ton of djent with cleans and screaming, and only clean as well. 
p1821

aVArchitects are a good band, just a little too heavy for my taste. Still have a lot of respect for them though! :)

aVIn Hearts Wake.
p1824
aVWow, they're pretty good. Any band from Australia will catch my eye, they typically crank out some good bands. Thanks! 
p1825
aVI think you would really dig [Life on Repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2CbX3BUPFc). Awesome band if you have never heard of them. I should mention that they did break up shortly after this release which was quite disappointing but I feel you would truly enjoy this.  
p1826
aVWow! I love these guys, this is what I'm talking about! I hate finding bands that have broken up, because usually they kick ass. Definitely going to be playing this album on repeat for the next few weeks. Thanks dude!

aVThey'll be around for 3 more years at the very most.
p1843
aVLmao. Beartooth as the future. I can't even. 
p1844
aVI love them but there's really nothing unique or memorable about them; they're more of a listen when I'm feeling angry/pumped. I can't really see them becoming the future of metalcore as there's no redeeming quality to their music or their appeal. They're just five regular dudes jamming out, nothing more and nothing less.
p1845
aVI think the most memorable thing would be that Caleb did literally everything, on the album he played all the instruments and did the editing, the rest of the band is just for touring.
p1846
aVNobody pays attention to that at all. It's hard to be original when you're doing everything. Also, the amount of emotion that Caleb uses is insane, and I don't know of another band that does that. Or not at least as well as Caleb does. 
p1847
aVThis thread really hates Beartooth. To answer your question I thinks it's impossible to know where Beartooth will go since they've only released one full album and one of the more popular songs on that album was from the former ep. That being said I think it's stupid to think they can't be front leader in this genre I know a lot of friends who don't listen to anything even vaguely metal who like Beartooth cause Beaten in Lips and In Between having been getting some radio play, it definitely shows they're making a name out there and could even surpass Of Mice and Men as the big ones of the genre.
p1848
aVdae this generic band is the future of the scene
p1849
aVIs the scene really anything but generic at this point?
p1850
aVThis is plenty of good stuff out there, more so the older stuff or the underground stuff and any of the mathcore or blackened stuff is great. At least in my opinion.
p1851
aVOh I'm not denying that metalcore is good at all. I love the genre! I mean the mainstream metalcore scene right now is really generic. I love a lot of the types of stuff you listed there. Sorry for any confusion!
p1852
aVOh I thought you were saying something else. Totally cool man, no worries my fault. I thought you were just algoods with the genre being generic.
p1853
aVn-no you don't understand because I like this band they must be the future of the scene

aVBeartooth has been a thing since Caleb was in Attack Attack! and they've released stuff before 2013.
p1867

p1872
aVBeartooth seems to have gotten popular really fast, probably due to Caleb being in Attack Attack before.  I think that due to their ever increasing popularity, they very well might be one of the new big names in the scene. However, the Disgusting album was quite generic and I would appreciate them changing it up on the next album. \u000a\u000aAlso, I think they may tour a little too much as the live videos I've seen lately have shown Caleb being pretty burnt out.
p1873
aVSeeing them live there was a surprising amount of time where he wasnt singing, the crowd knew every word so they picked it all up, also at one point all of Vanna came out on stage and took over for the whole band then left after one song, super strange but awesome.
p1874
aVI think they're rad. I don't listen to them a whole lot, but they're a good band, and different enough to be noticeable. And from what I hear they put on a great show, so I can see them having staying power.

p1908
(lp1909
VIt's legit as fuck in terms of Pop Punk. The Wonder Years, Trophy Eyes, Neck Deep, Transit, Have Heart, Handguns, Seaway, As It Is and others. For Metalcore... Not really. 
p1910
aVWell, you see, metalcore isn't the only genre of music that people like. It's called variety. 
p1911
aVTransit is fucking amazing and is probably the best band announced at the moment.
p1912
aVHonestly I'd go to the Houston date for RiFF RAFF haha
p1913
aVrotting out and being as an ocean...two bands :(\u000aseaway is awesome but they are local for me
p1914
aVAsking Alexandria are there for the first time since 2011 so a lot of people are definitely going to want to go. The line up is definitely not the best though, I haven't even heard of most of the bands on it. It seems like there's a lot of young and new bands playing.
p1915
aVAsking Alexandria also doesn't have Danny any more, so hopefully their live performance still packs a punch
p1916
aVWell assuming they replace him with someone who doesn't dress up as a cowboy and try to turn their songs into Def Leppard covers, I think their live show will be just fine.\u000a\u000aOtherwise, #ClassicRock4Life
p1917
aVMy thoughts exactly. Hopefully their new vocalist doesn't have scarf on the mic stand and cowboy boots.
p1918
aVImo any tour with Blessthefall, the wonder years, abd neck deep is pretty tight 
p1919
aVIn terms of the lineup, this year is undoubtedly one of the worst in recent years. But kids will want to go, for the reasons given by other users. However unfortunate it is that kids like Black Veil Brides, Asking Alexandria, etc., it's a fact of life and Kevin Lyman's just trying to bring in money. That's how it goes.
p1920
aVWarped Tour is almost always shitty, but this year they're really going over the top in shitty. Mayhem's looking real nice this year. Can't wait for that. 
p1921
aVWho's all going to Mayhem so far?
p1922
aVI don't think they have said thus far?
p1923
aVI'm stoked af. I'll get to see AA, Amity Affliction, and Our Last Night. All three bands I've wanted to see for a while, especially TAA and OLN. And warped has had rappers and stuff before, and they've always had pretty large amounts of pop punk bands, so I see no problem.
p1924
aVAsking isn't coming to my show. :( but I'm not saying Warped sucks now, but I'm just bothered that the days of Whitechapel suicide silence and parkway all being on the tour are over. But I'm still over the moon that Trophy Eyes, While She Sleeps, and BAAO are gonna be there.
p1925
aVI would be so happy if PWD went to warped
p1926
aVSo far the only bands I'm looking forward to are Fit For a King, Blessthefall, Being as an Ocean, and Hudredth
p1927
aVMy inside sources are telling me Memphis May Fire is still to be announced, as well as the rest of the bands from The Get Real Tour. So that's 5 more solid metalcore bands for ya.\u000a\u000aBut the BVB hate is a little unwarranted these days. In my opinion. They are no longer the scene stars they once were with their first album, when they were coming out on stage all decked out in leather and war paint. These days they sound like a poor man's A7X, and just put out their least "hate-able" album yet. That being said, I know they have a ton of fans still in this scene and it makes sense for them to play Warped even though they no longer have a Warped Tour sound. So basically, if you don't wanna see them, don't. If you go to Warped, there's like 10 stages. For this reason exactly. 
p1928
aVI'd say that their last album, wretched and divine was the most easily likable. Their newest is just boring. 
p1929
aVI agree with that dude, W&amp;D is solid (and so damn catchy) but the s/t gets a little boring after a few spins. 
p1930
aVExcept the word alive 
p1931
aVThe word alive puts on a solid show and plays from every album. Whether you like their latest album or not, you'll here something you like. 
p1932
aVI meant TWA isn't gonna be on warped, but every other band from that tour is.
p1933
aVI am not a metalcore bashing elitist. I'm not one of those douches that claims Warped hasn't been good since the 90s. I love Warped. I love metalcore. That's why I go. So when they transitioned from primarily punk to metalcore I was really happy. But now it's almost as if they're going from metalcore to pop or to basically just shitty scene music. We can just hold out hope I guess that the headliners are going to be heavy, but selling my ticket and going to Summer Slaughter or Mayhem sounds really appealing now. I mean, Black Veil Brides... really!?! Sorry rant over. Anybody else have any opinions on this?
p1934
aVThe scene changes. This isn't the first time Black Veil Brides has been on the tour. Last time they were, the crowd I saw watching them was quite large. Their music is popular among the crowd Warped draws in. I'm not a fan of BVB, but I also don't think they are shit. It would be dumb for Warped to not take this band on tour, because it brings them money. More money = more Warped. There have been some good bands announced so far, just wait, I'm sure more bands you like will be announced.
p1935
aVI definitely feel like warped has transitioned to fit with them times... and popular bands these times in the scene is pop... so theyre just doing what they can to attract kids. However I Killed the Prom Queen, The Amity Affliction, Fit For A King, Blessthefall, Sirens &amp; Sailors, Hundredth, and Crossfaith are all on the tour and those are bands ill for sure be checking out so there is still a strong possibility of more metalcore being announced. hold tight!:)
p1936
aVYou don't have to watch black veil brides yknow
p1937
asVWhat is your opinion on the Christian metal scene?
p1938
(lp1939
VIf the music is good, I don't care. 
p1940
aVI feel like this should be everyone's answer.
p1941
aVFor starters, I'm pretty sure TIJ isn't a "Christian band" anymore, I think they just have some Christian members.\u000a\u000aAs far as the whole "Christian scene" goes, if you don't like it, don't listen to it. Bitching about lyrical content or preachiness won't change a thing. 
p1942
aVThere are two parts to this question for me: Theologically and Musically.\u000a\u000aJust from an objective music stance: Christian bands in the genre are just as talented as everyone else. I think that its interesting that a lot of the bands that have really grown, nurtured, and sustain the scene are Christian-influenced (TDWP, Underoath, August Burns Red, AILD, Norma Jean, ect). And I think the heyday of metalcore was also the heyday of Christian metalcore (between 2003ish-2010ish), and part of that was due to those bands. But I just think its because they're honest dudes who wrote music they loved, and that moved them and people connected with it. \u000a\u000aTheologically: I hate attaching religion to a band. We don't apply people's political preferences (outside of like anarchist, we don't have "Republican" or "Independent" bands) for the most part. So why should  I don't care if you're christian, jewish, muslim, atheist, or whatever. Is your music good? Do I enjoy it? Cool. Is it nice to have music that aligns with my beliefs, but it doesn't make or break something. The only difference is that I can freely use music with christian lyrical content as worship, but that's it. If I'm just jamming out to whatever, then it doesn't matter. At this token: I DESPISE music made for christians. If you're writing a song to sell to a specifically christian audience because you want to make a "safe music environment" for people, then I am repulsed by what you do. This goes for 90% of christian radio (not so much the metalcore scene). If you're writing a song of worship that's one thing, but a christian radio single? That's gross. I hate the artists (Third Day, Toby Mac, Newsboys) who play only christian shows for only christian audiences and makes globs of money. As a christian, we are called to live out the great commission, and if you aren't doing that, then something's wrong. Most of the bands in this scene are trying to do that and that's cool. I'm not a big fan when people are over preachy (For Today, recent Matty Mullins), and I think your actions/lyrics should do your talking for you. If you want to open yourself up to talk about the thing you believe with your fans that's more than cool. But let the music and your worship show people what your believe, don't shove a message down their throats (It goes both ways too. I've seen bands who are atheists be like "Fuck God" in between their songs and stuff, and that's not cool either.) Just be respectful and cool about what people believe, and just listen to music you enjoy. Well, there's my rant about this. I went to a Christian high school, and so I was constantly getting in arguments about my "devil" music, and that's why I have so much to say about it. 
p1943
aVI absolutely love the scene.  I'm a confirmed Christian (but by no means would force religion down anyone's throat), and love the way August Burns Red intertwines religion into the lyrics, I think it's unique and just cool.  
p1944
aVI am in no way a christian but i have been jamming Phinehas lately and their lyrics are very christian but they rock so good i don't care.
p1945
aVI definitely like a bunch of Christian bands, but it really irritates me when Christian metalcore is labeled as a completely separate genre, or when Christian fans refuse to listen to any band that isn't Christian, even if the band isn't anti-religious at all 
p1946
aVI think people should do whatever they want when it comes to music. If they enjoy it, it's all good. Also, if I recall correctly Memphis may fire isn't Christian, they are just composed of christian members. 
p1947
aVI dunno man, when the majority of the lyrical content of their albums is about how awesome God is, I think it's safe to label them as a Christian band, regardless of what they say in interviews.
p1948
aVI haven't listened to all of their albums, just challenger. So that could very well could be the case. Maybe they're trying to avoid the "label" or whatever. 
p1949
aVTheir newest album went full Jesus... Except that at times, Matty seems to think he's god himself.. 
p1950
aVDamn man, I'll have to check it out. 
p1951
aVI agree, Challenger wasn't as bad, I actually love that entire album, but their latest album just went a little to far with the Christian stuff.  I get it, it influences your song writing, but he went full preacher on that record.
p1952
aVI actually thought Challenger was rather solid too... The band can be pretty good when it wants to 
p1953
aVYup, the intro song, Vices, Legacy.  I spent my entire summer listening to it when it came out.  Was super excited for their new album, and while there's a few songs I like, Challenger was by far the better album.
p1954
aVFor sure. I highly respect the two-way vocalists (Shane Told, Jeremy McKinnon, etc) 
p1955
aVI think its interesting. I love how For Today and Motionless in White tour together. But the real question is, how long will it last. The scene has grow, but what is its peak? 
p1956
aVI love a lot of bands that just so happen to be Christian bands.
p1957
aVI'm totally fine with it, and I don't see why anyone should have a problem with it just as long as the lyrics aren't too preachy or puritanical. If you purposely avoid listening to a band just because they're Christian, then you're just as bad as the Christian that refuses to listen to atheist bands.
p1958
aVAll depends on the band.
p1959
aVI think it's cool that we have bands that are free to express their ideas on religion (pro and anti) and be accepted either way, and also to accept each other regardless. The fact that For Today and Motionless in White have been on, what, three tours together now speaks volumes to the openness and welcoming nature of our scene, and I don't think we acknowledge that enough. 
p1960
aVTo be honest it seems that a lot of bands use the tag 'christian' like some sort of marketing tool. I've heard in many interviews with different bands that labels often asks if they can label the band as christian band cause it'll bost album sales...
p1961
aVThere is nothing wrong with this type of christian metalcore, I consider ABR my favorite band and i have for almost 6 years. I'm not religious at all. i love their style and the power in Matt and Jakes lyrical writing. you shouldn't overlook a band because of what they believe. as for the "rise" there are just as many anti religious bands out there if not more
p1962

p1969
aVYes. Define The Great Line. Anything from define the great line and on are worth the money.
p1970
aVDefine the Great Line is one of the top tier Metalcore albums, so that one\u000a\u000aThey're Only Chasing Safety is one of the top tier Post-Hardcore albums  if you like that sound more
p1971
aV I love underoath, from their old stuff to disambiguation when Aaron left. Their sound changed so much over the years especially between Dallas and Spencer. You really can't just listen to one album, they are all good. I would say my favorite is  cries of the past.\u000a\u000aI'm assuming you don't torrent music...\u000a\u000a  Do you live in the US? I'll mail you all 7 of their albums on a data disc
p1972
aVEither Define the Great Line or They're Only Chasing Safety.
p1973
aVI'm probably going to be that one guy who recommends "Lost in the Sound of Sound of Separation." I love that album. Or you can just listen to it on Youtube or something.
p1974
aVhonestly this album lately has grown on me a lot more. I'd even say its on par as a whole package with define the great line but its really just opinionated at this point. depends which type of vibes im tryna feel. LitSoS is a bit more experimental with some cool softer/mellow shit and im diggin it....plus dat abrupt transition into desperate times...chills
p1975
aVI'm so ashamed to say that I'm a huge metalcore/post-hardcore fan but never was able to get into Underoath...
p1976
aVLost in the sound of seperation has some of their best work in my opinion.  Cant *really* go wrong with define the great line of course its like their go to classic, and a benchmark in posthardcore and metalcore in general.  They're a true influence to hundreds of thousands in the genre.  I just really have been digging LitSoS lately.
p1977
aVDefine the Great Line is regarded as one of the best metalcore albums, normally the popular song on it being "Writing on the Walls." As far as my personal favorite, They're Only Chasing Safety wins that battle. Lost in the Sound of Separation has a lot more of the "Verse, Chorus, Verse" type songs. I consider it more mainstream friendly, but it is still a solid record.

VI will never understand the thought process behind using breakdowns as teasers. If anything, it makes me less interested in the album. 
p1989
aVNormally I'd disagree with you, if the breakdown is unique to the band's style, but this sounded like a sample loop from an electric keyboard. This teased nothing :-(
p1990
aVTrue, but I think it's fair to say that the world is running out of "unique" breakdowns, ya know?

aVDefinitely heavier, sounds generic as hell though
p1998
aVThat's like their definition
p1999
aVTrue, though their last album was a bit more interesting, at least IMO, seems like now that Danny's gone, they're going back to this. Not that they'd be any better still with him though, since he was completely ruining their live shows recently
p2000
aVI don't care how generic it is, Stand Up and Scream is the tits!     \u000a\u000aIt would be rad to have them go back to that sound again.
p2001
aVYeah and the funny part is that SUAS wasn't considered generic when it was released. The fact that they, together with Attack Attack! inspired so many bands to do electronicore is the reason that the sound is now generic. 
p2002
aVI'm most excited for is the riffs Ben puts on this record after saying "I want to write riffs you can sing along to like on A7X's City of Evil"....but then he teases this, which sounds like any breakdown ever made ever in the history of history. 
p2003
aVMaybe it'll have both
p2004
aVI think many of you are really falling on the word "teaser"\u000a\u000a\u000aI made it up for the post title. Ben probably just released this for the diehards.\u000a\u000a\u000aI will say im happy their not going all Classic Rock
p2005
aVGood to see theyre back to the heaviness. I'm very curious to hear the riff at the end though. The breakdown itself wasn't anything special
p2006
aVLooks like they've got their new member and Joey Sturgis is mixing the album. I can't wait. http://i.imgur.com/1aHJ3cv.jpg
p2007
aVI don't care if it's generic. I enjoy the hell out of Stand Up and Scream still. In fact, I'm a little tired of bands trying to be unique. Sometimes I just want some good ole breakdowns and sweet vocals. 
p2008
aVHoly generic

aVYou could just take the heavy 20 seconds from Creature off FDtD and play that as a teaser and people would think they album was going to be heavy aswell. 
p2019
aVGonna be honest this teaser really sucks it's just chugging for about 10 seconds while some images show on screen. It's like saying to have a teaser for a movie then the teaser is just a one of the cast members saying the name of the movie.

aVThe All-Stars tour is another example of how a tour can work with a ton of big name bands
p2046
aVThat tour was so awesome.
p2047
aVThere have been plenty of tours that have many big name bands. It just narrows down the types of venues the tour can hit.\u000a\u000aConsidering all of the bands are on one label, it would make it all much simpler as well
p2048
aVI could see that being a thing
p2049
aVI hope so. The 2011 Fearless Friends tour was a ton of fun. BTF, TWA, and MIW weren't as much on the metalcore side of things as they are today, and it also had chunk and tonight alive, but damn it was a fantastic show.\u000a\u000aWith those same bands taking a heavier sound, ABR getting signed, and new albums coming from ABR, BTF, Chunk, and recent release Oceans, the tour seems like a no brainer.\u000a\u000aAlmost every band would have an upcoming or recently released album
p2050
aVPlus I feel like ABR's going to have some great tours once their new album is released
p2051
aVDefinitely.\u000a\u000aAt the very least I want to see ABR and BTF release mind-blowingly awesome albums, then go on a tour together

aVI have My Curse by Killswitch from GH3 to blame for this.

aVHoly shit how did Iforget about that one?!

aVfor me, it was Danger: Wildman. I love the intro to the song.. never gets old
p2120
aVActually I thought this song was pretty good when I first heard it, but it was with the pre-album release of Sassafras that TDWP came into their own - both commercially and artistically. The whole album has a crisp, clear sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost.

p2138
aVI really liked This Ones For You, it was so fitting for an end track. 
p2139
aVI agree, that would probably follow the two previously mentioned tracks as my favorite on the album.
p2140
asVWhat bands do you think are ruined by the vocals?
p2141
(lp2142
VFor me its The Color Morale. Can't get passed Garret unfortunately. 
p2143
aVDefinitely agree about the new stuff, check out the album My Devil in Your Eyes though, the vocals on that one are great
p2144
aVAsking Alexandria's last album. 
p2145
aVIt isn't the vocals that ruin it. It's just very poor in general. 
p2146
aVThe vocals ruined any chance of me liking it.
p2147
aVMan, that's crazy. I dug the rough sounding vocals. It was just different from his higher pitcher whinier vocals. 
p2148
aVI just think a lot of bands are ruined by throwing in the clean choruses. I hate when I'm listening to a song that's nice and heavy in the beginning and then comes in the clean chorus that has been overused and really just deflates the hype of the song.
p2149
aVThe funny thing is that's sort of how I feel about Sirens &amp; Sailors
p2150
aVTheir cleans do get a little tiresome but as a whole band they are just too damn good IMO. 
p2151
aVI'm just not a huge fan, they're not terrible though, and they're pretty good live
p2152
aV[deleted]
p2153
aVI like their cleans. They usually find a good balance. 
p2154
aVI honestly think the amount of cleans is fine and a breath of fresh air in their songs.
p2155
aVNot really metalcore, but [Shokran] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frPjgQY6p8I) are pretty progressive and I just cant stand the cleans and sometimes not even the screams, so Im glad there is this [instrumental version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3Xd6SWFCs) of it :)
p2156
aVHoly shit, how have I never heard of this band? Started listening, haven't gotten to the vocals yet. Will edit when I get there.\u000a\u000aEdit: So far the screams are awesome, the cleans kind of remind me of BFMV, I like it. I know this post is about what band's vocals ruin it but I don't mind it.
p2157
aVAs long as you like them ;) im glad it's introduced u to them
p2158
aVIn Hearts Wake, solely because of the cleans.\u000a
p2159
aVI would probably listen to IHW if they didn't have those damn cleans.Like I said in my other post here it really just ruins the hype of the song.
p2160
aVListen to their song Survival from the album Divination. No cleans there.
p2161
aVAgreed. 
p2162
aVI kinda like the cleans, although I feel like they should have more songs without cleans. 
p2163
aVAgreed. Their first album was great with just slight cleans. New album was the opposite.
p2164
aVyup cringe worthy
p2165
aVSome (but not all) of the higher screams on I The Breather's Life:Reaper turned me off of it.\u000a\u000aEdit: also Miss May I's newer stuff
p2166
aVPeriphery. I think, instrumentally, they are some of the most talented guys out there. But for some reason I just can't get into Spencer's vocals. I only recently discovered the instrumental version of their first album, and I gotta say that I'm in love. I just don't think Spencer really fits the style they're aiming for well.
p2167
aVHave you ever heard their song Froggin' Bullfish? Give it a listen, I think it does a really good job of showcasing all of Spencer's vocals. \u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/L-AQHLFOk0Y
p2168
aVOn the first album I'd agree, but he went nuts on Juggernaut. He really killed it.
p2169
aVCannot get into Clear because of the clean vocals. 
p2170
aVDance Gavin dance because of the cleans, I love secret band and I'm cool with some cleans but there's just don't do it for me. I'll need to give it another try.\u000a\u000aAnd for no specific band but if they use heaps of pig squeals or even lots of growls I just don't enjoy it. A bit of growls every now and then is good but that's it for me
p2171
aVthe cleans are what make DGD, DGD. (and jon mess) their melodies and choruses are unforgettable. \u000a\u000awill swan's guitar playing and song writing is ridiculous.\u000a\u000afuck, the whole band is the shit
p2172
aVThat may be the case but I just don't like those style of cleans, its purely me. Will swan is a boss though haha
p2173
aVBeartooth, undoubtedly.
p2174

aVListen to the song EarthWalker. It's fucking amazing 
p2178
aVthe start is fantastic but the cleans do ruin the song
p2179
aVI don't really understand why Kyle get's so much flak, I think most of his cleans are really fitting. I mean sometimes his voice isn't really good for the dynamic of a song such as Sacred. But not to the point of ruining the song.\u000a\u000a
p2180
aVHis singing is good don't get me wrong, but the songs make you go mad and then the cleans come in and it just doesn't fit. I don't know if it's the pitch or if clean singing just doesn't fit the type of music the play. Only time it works for me is in Wildflower.
p2181
aVI find this/your name ironic, because until recently Jeremy from TDWP fits that description. 
p2182
aVThat irony is lost to me then. Yes, my account is named after a TDWP song. No i don't claim to be a fan or even like them because of that.\u000a\u000aI agree that Jeremy fits that description and it sounds awful in most songs. However he transitioned into a more natural sound with the last 2 records which i quite like. \u000a\u000aOf course that's just my opinion.

aVHYPE TRAIN, CHOO CHOO!
p2218
aVWell, seems like I was right about it being a new album
p2219
aVWell I definitely wasn't expecting a whole new album. So keen to hear it!
p2220
aVSo is all Northlane having to do with it is Marcus doing a guest spot??Still more to come hopefully...
p2221
aVtracklist says Marcus is featured on one of the songs!
p2222
aVWas really hoping for Northlane/IHW Split! But still so keen!
p2223
aVI hope the cleans aren't as bad as the last album. That's what really kept me from fully enjoying it.
p2224
aVSkydancer and Earthwalker were both recorded in a single recording session with the same producer (/u/randomawesome aka Josh Schroeder), so I imagine the cleans will be the same. I thought they were pretty good on Earthwalker to be honest.
p2225
aVYou got it. 
p2226
aVI'm really curious to know how the decision to do a two-part/double-album was made!\u000a\u000aWhen In Hearts Wake came to record with you, did they already have this all planned out and then recorded the songs for both albums and just kept the ones from Skydancer under wraps until now? Or did they come in with the intention of recording a single album, then realised they had enough good songs to turn it into this concept with two separate but connected albums?
p2227
aVThe idea was thrown around when they got here.  They had 14 or 16 songs ready, and I loved the idea of doing two records, but we only had 6 or 7 weeks... so i was like "fuck it, let's do this!"  We wrote the rest of the songs in studio and although it was a pretty grueling process, it was a lot of fun.  They're one of the hardest working bands I've ever produced, so it was a game of keep up, haha.
p2228
aVVery cool! You did an amazing job on Earthwalker, it's one of my favourite albums so I can't wait to hear Skydancer! Between the two albums, which one is your personal favourite?
p2229
aVThanks man!  I actually prefer Skydancer.  I remember when we were dividing the songs up between the two albums, I expressed concern to them that they were saving all the great tracks for the 2nd record!  No joke.
p2230
aVNow I'm interested in seeing where it goes! P.S just found the hidden lyrics in the back of the Earthwalker case
p2231
aVThere's a shot of Nick Hipa in the documentary. Ws he just helping/hanging out or did they feature him playing guitar on a song? Cause that would be dope as fuck. 
p2232
aVHe's got a guest solo, and he reminds us all who the mayor of Shred City is.
p2233
aVAnd another thing I'm curious about, was the message hidden in Northlane's Singularity (referenced [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/2wv6jb/secret_booklets_in_northlane_and_in_hearts_wake/)) connected with the Earthwalker/Skydancer project?\u000a\u000aIf so, was Marcus Bridge's part on the song Intrepid recorded recently and then added to the song that was recorded at your studio with In Hearts Wake a while ago?
p2234
aVYeah, his part was recorded right around the time "Rot" came out.  I'm not familiar with what Northlane put in their album art... I don't think it's connected to IHW.
p2235
aVWas the part that Marcus did originally going to be done by Adrian (or someone else)? I'm stoked to hear that song as Marcus is ridiculously talented, but I'm pretty sure the recording of Earthwalker/Skydancer was before the whole Northlane audition process that made Marcus more known.
p2236
aVI hope so too. I really am not a fan of the cleans they have.
p2237
aVI can't wait!
p2238
aVSo hyped for this
p2239
aVAwesome! Wasn't expecting that.
p2240
aVI had always wondered about the significance of the original Skydancer single (not the one with Vigil) in relation to the Earthwalker album, now it all makes sense.
p2241
aVPlease let it be more divination and less earthwalker
p2242
aVI think it would be so cool if the albums following Skydancer followed the same kind of format. Earthwalker, Skydancer, Firebreather?, Waterdrifter?, Buttsniffer?
p2243
aVStealthpooper
p2244
aVI can't wait for this to come out but has everyone seen the album cover? It looks straight cheesy...
p2245
aVI like it, it's a direct representation of the concept of this album.\u000a\u000aEarthwalker was about the "feminine world" or "Mother Earth" so it featured a female face as part of the earth. Skydancer is about the "masculine world" or "Father Sky" so it features a male face as part of the sky.
p2246
aVWell it's a continuation of the Earthwalker one so I can understand why it looks how it does. 
p2247
aVFrom the article posted above: "Skydancer will be released 364 days before its predecessor and will share a multitude of themes with Earthwalker across the artwork, lyrics, and charitable intentions. The two will effectively serve as two individual parts to a completed whole."
p2248
aVI'm confused, how will it be released 364 BEFORE its predecessor? That would make Skydancer its own predecessor O_o \u000a\u000aI think someone done goofed.
p2249
aVYeah they meant "after" its predecessor, definitely.

aVI don't think Issues' album will see a 2015 release. It'll probably be early 2016 (like January or February), have they even announced that they're going into the studio? 
p2260
aVThey've repeatedly stated that they intend to release a new album this year. 
p2261
aVI know they've started [pre-production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_%28band%29#Self-titled_album_and_acoustic_EP_.282013-present.29), so it's possible that it'll see a release at the tail end of the year, but I still think it won't get out till this time next year. 
p2262
aVIts only February. Even if they started recording it in late summer, it would be out by the end of the year.
p2263
aVI mean, if they started recording in may/june then maybe. If they don't get started till July/August (which I highly doubt, because they'll probably do some summer tour. Whether it be Warped again or All-Stars, or a Festival Circut) then it starts looking like an early 2016 release. If they were recording right now, or going to start soon, then yeah, probably. But it seems that they're still in the early stages of getting it all written. 
p2264
aVRecording and releasing really doesn't take that long. There are several bands that recorded in December-January and their albums are out in April. The process only takes ~4-5 months

VBeyond the Flames is in my top 5 by them.
p2291
aVI really loved In Due Time from the last album. Last time I've seen them live this was one of the few songs the crowd was actually able to sing along...
p2292
aVI really hope it's a mix of everything. Something like The Hell In Me from Disarm The Descent, My Curse from As Daylight Dies, and especially My Last Serenade from their first album. 
p2293
aVMy Last Serenade wasn't actually from their first. It's from Alive or Just Breathing, which was their second. 
p2294
aVI think I"ll be happy as long as the production, riffs, and clean sections are killer. 
p2295
aVKSE's last album was great, but I am cautiously optimistic. The guys are all getting old and I am hoping they don't regress like so many older metal bands do (please, no sequel to their 2009 self-titled). These guys are legends and I hope they are willing to try new things with this album, and prove they can continue to develop as musicians. \u000a\u000aI would also love to see Howard do a guest track on the record.
p2296
aVBeyond the Flames was my favorite by far. Such a perfect sound.
p2297
aVAnything that keeps their Godly name up. \u000a\u000aWhen I have friends who ask "What is 'metalcore'?" I instantly show them KSE. I heard a song by them by mistake (friend posted a gaming video with their Holy Diver cover as the montage music) and fell in love right away.

aVNothing that says you can't drink alone. 
p2320
aVTouche. 
p2321
aVThough, you might end up drinking to a different kind of breakdown if you're drinking alone.

aVThat was actually quite clever, I think I would generally be alright unless something happened but thats just me. 
p2323
aVThat's the spirit!
p2324
aVLiterally what me and one of my best friends call "The Breakdown Game".\u000a\u000aIt's awesome because you have the tunes to exert excessive amounts of energy and it's a game so you can get slaughtered drunk.\u000a\u000aFuck, now I want to play.

aVThe Risecore drinking game! Get all your buddies together and come up with a playlist of your favorite bands off the label and drink for every breakdown, catchy chorus, prolonged Austin Carlile scream, and dance interlude.
p2332
aVI like it. I like it a lot. Might not make it past the first song, but I like it. 
p2333
aVIf you include chuggs it would be pretty much non stop drinking haha
p2334
aVHmm this is quite interesting, ones for me that i could do in the future would be the obvious if there's a breakdown you drink (whatever you are doing it with) but then you could do some other stuff like you have to skull for the length of the breakdown or solo.\u000a\u000aOr you could shuffle just Converge and you drink for whenever you can actually work out the lyrics haha that was a terrible idea i'm just thinking of stuff with bands that i like.\u000a\u000a
p2335
aVyou wouldn't get too drunk on the second one :D

Or you can play Pierce The Veil's *Selfish Machines* and take a shot every time Vic's voice squeaks.\u000a\u000aPrepare to die of alcohol poisoning either way.\u000a\u000aEdit: Just thought of these too: take a shot every time I See Stars says conspiracy-related stuff, or listen to Falling In Reverse and take a shot every time Ronnie mentions drugs and/or the fact that he was in prison.

p2439
aVHonestly, I can't say I *don't* like this. Granted, it's not as good as their older shit, but that's kind of the point he's making.  \u000aI've actually been listening to the other singles too and it's really not as bad as most people make it out to be. I don't get how a lot of this subreddit can dig things like Wovenwar, whose change in sound from AILD I'd compare most closely with ATR's change in sound, but then turn their nose up at stuff like this. If ATR came out as a new band playing this kind of music they wouldn't receive even half the hate they are getting.  \u000aAnd so maybe it's a little more radio friendly... I'd take this playing on the radio over anything off of Restoring Force, another album that gets shit on for being radio friendly.
p2440
aV&gt; If ATR came out as a new band playing this kind of music they wouldn't receive even half the hate they are getting.\u000a\u000aTrue, ATR still has some good songs. They're just bad by comparison to their previous work. The Fall of Ideals is just such an amazing album. And in comparison to that, everything they've come up with these last 3 albums (especially the last 2) sounds incredibly boring and mediocre at best.\u000a\u000aBut the most frustrating thing is probably their entire attitude about it. They've completely sold out. "You want us to sound more like TFOI again? Yeah, fuck that. We're not going to do that. Instead, we're just going to make this album even more uninspired mainstream radio rock than the last one because $$$."

aVI liked LTAW, Divided By was definitely better, but then again LTAW was my introduction to Structures so I didn't have the expectations of them living up to Divided By
p2479
aVI loved this album, actually more so than Divided By.  The style on Divided By was dope and all, but there's just something about the way they approached LTAW that draws me in.  The vocals never bothered me like they did for a lot of people.  I thought it was a great album

p2491
aVInstrumentally, they're still pretty good, but the "screams" are definitely getting terrible, the cleans are still pretty good though, at this point it would make a lot more sense to just get someone else to scream for them, and have Garrett just do cleans

p2504
aVActually yes, I've noticed quite a bit of Converge jerking, especially from you, not saying it's bad, but it's a bit hypocritical after you complain about other bands you don't like as much being jerked
p2505
aVokay let's split some hairs then\u000a\u000a[ABR search results](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/search?q=august+burns+red&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all#page=1)\u000a\u000a[Converge search results](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/search?q=converge&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)\u000a\u000athe highest rated ABR post is sitting at 367 points (169 for a song). The first 25 posts are all at over 100 upvotes.\u000a\u000athe highest rated Converge song is at a whopping 79. The first 25 posts all have UNDER 100 upvotes.\u000a\u000athat's not taking into account that the quality of Converge discussions is usually less masturbatory than ABR/PWD love, which anyone who frequents this sub can easily tell you\u000a\u000aso in conclusion, no. There is no converge jerk. You just want to call me out. Run along now
p2506
aVI think a lot of it is that I got here after a lot of the really bad ABR circlejerking, so I didn't realize how bad it was and unintentionally contributed a lot to it, after looking through some of those search results, I definitely see what you mean, while I like ABR quite a bit, I agree that a lot of what's said about them in this sub (including some of my past comments) is pretty ridiculous, my apologies, I've only been involved with this sub, and Reddit in general, for about 5 months, so I'm still relatively new, I've been trying to do a lot less ABR jerking recently, and now I'm only mentioning them in threads where it actually makes sense for me to talk about them
p2507
aVIt seems that Converge has only got more popular in this sub recently, like there used to be a time when like no one had this flair
p2508
aVThat makes sense then, since while I've been here, especially recently, I've seen about as much Converge stuff as ABR stuff
p2509
aVIn the last month two Converge songs have been posted and one is a drumcam video, and both had under 20 upvotes

aVLike already said, Impericon. I don't know if they still have them but about half a year a ago I bought a 10-posters pack. Including bands like Parkway Drive, Architects, Whitechapel, Memphis May Fire... Bought it when they had a promotion that you didn't have too pay any shipping costs so I had 10 posters for only 2 euros.

If you feel the energy hop in the pit(if you've never been in a pit, look up pit etiqeutte) \u000a\u000aIf you want to mark out and sing along hit the front, but beware, you'll get pushed against the stage/barricade and it might hurt.\u000a\u000aWatch out for stage divers and crowd surfers.\u000a\u000aReally about it.\u000a\u000a68 is REALLY fun live, I'm not a big BAAO or TAA fan, but I'm going to guess a lot of girls/people who aren't as crazy will be there.

aVThanks for the feedback man!
p2552
aVyou want to get to the venue early. like super early. somewhere around sound check is when the hardcore fans show up, so they can all impress each other by saying "oooh sounds like they're playing _____ tonight" or "wow that is a new riff, we might hear something from their next album tonight."\u000a\u000athe guitarist, or at least the bassist, will come out at some point to smoke a cigarette. they will sign things for the hardcore fans, maybe answer some questions. this is your entry point. this is where you gush and get excited and make it very clear how ready you are to suck some dick. you may get invited backstage at this point, or to watch the show from backstage (this is unlikely though).\u000a\u000amore likely is that they will flirt with you a bit but damn man, they got a job to do. but-- you made an impression and will be one of the first through the door. you take this opportunity to post up right in front of the guitar amps. then you flirt all show long, not over the top hollering stuff, but throw some sexy faces his way when he's doing crowd service. when he's soloing, he's not paying attention to you, he's busy. but when he's just chugging along, keeping it going for his bandmates while they go nuts, that's when he has time to pay attention to you and how excited you are to suck his dick.\u000a\u000ait is after the concert his sound tech or security will be instructed to grab whoever and bring them backstage after the show. stick around at the front-- that's when the usual fans are asking for set lists and begging to be let back stage. either you will be asked if you did your job well, or you should ask the manager/ sound guys taking the stage apart. it's important you distinguish the venue's security and tech guys from the bands. it will be obvious. make sure to focus on the bands, the venue guys just want you gone so they can go home.\u000a\u000anow, let's assume it hasn't happened yet. that's fine. you want to hang out wherever the band was around the sound check cigarette. it won't be the regular entrance/ exit, it will be on the side or back of the building. they are expecting this, as well, people asking them to sign stuff or want to share with them how important their music is and stuff. this is the most likely chance to get on the bus-- their job is over, they recognize your "fuck me" eyes from the show, they are headed to the bus and ready to blow off some steam. don't ask them to sign anything, just be there, hot, and ready.\u000a\u000ai want to be clear-- if they don't invite you backstage at sound check, do not despair. if they don't have their security bring you back during/after the show, don't give up. most common and easiest is when they are leaving the venue, maybe 30 minutes after the show is over and 95% of the crowd is gone. this is the groupie's time to shine.\u000a\u000aalso-- because i am assuming you have completed your task-- make it clear you have 0 obligations and would be happy to head to the next town with them. after you suck dick, not before, you don't want to appear cling-y. but to really be a groupie, you need to get on that bus to the next town. do your thing well and make it clear you're open to leavingt with them the next morning. once you are on the bus off to yuma or ... bakersfield, then you are truly a groupie.\u000a\u000abe safe out there sister.\u000a

aVIf you mosh or stage dive or do something active, make sure to drink LOTS of water otherwise you will likely get quite dehydrated and possibly pass out and if you take your phone find a safe place to store if you mosh or stage dive as you could likely lose it or it'd get destroyed. That being said at my local gigs I keep it in my pocket, but if you have a back up / bad phone you could use that so it doesn't get destroyed
p2558
aVMan I wanted to keep my phone with me, what do you mean by a safe place? I trust no one.
p2559
aVYou give it to your friend when you the pit? i haven't been to a big concert in awhile but some local ones they can look after, your phone. 
p2560
aVAh good point. Thanks!
p2561
aVif you don't have to take your phone thats better but quite often that can't happen
p2562
aVIf you stand near the pit, you are going to get hit. It's not a maybe, it is a fact. Usually it's accidental, sometimes it's intentional. It's okay. Don't hit back, even if it's on purpose. Typically anyone who goes out of their way to hit someone intentionally is affiliated with a local crew and him and his ass-hole friends will beat the shit out of you if you fight back. Just let it go, or stay away from the pit. Security usually will keep you safe at most decent venues.

aVYeah...it fades into an edited feedback noise...
p2634
aVso much agree
p2635
aVDave Hunt/VITRIOL is probably my favorite vocalist in all of metal when it comes to just straight screaming. There's very few others that come close to him in terms of volume, anger, and just pure malice that he spews into the mic. What's even crazier than that though is the fact that he can rip his vocal cords out like this and still go back and have semi-cleans that still have some range and depth to them. That and [then they bust out songs in Latin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySsJPV9RLSQ).\u000a\u000aI wanna see them live at some point but they never/rarely ever come to the US, and if they do, only east coast :(

aVMicah Kinard is really quite amazing. One of the incredible things about the album "Children of Fire" is that most of the songs had only done one take for vocals. (just what I've heard through the grapevine, please correct me if I'm wrong)

aVI won't say it's the best, but that scream on Entombment Of A Machine by jfac 
p2653
aVI notice the discussion tending towards [the longest screams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNSpeKpGGTg) in metalcore. But, if we're talking about best-sounding vocal ever, not necessarily accounting for skill (because there's a fair bit of production magic done on it), then look no further than [this wall of throat sound](http://youtu.be/C0D9Mqb86lI?t=3m8s).
p2654
aVWhatever it is it won't be in a metalcore song.
p2655
aVWell who has the best scream in the metalcore genre
p2656
aVThere's a couple viable answers, Jake Leurs, Oli Sykes (I apologize if I'm spelling these wrong). I'm my personal opinion though,  Caleb Shomo, if you haven't listened to his scream look up I have a problem it's pretty incredible
p2657
aV&gt; Leurs\u000a\u000aLuhrs. Close enough though. 
p2658
aVThose three wouldn't be anywhere near the best vocalists IMO
p2659
aVWell that's why it's subjective man. There's obviously no one answer to a question like  that. But to back up my selection the reason I like Shomo is because imo he has a great scream as well as being able to hit notes while singing that most metalcore vocalists sound like a whiny girl while singing and yet he still has a manly edge to his voice. Not to mention he writes and produces all of his own music. I know that shouldn't necessarily fall in his favor in a vocalist argument but as a produces and songwriter myself I really respect him for it. 
p2660
aVUnfortunately, I saw Beartooth with Silverstein 2 days ago and Caleb sounded AWFUL. He's completely destroyed his voice and didn't even scream half the words in his songs. He'd either let the crowd sing them or literally just speak them in longer vocal runs.
p2661
aVStrange, I've seen both bands 3 times and he sounded fine, granted the last time was nearly a year ago. Speaking of silverstein, how bout shane told? I wouldn't necessarily add him to a list of the best but that guy has been so consistent for so long. 
p2662
aVYeah. I saw him at Warped this past year and he sounded great. Maybe he was having an off night, but I think it might be more than that. And Silverstein is and has been my favorite band for a very long time now so of course I'm going to say he sounded fan-fucking-tastic. Closed the show with an acoustic of Call it Karma... it was amazing.
p2663
aVDamn that's awesome.  They will always be in my top 5 simply because they don't feel the need to "evolve" or some bullshit like every other band. They know what they're good at so they do it, and you can depend on every album to be solid and have at least 6-7 good songs.
p2664
aVI did say IMO like we have different tastes and that's cool. There was no reason for my comment haha I think I just felt obliged to counter your argument, sorry dude.\u000a\u000aOn the talk of hitting notes, Greg Pucito from the Dillinger escape does it amazingly while screaming like a mad man
p2665
aVwell man, it looks like we agree on something\u000a\u000aalso nice flair
p2666
aVThanks x2
p2667
aVIf you're going endurance wise, Telle Smith can belt a solid 30 seconds to a minute of a constant scream. Last warped tour he held a scream for a good minute. 
p2668
aVTelle in my opinion is one of the best vocalists around. He's so good. 
p2669
aVThe entire band has some great talent, but for some reason they're studio stuff always comes up short and kinda meh.
p2670
aVDude I know exactly what you're talking about. Telle, Zach, Tony, Daniel, and especially Luke have INCREDIBLE talent on their respective instruments, but everything they've put out after Deceiver has been so mediocre. \u000a\u000aThey still kick ass live though even if they're newer music is pretty meh.
p2671
aVIt's because of fucking Cameron Mizell
p2672
aVI disagree Life cycles was produced by Joey Sturgis yet that album was nothing but chug chug chug melodic singing anthem heavy chug maybe one or two solos and then more chugs. Theres some hate for Mizell on this subreddit but i can honestly say as a fan of TWA since Craig was in the band that the reason the music is meh now solely lies with the band. 
p2673
aVYou think? I think it's pretty awesome. Everything of theirs that I've listened to has been sorta meh at first, but it all grows on me massively. 
p2674
aVWith most metalcore bands the product is greater than the sum of its parts or however that saying goes. Opposite is true for TWA.
p2675
aVHonestly, I think Telle is one of the best overall vocalist in the genre. His screams are fucking killer, and his cleans are pretty awesome. Most bands that have 1 scream/singer usually lacks in one of those departments live, but Telle kills both clean and unclean vocals live.\u000a\u000aObviously there are quite a few clean vocalist and unclean vocalist that are more talented, but I'm talking overall.
p2676
aVCame here to say this. Saw them live on their recent tour and he held that outro scream on Broken Circuit for about three times as long as it lasts on the record. It was the most unreal vocal performance I think I've seen live. \u000a\u000aReally reminds me of Chester Bennington crushing that huge twenty second scream on Given Up.

aVUpvotes for CI. Several really good bands on their label that could use some more exposure. 
p2715
aVI've especially been liking Que Sera
p2716
aVMy personal favorite is One Year Later. Love their newest record, they're sick live, and are super nice dudes. Also a big up to Carousel Kings, their new CD is killer too.
p2717
aVI didn't really like One Year Later that much, and I haven't gotten around to listening to Carousel Kings yet
p2718
aVCarousel Kings are great. Them and Alive in Standby are sort of leading the charge of the "TR00 Easycore" movement, though I highly doubt it's gonna gain as much momentum as Easycore originally did. CNCC are possibly jumping on that bandwagon since they want to be more serious so who knows, it may be a thing.
p2719
aVI dunno if CK is leading the movement, but they are definitely a part of it. They only get a few thousand views on their songs on YouTube, which is why I don't see them as being very big yet. I do hope they get there though, though!
p2720
aVWell to be fair, there really aren't that many other bands that come to mind. Who do you think is leading the charge?
p2721
aVTo me, if we aren't counting ADTR, Four Year Strong and CnCC. 
p2722
aVOk, FYS I can agree that their latest EP was very "tr00", but CNCC (at least not yet) aren't really serious, which is the whole point. They did say they wanted to be serious, but as of right now, I wouldn't call them "tr00". Another borderline one I would have said is Me Vs. Hero, but they just broke up so....
p2723
aVAh, I see, not really my thing though
p2724
aVAwesome thanks.
p2725
aVLol how did you have a falling-out with record labels while researching them? What are you even trying to find out? Labels aren't some secret society or government organization, information about them is readily available. 
p2726
aVI used to really like Victory but once I heard about ADTR and apparently some other bands and the legalities I stopped supporting those labels. Sumerian was the same and after all the stuff with Miss Fortune I'm kinda sketched out by them. Looking for studios that id like to try and work for but I prefer to narrow down my job applications to studios that aren't like Victory. 
p2727
aVMiss Fortune got dropped because the vocalist got charger with domestic violence, they earned the drop. I work for various labels as a sort of "contracter" on tours and at shows and can tell you right now that SO many people want jobs for them and you will be lucky to work for any of them at all, so don't get picky.
p2728
aVThe charges were dropped though. I, like a lot of others, think the situation was handled poorly. They overreacted before learning the full details of what happened. Plus, you have that whole mess with UABB, so that label seems super sketchy
p2729
aVThats what im thinking.
p2730
aVBut he was found innocent. I know I shouldn't but i just dont like how some of them are. 
p2731
aVThere's a Ska band called Streetlight Manifesto who had similar dealings with Victory and their owner who is generally just not a nice guy.
p2732
aVDeathwish Inc. is Jacob Bannon's (Vocalist of Converge) record label based out of Massachusetts I'm fairly certain.

p2757
aVI personally think the older the better with MMI
p2758
aVFor me it's Monument, Apologies/ROTL are even, At Heart. While apologies was heavier, with a few exceptions I thought the songs weren't as interestingly written as the later stuff, though the majority of At Heart was a bit boring. ROTL would be right up with Monument for me if it wasn't for Levi's vocals
p2759
aVIts funny because everyone says how his vocals were destroyed up til making the most recent album. I saw them live on the frozen flame tour and i think he sounded great with old stuff. so i just don't know anymore. 
p2760
aVI agree, I think the issue was mostly the production on the album
p2761
aVThe new album has some good songs, but as an album monument was better imo

It's amazing really

p2781
aVWell with how many terrible bands in the genre, for modern metalcore it possibly could be, as I'm sure its influenced far too many bands
p2782
aVit influenced a lot of the music that's called generic right now haha, it might not be super unique and groundbreaking, but you can't say they got as big as they are for no reason.
p2783
aVNot really, it did kind of set the tone for metalcore. Modern metalcore has come a long way since Stand Up and Scream though.
p2784
aVDon't insult AA man. All the scene kids on this sub get butthurt. 
p2785
aVThis was always my favorite song of theirs.
p2786
aVAA get's alot of shit, and they deserve it because of what Danny did to that band. However, Stand Up and Scream set alot of current techniques in this genre, breakdown filled songs, guitar chugs. SY&amp;S had it all, at the time it came out it was fucking amazing. Sure, now, it may seem boring and generic, but back then and when you hold it to that standard, it was awesome.

p2809
aVi feel that jesse's cleans have progressed immensely because of ghost atlas, and that's why moments of clarity has such great cleans.  i do greatly miss garrison's highs and alan's melodic guitar parts
p2810
aVFor some reason I was honestly worried that Jesse's vocals would suffer, or at least that he wouldn't sing as high as he had on Augment and before. But thankfully that was laid to rest when I heard Dreamcatcher.

p2833
(lp2834
VI absolutely love how Garrett breaks down the lyrics behind his songs, I still remember when I first discovered them through a friend of mine, of course they're signed to Solid State, but on the description of each video is references to the bible, or history about what each line and phrase in a song means, it really blew my mind on the thought they put into it.\u000a\u000aAs for Garrett himself, I really like his view on things, and it amazes me that he's so open things. In a day where things are marked NSFC (Not safe for Christians) because of lyrics and feelings, I only wish more people / musicians took a step out and expressed themself like Silent Planet does, and not hide behind their spirituality and use it as a shield, as well as not using it as an excuse to hurt others. but instead use it as a tool to try spreading some love, the word, and a way of life (following Jesus) albeit in a unique way.\u000a\u000aLooking forward to seeing the future of Silent Planet.
p2835
aV&gt; In a day where things are marked NSFC (Not safe for Christians)\u000a\u000aI'm like 99% sure those tags are just a joke. I don't think I've seen anyone get seriously offended by stuff like BMTH or Architects on this sub.
p2836
aVYeah it's a joke making fun of the people that legitimately get offended.
p2837
aVI do agree,  I myself do love Architects and BMTH so I'm obviously biased and will admit that, but then again I'd like to think you can see a bit of where I'm coming from, as a Christian it annoys me to no end when I see others getting so easily offended from music, or feelings behind songs, because they represent part of who we are as a community (Christians, I myself at least).\u000a\u000aI just don't like how the minority makes us all look bad I suppose is what I'm trying to say. people need to learn to look past solely lyrics or an artists background, and just enjoy music for what it is sometimes, entertainment and enjoyment through an artist.
p2838
aVThis is fascinating. Every time I listen to that album I find myself caring less about the music (which is great and all) and more about the lyrics. These guys blew my mind and continue to do so knowing how much is packing into the writing. Thanks for posting.
p2839
aVDang he touched on a lot of different subjects. All very interesting, all well written, with a good message behind each one.
p2840
aVTwo things:\u000a\u000a1. I wish to strangle who ever edited that video, so many cuts and fading to white. Ugggg.\u000a\u000a2. I cannot even put words to how much respect I have for that band and Garrett in particular. Silent Planet is one of the few bands proving that you can make heavy af music without completely throwing out musicianship and lyricism. The way that he references so many different works, but not so many that it seems that he isn't writing anything new, just blows my mind.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say I cannot wait until they come to my town and/or put out new music.
p2841
aVReally interesting. I've listened to this album so many times I've kind of made my own interpretations of the songs, so it was interesting to see the meaning behind each of them. \u000a\u000aAlso met Garrett at a show a few weeks ago and he was a super cool guy, which makes me like their music even more. 
p2842

p2862
aVUgh, The Story So Far isn't going to be there but they have another show in my town like a week later. 
p2863
aVThis year's is one of the worst lineups ever, but there's a LOT of good bands to go see. Moose Blood, Hundredth, '68, Grey Gordon, The Wonder Years/Aaron West, Fit For A King, Have Mercy, I Killed The Prom Queen, Major League, Riff Raff and Sirens &amp; Sailors are all great, plus there's a couple more announcements to be made. We haven't thought about some bands that are yet to be announced that are possibilities:\u000a\u000a1. Miss May I - pretty sure someone posted a thread on here a short time ago saying they'd confirmed they'd be on the tour.\u000a\u000a2. Northlane - a good test to see how Marcus fares over here on a long tour, plus they have new music coming out.\u000a\u000a3. Dance Gavin Dance - they have a new album coming out in April and no announced touring plans after early May. They've got name recognition and could draw crowds. \u000a\u000aSo let's not write this tour off just yet. It really isn't that bad.
p2864
aVIf DGD goes that definitely confirms on going this year
p2865
aVEven if dgd does go, I'd rather pay $40 for a vip ticket for them, stolas, polyphia, and hail the sun in April. Fuck warped this year. 
p2866
aVNorthlane unfortunately said they aren't playing
p2867
aVseriously? that sucks. they'd work so well on this year's tour.
p2868
aVI completely agree, seems like they're playing festivals in Europe instead though
p2869
aVI also have think that Ice Nine Kills and Crown the Empire will probably join on. CTE made a couple of posts the other day on Facebook reminiscing on warped.
p2870
aVNah.  \u000a\u000aI've seen btf and taa already, only other band I'd want to see is baao
p2871
aVBut '68 though
p2872
aVBaao is pretty gr8
p2873
aVNope. This year is shit. Excited for Mayhem though. 
p2874
aVAnd Summer Slaughter for me 
p2875
aVIt never comes anywhere near me, but if the rumors of Dahlia playing are true I'm driving somewhere.
p2876
aVWhy Mayhem? Do we know anything yet? I saw Linkin Park was a rumored headliner which I'd be fine with, but a lot of people would freak out.
p2877
aVYes, but I can see why people who mainly listen to metalcore might not be yet. With bands like Hundredth, Being As An Ocean, '68, The Amity Affliction &amp; Handguns though, I'm excited. Also don't count out the lineup until its fully announced, something might catch your eye soon!
p2878
aVNo, not yet at least. Hopefully The All Stars Tour will have a good lineup this year though.
p2879
aVI also agree that the line-up is far less stellar than last year. I don't know if they are holding back on the announcements, or just dropped the ball on us. I haven't been as excited after an announcement since the first week, Neck Deep and Palisades. But to piggyback /u/moshlyfe, there could still be some announcements that could sway more people into going:  \u000a* Oceans Ate Alaska - they just released their first record through Fearless and have received lots of praise (from at least what I've seen in the community)  \u000a* Myka, Relocate - another great choice that aren't touring in the near future, but also are recording / finishing recording  \u000a* For The Win - (if you can get past their name) a fantastic pop-punk band that put out an album with Artery but are almost being ignored. Very little touring with even less promotion. I think Warped would be a saving grace for this band with so many pop-punk bands being there. I feel the label should have forced them onto us like Fearless did with As It Is.  \u000aI know these are not huge names, but any one of these would guarantee my trip.
p2880
aVI think we were all kinda spoiled by last year. There was an insane amount of good bands. This year isn't as good, but there's still enough bands I like for me to be excited. Asking Alexandria, Blessthefall, Crossfaith, Escape the Fate (not as excited, I'd rather have Dead Rabbitts), Fit For A King, Hundredth, IKTPQ, Icon For Hire, Sirens and Sailors, and The Amity Affliction. That's a lot of good bands for one day. Plus there's still more announcements, so we might get a couple more good bands.
p2881
aVI'd much rather The Dead Rabbitts too. I thought I heard something going around a few months ago about TDR playing warped, but then ETF got announced and then I got sad. 
p2882
aVMaybe Craig might try double duty? It'd probably be stupid, but you never know.
p2883
aVDouble duty on warped tour just seems like a sick joke to play on yourself. \u000a\u000aThough, Scout from Issues kinda did it last year. 
p2884
aVYeah, but it's a little easier for a DJ. I wouldn't want to do that to my throat.
p2885
aVI really don't know what the idea is behind the announcements. You think if you're gonna do weekly announcements it'd be so you could fit two big namers in with your small timers every week so people feel a need to check back. But this year it's more like 1 big name every 3 weeks and the in between time is just Bryan Stars reading facebook band profiles off his phone for shitty pop or electronica artists who nobody wants to see or will. The worst part is I honestly feel it's dehyped warp imagine if they did like montly announcments for big timers so 1 month they announce Blessthefall, Escape the Fate, and Neck Deep. That'd look really cool and give a reason to check back on announcements but no we just get disappointing week by week action.
p2886
aVI'm still going this year regardless. There are a couple bands I really enjoy, but my friend and I go every year regardless of the line up. He's not even a metalcore fan either. He goes with hardly any knowledge of the line up and just watches whatever and has a blast. 
p2887
aVI just want to see Hundredth so badly that I might go 
p2888
aVAre the Road To Warped bands going to be playing regular Warped? Because if so I'll be a lot happier with it. 
p2889
aVThere are some pretty good bands this year, just not metalcore ones. And I'm not spending that kinda money to go see 2 or 3 metalcore bands. 
p2890
aVMetalcore bands on Warped 2015 (so far): Asking Alexandria, Blessthfall, Crossfaith, Fit For A King, I Killed the Prom Queen, The Amity Affliction, Sirens and Sailors, and While She Sleeps.
p2891
aVShould clarify:\u000a\u000a2 or 3 metalcore bands I'm interested in or who are worth seeing live for $40. 
p2892
aVSo far I'm liking it about as much as last year, though I'm still hoping some more good bands get announced. This year I'm looking forward to Fit For a King, Blessthefall, Hundredth, and Being as an Ocean. Last year the only bands I was really into were Crown the Empire, Born of Osiris, Beartooth, and The Story So Far. I'm still hoping for a lineup I liked as much as 2013, where there were a lot of bands I liked, but so far no luck.
p2893
aVSo you didn't see INK, TDWP, Chelsea Grin, Parkway Drive, etc last year?
p2894
aVI saw Ice Nine Kills while I was waiting for Born of Osiris, but I'm not really a fan of any of them
p2895
aVBeartooth is gonna play.

aVBlessthefall (Would go just for them), Crossfaith, FFAK, Our Last Night, and the Amity Affliction.\u000a\u000aPlus some others that I wouldn't pay to see but I would definitely watch like ETF, Hands like House, and AA.
p2899
aVIm pretty stoked. I get to finally see Our Last Night and Amity Affliction. And Asking Alexandria. Also I hear I Killed he Prom Queen is god so I'll probably catch their set. \u000aOh, and Set It Off will be there, and I dig their stuff so I'll probably see them too.
p2900
aVNot sure anything can beat last year's, though. I got to see CTE, OM&amp;M, Attila, Issues, ADTR, Chelsea Grin, TWA, FATS (for a second).
p2901
aVHundredth, Being As An Ocean, The Amity Affliction, The Wonder Years and Rotting Out should be enough to get anyone to go. Hell, maybe even Asking Alexandria to see their new vocalist.

asVLast Year's Tragedy - Generation Light (Official Video) Metalcore from Nairobi.
p2903
(lp2904
VDude I love this for so many reasons. First of all there is a scene in Kenya and that is something I never imagined there would be.\u000a\u000aSecond of all this totally reminds me of how bands used to be where I live circa 08/09. Catching the train to places two hours away to see bands just like this with a bunch of friends from high school every weekend, this sends me on a massive nostalgia trip.\u000a\u000aI love the style, no one plays stuff like this any more. Swirling strings as synth instead of just typical pop melodies like these days, just straight up chugs for breakdowns, no "djent" bullshit. tremolo picking with double kicks, old school cross picking in the verses, some one actually screaming on vocals instead of being worried about their "inhale fries" and "gutteral lows" or what ever the fuck\u000a\u000a10/10 fuck yeah. 
p2905
aVThat's funny- I'm fifty and a buddy of mine who I played in punk bands with BITD said to me, "I bet playing there is just like it was back in 1980." 
p2906
aVI would love to see how a show actually goes down there. I imagine it would be so far removed from anywhere with more developed "core" communities... or it is exactly the same and I'm just ignorant as fuck.
p2907
aVI have some friends down there (David Karuga from Last YEar's Tragedy being one of them) and they have a growing middle class in Nairobi, and I do know that guys from Uganda fly to Nairobi for skate contests- so that alone broke me out of my paradigm of where Nairobi is right now culturally.

aVMemory Of You clearly one of the best tracks imo.
p2912
aVIt was also on the last album
p2913
aVNow that you say it... :D I just got into them when I saw some songs from them in this subreddit.  \u000ae/ still a friggin good song
p2914
aVThey have three albums, and all of them are freaking *awesome*
p2915
aVSadly Spotify only has 2 of them up. Gotta check out the third one later then, thanks.
p2916
aVwhy did they put it on this one as well?
p2917
aV[deleted]
p2918
aVAnd it's fantastic
p2919
aVFucking heavy! I love it
p2920
aVI was on top of this the night it dropped.  This whole album is fire&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
p2921
aVIt's been available since it's release last Tuesday 
p2922
aVYeah I also had it in Spotify since Sunday, but I thought most people didn't know yet and why not share the awesome stuff? 
p2923
aVWasn't for me.
p2924
aVThat's weird. I woke up for work at 6am last week Tuesday and I've had it ever since. 
p2925
aVYeah I started last week listening to this (US here), maybe Plasticninja is in Canada?
p2926
aVOh! That could be it, US here as well so maybe it was just delayed in other parts of the world. Good Thinking!

p2930
aVexcept for We Are Harlot
p2931
aVTruth.
p2932
aVDefinitely my favorite off this album.  Didn't know Worsnop was in this until December...
p2933
aVOne of I See Stars' all-time greatest songs, and on top of that, one of Danny's coolest vocal segments.

aVI agree, this is awful....I'm from Michigan, and I like some of I See Star's songs, but this is straight trash....
p2939
aVBecause where you're from totally plays a part in your distaste of the song...
p2940
aVno, but they're from Michigan and I do have a special place in my heart for them because they're from a place very close to me, (within 30 mins of my house.) This song is just not very good IMO.

asVWhat's Your Favorite "Slow Song"/Acoustic/Ballad/Etc From Your Favorite Metalcore Band?
p2942
(lp2943
VThe Devil Wears Prada - Louder Than Thunder
p2944
aV[deleted]
p2945
aVNot really metalcore, but I'd have to say Silverstein and ADTR have the best acoustics and slower songs. One of my "new" favorites is "End Of Me" by ADTR. Lyrics hit home big time. 
p2946
aVTo Live and to Lose by Silverstein is just such a fantastic song
p2947
aVBetraying The Martyrs - Azalee 
p2948
aVEither Blessed with a Curse(Sorta slow), or 15 Fathoms, Counting by Bring me the Horizon.
p2949
aVTDWP. Kansas is my favorite but care more and louder than thunder are awesome as well
p2950
aVKansas is amazing! First time I heard that song it blew my mind :D
p2951
aVIt's extremely fun to play on guitar too. It's no wonder why they go crazy when they play it! 
p2952
aVOne of Us Is The Killer by TDEP it's up there.
p2953
aVThe Nine Inch Escape Plan
p2954
aVBeing as an ocean "The hardest part is forgetting those you swore you would never forget"\u000aSuchhh a good song.
p2955
aVFuck yes
p2956
aVMore Than You Know - Adestria
p2957
aVRelief by Bury Tomorrow is great. 
p2958
aV100% agree! That album is amazing altogether, but that one song always hit me in my core
p2959
aVBury tomorrow has so many songs like that! My favorite is The Watcher v2
p2960
aVI'm not sure if this counts, but The River by Parkway Drive
p2961
aVOf course it does! This song is amazing. 
p2962
aVNot favorite band, but Priestess by Periphery is probably the best ballad I've ever heard.  
p2963
aVBoth albums have really grown on me over the past few days, it gets better each time you listen to it.
p2964
aVDillinger Escape Plan - One of Us is the Killer\u000a\u000aHe Is Legend - China White III\u000a\u000aBeloved - Allure\u000a\u000aOf Mice &amp; Men - My Understandings\u000a\u000a
p2965
aVHollow Crown
p2966
aV Satellites by Crown The Empire just has such an epic ballad-y feel about it. 
p2967
aVJohnny Truant - Footprints in the Thunder\u000a\u000aHaste the Day - Labyrinth 
p2968
aVIts not super slow but Don't Go by BMTH is depressingly awesome. Also Means to Believe by Oh, sleeper I've always dug.
p2969
aVAsking Alexandria - Someone, Somewhere acoustic version \u000aEdit: Ben Bruce version
p2970
aVDefinitely Carpe Diem by August Burns Red, amazing live too
p2971
aVJust saw ABR in concert, and Meridian is still an amazing song
p2972
aVThis, this, and this. Meridian is probably one of my favorite songs of all time. Good call. 
p2973
aVI like Carpe Diem more but they're both amazing. 
p2974
aVI like carpe diem is less of an instrumental song, but I guess it is still relatively slow... awesome song either way
p2975
aVI never really liked The Color Morale, but Inertia by In Hearts Wake with Garrett is a really good slow song 
p2976
aVWoe, is me's acoustic version of Nothing Left To Loose is quite good.
p2977
aVDemon Hunter has plenty - [Deteriorate,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rY4qbma9ls) [My Throat Is An Open Grave,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlunKJrCRvo) [Carry Me Down,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2-RHFJ2Vmg) and [I Play Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8GAZpvbwNo), just to name a few.  There's always at least one on each album.
p2978
aVBlessthefall - With eyes wide shut.
p2979
aVHaste the Day- Autumn 
p2980
aVAstral Plane- The Word Alive
p2981
aVnot metalcore but silversteins this is how the wind shifts made me cry
p2982
aVThat entire album is amazing. I love to sing "One Last Dance" at the top of my lungs until I'm blue in the face. \u000a\u000aShit is just perfect for a situation between me and my last female, who I was supposed to marry. \u000a\u000aSeeing them next weekend on Valentines Day... So stoked. 
p2983
aVyeah it seriously one of my favorite albums ever. Seeing hem on the 22nd cant wait.
p2984
aVBen Bruce's acoustic of "Someone, Somewhere".
p2985
aVNot metalcore, but Code Orange has a song called Dreams in Inertia which is really slow and gets incredibly trudgy at the end.  Much different from most of their other material, but it's probably my favorite song by them.\u000a\u000a[linky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Etw4OJ6c8)
p2986
aVNorthlane-Singularity. That Terence Mckenna excerpt is incredibly moving.
p2987
aVAtreyu- Wait For You
p2988
aVNot sure if Metalcore, but Mood Ring - Ghost Atlas, sadly I get depressed as fuck everytime I listen to it
p2989
aVThe fact that Meridian was only mentioned once is really surprising to me, definitely an amazing song and even more amazing that they wrote it when they were somewhat early in their career as opposed to the band they have grown into now. \u000a\u000aAlso, one of us is the killer by the Dillinger escape plan, not exactly a fan of them but that song is really good. 
p2990

p2998
aVyeah its really a classic one that everyone should have in his music library!
p2999
aVWait, this band used to not suck?
p3000
aVI'm one of the few people on this sub that also likes their new stuff, but their old stuff's great, if you like this, you'll probably enjoy the whole Monument album, and maybe their album Apologies are For the Weak
p3001
aVI didn't know people hated new Miss May I. Rise of the lion isn't my favorite but I don't find it bad.
p3002
aVThe new stuff just isn't that popular on this sub\u000a\u000aFor me it's: \u000a\u000aRise of the Lion\u000a\u000aMonument\u000a\u000aApologies are For the Weak\u000a\u000aAt Heart
p3003
aVI think rise of the lion is one of their best works tbh.
p3004
aVI actually agree with you
p3005
aVI wish thy played this song live when I saw them with ABR
p3006
aVI'm just glad they played Our Kings
p3007
aVi want them to come to germany, they are one of the very few bands that i yet have to see live.

p3020
aVHow does he feel about the band's musical progression and seeing his bandmates grow as musicians over the years since they were teenagers?

p3023
(lp3024
VDogs Can, Grow Beards All, Over, by William, Shatner.\u000a\u000aBut in all seriousness I was just listening to this earlier today. Good stuff, and the video reminds me of a simpler time in Metalcore. Damn, now I'm getting all teared up.

aVONE DAY they will play this again. and i will lose my mind
p3030
aVThey played it a few years ago at warped along with zombie in its entirety. I shit pants
p3031
aVI really miss the mixes on these old records. The drums hit. The guitars are crispity crunchy. Mike's vox come through. You can hear each instrument. The drums on Roots/Branches felt dead and Mike gets lost in the mix on Dead Throne sometimes. 
p3032
aVWow I've never heard of this band. Pretty sick stuff here, are they new around the scene? They definitely know how to screamo 
p3033
aVthey've been around since before 2006 (when i got into them and plagues came out)
p3034
aVI was just being an idiot haha! I know who they are
p3035
aVoh alright. cheers!
p3036
aVthat fucking bass slide \u000a\u000aeasily my favorite thing about this song. i'm waiting for the day they finally play this song again live. ^and^still^fly^too^pls
p3037
aVhave they finally stopped playing it live? i think i've potentially seen TDWP more than any other band and every time their set finished with Dogs.\u000a\u000aThat said, i think i've only seen them once since the release of Dead Throne. I'm not really a fan of where they've taken their sound since.
p3038
aVI don't understand the appeal of old TDWP. Like, can anyone specifically tell me what they like about the song, particularly the parts between 0:59 - 1:34? I can't imagine anyone who is into metalcore liking that.
p3039
aVit's unique, and you can't really generalize people that way, 2 people can both like metalcore but not like the same bands because they like different styles of metalcore.
p3040
aVI love metalcore but old tdwp is best tdwp for me. I really like the part you listed cause the deep screams are unique and it has a cool best you don't ordinarily hear. Mikes voice reminds me of Dennis Lee (alesana) another favorite screamer of mine. 
p3041
aVThis was o w of the first metalcore songs that I had ever listened to and that part in the song that you specifically mention is what got me hooked. That part is pretty damn ruthless. Those lows, man, those looooows.
p3042
aVDo you think it's too heavy for metalcore fans? Otherwise I don't really know what you mean.
p3043
aVI suppose you could say that. It just sounds like messy grindcore with less brutal vocals to me.
p3044
aVhaha that's what a lot of old school metalcore like old ABR kinda sounds like
p3045
aVGreat song! My band covers this song. It's always a fun one for the audience !
p3046
aVwhale cum\u000a\u000ato\u000a\u000athe\u000a\u000awhore
p3047
aVNothing makes me happier than the fact that they moved on from this poorly written, juvenile stuff. Good for them.
p3048
aVNah man, this was the golden ages of TDWP. The newer stuff(post zombie ep) just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
p3049
aVbesides they were really young when they wrote this.. people hate on the older stuff but most of it is what led us to what we have today.

aVTotally on board with the INK stuff. 
p3056
aVIn terms of inspiration/motivation: August Burns Red - Composure\u000a\u000aIn terms of just being happy:\u000aA Day To Remember - I'm made of wax, Crossfaith - Jaegerbomb, and Architects - Gravedigger (not the happiest song in the world but its such a fun song to listen to)
p3057
aVThe catchy fun stuff of Every Time I Die and The Dillinger escape plan do it for me
p3058
aVI dont know if Dillinger and good mood belong in the same sentence... I always found them to be good to vent anger to.
p3059
aVWhat about black bubblegum or setting fire to sleeping giants? Haha
p3060
aVI dunno Prancer and Understanding Decay are pretty happy songs
p3061
aVThey have plenty of relatively happy stuff then lots of rage inducing songs haha they are a great band 
p3062
aVMilk Lizard does it for me.
p3063
aVAntares - Novelists \u000a\u000aSomething about the main riff screams good times. 
p3064
aVI prefer Twenty Years in general but I do agree with you. Something about the song puts me in a good mood
p3065
aVAlso heartfelt or delusion for me. All their stuff is great though.
p3066
aVDelusion is probably the highlight off their most recent catalog, in my humble opinion. I enjoy all their tracks, but Delusion has several good transitions and is a really well structured metalcore tune that makes it stand out from the rest of their songs.  \u000a\u000aE: I can't spell
p3067
aVThat's definitely a better way to put it rather than me just thinking "wow this song is AWESOME" haha. But yeah I definitely agree! Twenty years got me hooked onto it all, but now I play delusion more than anything.
p3068
aVThe Downfall of us All by A Day to Remember.
p3069
aVSeen it live twice and it's always amazing. It's absolutely my favorite song to hear live just because it puts everyone in a fantastic mood!

aVLately, [Volumes - Vahle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eriXkm_EmnE).

aVEvery song from parkway drive. Especially Sleepwalker, Deliver Me and It's Hard To Speak Without A Tongue.
p3072
aVdeliver me is so fuckin liberating
p3073
aVAny song from Issues is enough to get me thru a rough day. \u000a\u000aBut these songs that get me hyped/happy: Palisades - True Blood, I See Stars - Murder Mitten, Stick Stickly (just cos'), and The Ghost Inside - Dark Horse. Just to name a few.
p3074
aV[deleted]
p3075
aVBloodmeat - Protest the Hero is always my go to
p3076
aVI would say all the metalcore I listen to puts me in a good mood. If it put me in a bad mood, chances are I wouldn't listen to it.
p3077
aVwell theres some stuff like suicide season thats not really a happy mood but i personally still enjoy the feeling this song gives me
p3078
aV"Second and Sebring" by Of Mice &amp; Men. Always puts me in a good mood. Such an energetic song, with a fairly positive message. Some of the best screaming I've ever heard, as well.
p3079
aVI feel the opposite. Whenever I listen to that song, I get so morose and introspective. 
p3080
aVWell, that sucks. I get hyped the fuck up.
p3081
aVThat song always makes me sad bc I know what it's like to lose a parent
p3082
aVAnything by HORSE the band really. They're probably the closest thing to "happy" metalcore.\u000a\u000a* [Even murder can be fun!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2jRYkOaP_Y)\u000a* [A song by the band HORSE the band named HORSE the song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux8dMBik_mE)\u000a* [Don't forget about Lord Gold.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAxDz_eEi5A)
p3083
aVPeriphery and Erra always put me in a great mood. Probably has something to do with the grooviness of many of their songs. Also, letlive. puts me in a good mood. 
p3084
aVEchoes is definitely a great one, also Fault Line\u000a\u000aEdit: Really all of Rescue &amp; Restore, when I'm stressed just playing that album helps a lot
p3085
aVTHIS IS THE FAITH. \u000a\u000aThis will be a jumbled list of artists and genre's but you get the idea. \u000a\u000aAugust burns red obviously, The Ghost Inside, The Devil Wears Prada, Breakdown of Sanity has a few. Betraying the Martyrs, Issues, Legend. Very typical list but they are the first I thought of for a reason. 
p3086
aVIssues - Never Lose Your Flames. Its just so upbeat! Every time I hear that chorus I can't help but smile and bob my head a little. 
p3087
aVKillswitch Engage - Self Revolution \u000a\u000aCarnifex's song In Coalesce With Filth and Faith does it too. But that's deathcore. 
p3088

aVReally any of A Day To Remember's stuff can put me in a good mood. If it's for after you have a stressful/bad day and want to feel like fuck you then (I know they're a little generic) I go [Like Moths to Flames - GNF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6M34lJBNko)

aVKing of Amarillo by Issues. It's really angry at the beginning and but the chorus is about moving on and being yourself. Just a really fun song that makes me glad where I'm at.
p3093
asVSo I hear a lot of metalcore out there that's anti-Christian, so I was wondering if there's any metalcore out there that's either Christian or where the members of the band are Christian
p3094
(lp3095
VLike 70% of the scene is Christian lol. Not even being sarcastic
p3096
aVHuh. I've been recommended the wrong metalcore. 
p3097
aVIt's cool. Sometimes you don't even notice since the lyrics aren't overtly Christian. I think For Today would be up your alley. They are the definition of christian metalcore
p3098
aVThanks man. I just hope I don't get too much shit now for this post. I honestly just started looking into metalcore today after I learned that August Burns Red wasn't metal, but metalcore. 
p3099
aVNo worries. Some people below have suggested good bands check em out. I'd also throw Memphis May Fire your way. They openly talk about their faith on tours

aVHe's the only one whose really open about it. I wouldn't consider the band a Christian band as a whole, but the new album is very heavy on the religious side. (Not surprising since Matty writes the lyrics) 
p3106
aVYeah hes always been very open about his faith in interviews and social media ,but he doesn't shove christianity into peoples faces which quite nice. Also i think he made a solo album which seemed a bit odd,but it must be him making acoustic songs about christianity so his band could go back making a less religious album   
p3107
aVIf he's doing a solo thing to vent the Christian beliefs, that's fine with me. I was honestly a little put off with the new album because off it, it's just a scene-y thing to do I guess, since it's huge right now. (Not trying to hate on any religion at all, just not my taste) \u000a\u000aThen again I just want to hear another album (somewhat) like the Hollow so I'm biased. :P 
p3108
aVA couple other members I've seen confirm it. I asked Kellen on fanbridge or ask.fm and he said he was. I believe their other guitarist said he was on Twitter one time. \u000a\u000aThe only members I haven't seen say anything about it is Cory and Jake. 
p3109
aVPhinehas are a Christian band if I remember correctly
p3110
aVI'm laughing so hard right now. A huge part of the scene is Christian.
p3111
aVThis isn't /r/corejerk sir
p3112
aVOP, what have you been listening to that's not Christian? Honestly curious
p3113
aVLike, Attila, and BMTH. \u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: Architects, After the Burial, Motionless in White, Within the Ruins. That's all I got
p3114
aVThere are plenty of others, ETID, Dillinger, PWD, MMI, Northlane, Sworn In, ADTR, My Ticket Home, Issues, The Word Alive and many others...
p3115
aVThe only ones in that list I listen to are PWD and Northlane. That may explain my ignorance
p3116
aVNot even adtr???
p3117
aVI actually don't like them. I know it's a cardinal sin around here, but I can't get in to them
p3118
aVWhat albums have you listened to?
p3119
aVThe most recent one. The guitars sounded really out of place with the drumming. I'll probably give them another go later on. I often have to give bands second and third chances, I'm super critical.
p3120
aVListen to A Shot in the Dark by them, it's much much better. If you like that you'll love the whole album.
p3121
aVTen four. I'll give it a go tomorrow at work.
p3122
aVCool, let me know
p3123
aVAlright, so I'm having difficulty getting into the cleans, but I'm not totally put off by it, so I'm going to press on. 
p3124
aVThat's understandable, they kinda grow on you.
p3125
aVYeah. I'm getting steadily better at listening to bands with prominent cleans, but I'm still a work in progress. 
p3126
aVYou will likely enjoy /r/Christcore  
p3127
aVDemon Hunter, Haste the Day, As I Lay Dying, Norma Jean, Underoath, We Came as Romans, Beartooth, August Burns Red, Fit for a King, Living Sacrifice, Becoming the Archetype, Wolves at the Gate. \u000a\u000aGo subscribe to Solid State Records on youtube, it's a christian metalcore label. \u000a\u000aedit: AILD stopped being christian with either The Powerless Rise, or Awakened. 
p3128
aVOn my Itunes Underoath are classified as "religious" hahah 
p3129
aVI don't think As I Lay Dying fits the bill anymore...
p3130
aVI'm pretty sure they were at one point. 
p3131
aVYeah everything prior to Awakened. 
p3132
aVWas it awakened? I thought it was The Powerless Rise. 
p3133
aVThe Powerless Rise was I believe.
p3134
aVI thought it might be. Some of the lyrics really come off that way.
p3135
aVYou might want to remove AILD from that list.  [Tim states he and other band members were athiest and just using the front of being a Christian band to make money](http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/tim_lambesis_world_exclusive_interview_as_i_lay_dying_singer_breaks_silence/P1).
p3136
aVI know Tim said that, but didn't some of the other band members deny it or something? I thought it was more that they were christian at one point but stopped being christian around The Powerless Rise. 
p3137
aVI hadn't read a rebuttal from the rest of the band, so that's entirely possible.  His claim is the and two other unnamed band members were not Christian, and the two that were pretty much fell away from faith by the time the band made the decision to keep up the lie that they were all Christians so they could make money off of the brand.\u000a
p3138
aVAh. I didn't follow that story too closely, so maybe you're right. 
p3139
aVTry Architects, they're real hardcore believers.
p3140
aVHaha very funny 
p3141
aVOh, Sleeper, Silent Planet, Beartooth, blessthefall, becoming the archetype, and of course everything on Solid State.
p3142
aVI didn't know that about Silent Planet.
p3143
aVReally? Most of their songs have direct links to bible verses.
p3144
aVYeah, I hadn't actually looked at any of the words yet. Just been digging the music.
p3145
aVI don't particularly care for their music, but they seem nice.
p3146
aVHas BTF even written a "Christian" song since Witness?
p3147
aVYoung bloods struck me as pretty Christian based, if you get over the swearing.\u000a\u000a
p3148
aVHow so?
p3149
aVAugust burns red, Silent Planet, Oh Sleeper, Underoath
p3150
aVFit for a King is Christian.\u000a\u000aWe Came As Romans has several members that are Christian.\u000a\u000aLots more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_metal
p3151
aVCheck out August Burns Red and Fit For a King. Two great Christian bands
p3152
aVI had no clue that they were Christian. I saw both of them in concert like two weeks ago. That's awesome. August Burns Red is one of my favorite bands
p3153
aVHow on earth could they be one of your favorite bands and you never notice that?
p3154
aVThat's a good question. I guess I'm just oblivious to what religion bands are. 
p3155
aVSee and that's the right attitude because if you really enjoy the music, that shit just doesn't *matter*.
p3156
aVyet, here we are........
p3157
aVExactly. I'm asking because my brother is Mormon but wants to get into metalcore. And I'm new to metalcore. I'd love to get more into it too, so I asked here. 
p3158
aV[Just throwing this out there](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/wiki/bandrecommendations). It's really good.
p3159
aVAye I'm Mormon too. But my favorite band is Architects...the contrast is too real
p3160
aVTo you.
p3161
aVYeah.
p3162
aVjust look up any band currently signed to or that has ever been signed to Solid State Records
p3163
aVUnderoath, Inhale Exhale, and As Cities Burn.\u000a\u000aOr head over to r/christcore
p3164
aVThe Devil Wears Prada, Memphis May Fire... even Of Mice &amp; Men has some Christian lyrics... \u000a\u000aBut Being As An Ocean is probably the most glaring of them all.
p3165
aVBAAO are Jewish... Hence the spelling of "G-d" in their songs
p3166
aVI didn't know that, thanks!\u000a\u000aI just remember listening to their songs and thinking they were awfully preachy. I really like them, but sometimes they can ramble haha\u000a\u000aEDIT: So I found this after doing a quick Google search: "In the Hebrew Jewish culture, the name of God is respected in such an extent that it never is spelled out or spoken of. In order to get around this, most Jews usually write \u201cG-d\u201d instead of \u2018God\u2019, so that God\u2019s name is never spelled out in it\u2019s entirety on something that can be destroyed or thrown away. A pretty beautiful tradition, if you ask me. Albeit all band members are christians, the guys in Being As An Ocean pursued this tradition, and have named their 52-minute-long debut album Dear G-d\u2026."\u000a\u000aFrom: http://legendsarising.com/2012/10/18/review-being-as-an-ocean-dear-g-d/\u000a\u000aSo I guess they're Christian, but follow some other belief's traditions, too.\u000a\u000aPretty interesting stuff!
p3167
aVHaha I feel that. I enjoy religious bands that have a sense of purpose through their religion, and have respect for christian bands that actually try to spread love and compassion, but preachy lyrics are almost always off-putting. That being said, I can usually get down to some quality christcore, and I enjoy BAAO as well.
p3168
aVJust some context and Judaism and Christianity. Christians are Jews with a messiah. So we take our core beliefs from Judaism and then apply the teachings of Jesus. Some people do fully follow the Jewish law but I think they did it just for show (not hating just saying) 
p3169
aVWoah... That's actually pretty cool
p3170
aVI cant believe no one has mentioned Wolves At The Gate!  Listen to their latest album, VxV. Some of the most christian/biblical lyrics I've ever heard. Fantastic vocalist and band as well. Solid album. 
p3171
aVWe Came As Romans isn't Christian, but a lot of the members are 
p3172
aVhey are you a Christian? Aren't these atheists LITERALLY oppressing us? Because we're Christians, like me? And I'm a Christian? Being a Christian (like me) is really, really hard. Can you believe some bands aren't Christians, like me?

p3195
aV... Or new to metalcore. And have been recommended the wrong music. I need new friends 
p3196
aVAnyone with even an entry-level knowledge of metalcore knows that Christian metalcore is one of the most popular trends amongst bands.
p3197
aVSee I'm not even entry-level. I just listened to whatever my friends recommended to me and it happened to be quite a few songs that were pretty bad with that stuff. Now I want to get into it a lot more. I had no clue a lot of bands were Christian. 
p3198
aVYeah... no.
p3199
aVYes. It's one of the most notably controversial things about metalcore.
p3200
aVYeah but OP doesn't have entry level knowledge. He's totally new, so there's nothing wrong with him asking.
p3201
aVI couldn't tell right off the bat. He said he was unaware that August Burns Red was a Christian band, I figured it must have been a joke because that's like...their thing.
p3202
aVyeah....yeah
p3203
asVPossible new ADTR material???
p3204
(lp3205
VI think I know this one.\u000a\u000aThey first released CC in October as a digital download and then in November they released hard copies of CC with 3 extra tracks not on the digital download
p3206
aVClick on it, then on tracklist.\u000a\u000aYou'll notice 3 extra songs on it. That's why it's its on a separate thing. Those are the 3 extra songs they released along with the CC hard copies\u000a\u000aIt took ADTR forever to release CC.\u000a\u000aThey'll tease an announcement, then announce the time for an announcement, then announce a new single along with a possible tour, then a 6 months to a year later we'll get a new album.\u000a\u000aI expect new ADTR material in the later half of 2016
p3207

asVMemphis May Fire - Prove Me Right (Song about MMF getting screwed over early on in the music industry)
p3213
(lp3214
VSong that got me into MMF.\u000aJammed this SO much during the summer of 2012\u000a\u000aGot nearly over 1000 plays in my iTunes haha
p3215
aVHell this is the song that got me into metalcore.
p3216
aVDon't worry guys. Matty is bros with God almighty now, so Trustkill will get their's in the end.
p3217
aVFrom the Wiki:\u000a\u000a&gt;Mullins wrote the song Prove Me Right against the former bands label Trustkill Records and is a critic on the younger music industry:\u000a\u000a&gt;\u2033The first single we released was called Prove Me Right. That song is about the music industry and what it does to me. And just kind of realizing that the 15 year old me that just wanted a record deal and thought that people in the music industry were just there to help support you and your dream when the reality of it is that it\u2019s the complete opposite. It\u2019s a bunch of money hungry suits that really don\u2019t care \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying that this is everybody \u2013 but some of the people that we worked with \u2013 people who don\u2019t really care about the music or the art at all. All they see is dollar signs. So that song is about everyone who ever kicked me when I was down \u2013 tried to make me feel like I couldn't accomplish what I have today. It\u2019s kind of a middle finger to everybody who ever said I couldn't do it \u2013 because I'm here doing it right now.\u2033

p3222
(lp3223
VThis whole album is fantastic.  So much energy, so much talent.
p3224
asVThe Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, or New Junk Aesthetic?
p3225
(lp3226
VI'd actually say New Junk Aesthetic
p3227
aVAll of the above 
p3228
aVI only can afford one sadly 
p3229
aVIf you don't have any other albums, of those three, I'd start with Gutter
p3230
aVI'd go with The Big Dirty. 
p3231
aVI would choose Gutter Phenomenon; it's classic ETID; you can't lose.
p3232
aVThe Big Dirty 
p3233
aVGutter Phenomenon for sure
p3234
aVThe cleans in that album are so off putting though, like in stiff.
p3235
aVI mean they're all great, but if I had to rank them:\u000a\u000aGutter Phenomenon\u000a\u000aThe Big Dirty\u000a\u000aNew Junk Aesthetic
p3236
aVThanks a million,  I've rarely listened if them and don't know their material yet 
p3237
aVI'd say go for The Big Dirty, that's my favorite ETID album.
p3238
aVOut of those three I'd reccommend New Junk as its my personal favorite.  But really you can't go wrong with any of them and I hope you enjoy whichever you pick up!
p3239
aVIf Ex Lives truly is absent, I'd reccomend NJA. Big Dirty is fucking wild though...
p3240
asVFellow guitar players! My band Take The Throne with a new guitar playthrough for our song Captive. Hope you enjoy it!
p3241
(lp3242
VThat was great, really nice sound and the vocals are fucking crazy. I love the Ibanez with the wooden finish, know the name of the guitar by any chance?
p3243
aVGlad you enjoyed it! The Ibanez is a Premium series RG721RW, and I swapped the bridge pickup out for a Dimarzio Crunchlab.
p3244
asVSo what's up with tape on the mics?
p3245
(lp3246
VIt's so the mic doesn't get disconnect from the XLR cable. When you're swinging it around the cable could pop out and there goes a mic and that could hurt
p3247
aVYea. Jake from August Burns Red used to tape the shit out of his mic because he used to swing it around over his head and stuff. I don't think he does that as much anymore, though. Probably broke too many mics or hit someone with it a few too many times haha. 
p3248
aVSeen them 3 times in the last y at and a half, he still dose. 
p3249
aVI've seen them 5 times in the last 2 years, and he definitely does
p3250
aVHmm, I must have missed that the last few times I've seen them I guess. 
p3251
aVI saw them last week. Can confirm.
p3252
aVSaw them on Friday, was swinging that mic around like a madman. Caught a few pics of it.
p3253
aVYeah, it keeps it from detaching from the cable, I used to tape mine, but then I got a locking cable, which works a lot better
p3254
aVEven if you aren't swinging it around it's kind of become an industry best practice to loop the xlr cord up and tape it to the body of the microphone just as a failsafe 
p3255
aVcuz it looks cool ofc
p3256
asVComment found on a Capture the Crown video
p3257
(lp3258
VLOL ok laughed a little too hard at that one
p3259
aVMay someone explain this joke to me? I don't get it :/
p3260
aVChuggga, chugga chugga chugga chugga, chugggg
p3261
aVWeird, in my head it's always been dug dug, dugga dugga dugga dugga, dug dug.
p3262
aVYeah I can make the noise perfectly, but spelling it is weird.
p3263
aVGuitars have frets, they are what allow you to make the different notes, a lot of guitars in metalcore will have 24 frets. The joke is that the band only uses the first fret because they do nothing but chug on their guitars. 
p3264
aVYeah I got that but the rest of the sentence doesn't make any sense to me :(
p3265
aVIt's a paraphrasing of the lyric from jay-z's 99 problems. 
p3266
aVSome of us just don't listen to Jay Z haha
p3267
aVI don't but I can assure you that lyric has been posted across to every corner of the internet. You don't have to listen to Miley Cyrus to know she came in like a wrecking ball.

p3274
aVAnyone who has seen The Ongoing Concept live will understand that their entire set is the best experience haha. Those guys are something else!
p3275
aVI'd give my left eye/testicle to see them live
p3276
aVI've seen them twice now. They aren't my favorite band, but they are my favorite band to see live. \u000a\u000aI can't wait for their new album, whenever that comes out.
p3277
aVWhen I got to talk to Jake Luhrs for a bit after a ridiculously hot but really fun show at a tiny venue in Pennsylvania last July
p3278
aVI saw Of Mice and Men at Skate and Surf 2013(?) I think it was, but it was before they released restoring force and The Flood was still halfway through its cycle.  It poured all night and they played with half of their equipment not working for half the set before the electronic stuff kicked in, but the crowd was really loud and it was an amazing experience.\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL32EQIJs-4) for those who are interested in seeing what I'm talking about.
p3279
aVDamn that breakdown was amazing! 
p3280
aVI was there, that show was sick.\u000a\u000aI remember the PA gear crapped out for ADTR's set after Macklemore on the right side so we just jumped to the left and pitted out the night.
p3281
aVThe first self help fest last year. So many good bands performed that day. When ADTR came out I had never seen such an outgoing crowd in my life. Literally thousands of people were singing the songs and jamming out; it was literally a party. Definitely going again this year
p3282
aVMy first ever mosh experience was pretty bad, I fell quite a few times.  But there was always this scrawny ass kid with no shirt that would come and help me up everytime and then he would disappear back into the pit.  Dude was literally my hero.  
p3283
aVI love how at shows you get "pit buddies", that is, people you've never seen before, and likely never will again, but for that one night you keep seeing them in the crowd and you have this weird friendship with them that night. 
p3284
aVI actually met one of my closest friends now in a Blessthefall pit
p3285
aV[deleted]
p3286
aVI'm sure there are a lot of people like that.  Was really surprising to me for whatever reason.  I thought everyone in the pit was just an angry person who wanted to fight at that point lol but now I know that it's much different than that (most of the time).  
p3287
aV[deleted]
p3288
aVYeah I was just completely unprepared for the pit and I was pretty much right in the middle of it my first time.  Was kind of pissed off about the beer all over the floor.  That's what really ruined it for me.  But that's how it goes I guess.  I'm a bigger guy.  I'm a little older now (25) especially compared to most of the kids at shows.  I'm always afraid I'm gonna hurt some 16 year old girl whether I get thrown into her or whatever.  So nowadays I usually just default to the 21+ section or the balcony or whatever.
p3289
aV[deleted]
p3290
aVI think mine definitely would be seeing Beartooth at Pittsburgh Warped last summer. They were on one of the smaller stages, but had a main-stage sized crowd that completely engulfed the sound tent for the stage, which was about 100-150 ft back from the barricade. Anyways, mid-set, we open up this huge circle pit around the tent, just hundreds of kids running in a huge circle around the sound tent for the last three songs of their set. My buddies and I had so much fun. I think the only way it could get any better would be to see them at a house show.\u000a\u000aThe other really fun live shows are I See Stars gigs. In the transitions between songs, they blast dubstep/EDM. Not that I'm a fan of that kind of music really, its just a non stop dance/jumping/mosh party from the time they go on, til the time the encore is over. 
p3291
aVI met The Devil Wears Prada and Enter Shikari at Warped last year. My two favourite bands.
p3292
aVenter shikari shows are the best. the energy they have on stage and the crowds are always jumping, pushing, and singing a long. love them
p3293
aVEvery and any time I have seen Crossfaith. They could get a pit going in a cemetery.
p3294
aVWarped Tour '09 watching Haste the Day's set. They close with When Everything Falls and Stephen Keech climbs into the crowd and me, my buddy, and 2 other people hold him up in the air in the middle of everyone while almost every single person sings along.
p3295
aVThe first time I heard the outro of In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3 live after the album came out.\u000aEvery single person in the god damn room screaming the "whoa, oh oh oh's"
p3296
aVSeeing Enter Shikari and thinking "well lets stay behind the pit and watch the entire show peacefully" then Meltdown (second song) starts and just went apeshit with everybody else.
p3297
aVI would have said moshing to Crown The Empire a few months ago, being my first time in the pit.\u000a\u000aBut on Wednesday I got to see ABR as covered by some of my favorite bands and crowdsurfed for the first time.  That absolutely takes the cake.
p3298
aV[deleted]
p3299
aVI got to talk to Beau from blessthefall at the Heart support tent for a long time at warped tour 2013. Super chill guy. Met all of ABR there too.
p3300
aVI was at a show that the black dahlia murder was playing. I got to pat the vocalists belly and crowdsurf. Also there was a wedding on the stage which was pretty fucking rad. It was a really small venue. The floor was just one giant wave of good vibes.
p3301
aVJake Luhrs from abr looked at me and made a heart gesture with his hands during a concert last year, and didn't stop looking at me until I've done the same gesture to him
p3302
aVWhen I was in 8th grade I went to a festival and was watching As I Lay Dying, just standing off to the side and headbanging/screaming the words as loud as I could. This guy comes up to my friend and I and is like "Wanna go to the pit?" I had never been in one, but for some reason I thought this was a good idea. So here is this 5' 8", 160 lb 8th grader running around trying to shove these massive college/older aged metal heads around, and it was a blast. There hasn't been a moment in my life where I was just having such pure fun. 
p3303
aVI'm a female, 5'5", and a serial mosher. I am, admittedly, rather strong and broad-shouldered for someone of my height and gender. I always mosh when I go to shows, sometimes for hours. At almost every show I've been to, I've had random strangers (both male and female) tell me how inspiring it was to see me in the pit and how much they enjoyed my energy. I don't really understand why this occurs, but it makes me very happy. It's very worth the minor injuries I have sustained over the years ( broken finger, blows to the head that took a bit to heal, etc.). I actually got to crowd surf during warped at one point when 2 250+ pound moshbros picked me up and sent me away. That was pretty fun. I also sing and scream, and have been complimented on my vocals at shows before. I don't understand why seemingly every heavy genre except metalcore has a good popular female singer/screamer (Arch Enemy, Huntress, etc.). The closest thing I can think of is Eyes Set To Kill, but neither of the female vocalists scream. Basically, all concerts are amazing for me. I'm right at home.
p3304
aVI saw eyes set to kill live, it was kind of disappointing :(
p3305
aVWe need a good female frontwoman in metalcore. Now, if only I could find instrumentalists to back me up...XD
p3306
aVSaw Hacktivist with Dead Harts and The One Hundred last year and it was such an insane night. In the pit I saw a guy go down in front of me so I went to help him up, he grabbed my arm as I got literally thrown over him and I pulled him up and he stabilized my fall, then he disappeared back into the pit, it took me a while to understand what happened. Was certain I was going to eat shit head first into the floor
p3307
aVI had a chance to see Obey the Brave, Emmure, and a couple more bands a couple years back and it was great. Alex From OTB is a great guy and was hanging out selling mercy after the show. I walked up to him and he autographed my phone case and got the rest of the band to sign it too. I bought a shirt and we talked for a couple minutes and it was one of the coolest experiences I've had with a person whom I idolize. 
p3308
aVSaw We Came As Romans and Like Moths To Flames in Bakersfield. Talked to Chris from LMTF, nicest most chill dude ever. Then talked with Josh and Eric from WCAR, both totally nice dudes, Kyle was there but walked away when my wife and I came up, seemed kinda douchey:/. Also chatted with Lou and Andy briefly before they played, super awesome guys as well. Main reason they're my favorite band.

p3386
aVThanks for checking it out! And thanks for the compliments! We really tried to have fun with this one!

It could also just be a coincidence, since it's kinda a classic 50's trope.

p3442
aVYes! Thank you! And when the This Life Is All We Have EP came out everyone was shitting on Anthony saying he sucked as a vocalist compared to the other guy. I couldn't disagree more, I think Anthony is an insanely talented vocalist and he blew the other dude out of the water on the Rareform re-issue and the This Life Is All We Have EP.
p3443
aVI just hate the vocalist on the original Rareform. I loved Forging A Future Self and fucking loved Nick, the vocalist on that album, and thought he fit the sound of the album. While I liked the re-recording of those few songs, I liked FAFS more. Ironic I know hahaha\u000a\u000aEdit: Forging A Future Self was the first ATB album I heard, so that's why I'm a little biased on that.

p3487
aVsworn in, barrier, gift giver

aVEnjoy Dangerkids, My Ticket Home, Issues and Sylar\u000a\u000aNot to fond on everything else.\u000aUnsure how bands could go about making Slipknot nu-metal rather than Linkin Park nu-metal\u000a\u000aCan't picture it

aVSheeeeeeeeeeeeeeit, been waiting for this. Amazing
p3551
aVFucking hype! Been waiting for this all month.
p3552
aVAfter a once through, I'd say it's a good album. It's missing some catchy hooks I think, like from To Catch A Flame and No Strings. The technicality is through the roof. Really spot on with that. I think it'll take a few more listens for it to really grow on me, but I like Mirage and Lost Isles a lot.
p3553
aVWaited like 2 years for new stuff and FINALLY.. So awesome!
p3554
aVAny significance in the album title? Seems familiar? Or is it just a track name?
p3555
aVFour Thirty Two kinda sounds like Blue 42 which is a Haste The Day opener for Burning Bridges? That's all it reminds me of.\u000a\u000aThe album is actually called Lost Isles, 432 is just the intro song.

asVRecording shows
p3567
(lp3568
VThe equipment it would take to record these shows in a good enough quality would be atrociously expensive or else I'm sure labels would be doing it more often. I do second you, though. I'd definitely pay $10. 
p3569
aVI like the idea but its pretty unrealistic to do it at *every show*. It wouldn't be a bad idea for bands to professionally record one specific show from each tour then just promote on their facebook/twitter and sell it on their merch sites. I would probably buy that. 
p3570
aVIt'd be happy if they just recorded one full set on one stop of a tour or something. No point in recording every single show with the exact same set.
p3571
aVKinda off topic, but I saw Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution in 2008 I think they recorded all their shows and you could buy a downloadable copy at the merch table. I know for sure they recorded my show because, well I have a copy of it. Great move, still love listening to that show.
p3572
aVYeah well to be fair, Linkin Park is on a whole other level. Still hoping they recorded their surprise Warped set last year.
p3573
aVStatic X did it awhile ago when they toured with Mudvayne. It was a USB type of thing that you could go pick up at they end of the show. It was just audio but it was still pretty cool.
p3574
asVBeartooth go back to their roots with DIY venue and house shows
p3575
(lp3576
VIt's really hard to believe they\u000a call that their "roots" when Beartooth got super popular very quickly because of Caleb Shomo. I'm sure Caleb did plenty of house shows with Attack Attack! and any bands previous, but with Beartooth they got popular with one EP because of Caleb's notoriety. 
p3577
aVI agree , but they did spend 6 mouths to a year playing small shows. The ABR tour seemed like the tipping point to blow them up, but they had been around for over a year at that point. 
p3578
aVI'm pretty iffy with Beartooth, but I want to attend a house show at least once in my life. Being in England means that they're rare to almost non-existent. 
p3579
aVno local scene?
p3580
aV&gt; England\u000a\u000aExactly the opposite mate. I can't speak for the UK, but I guess it's similar here in Germany. There are hundreds of bands, but none of them plays house shows. There are enough small bars, youth centres and indie venues for all shows you want to book. I'd love to see a house show, but it just never happens.
p3581
aVPretty much this.
p3582
aVThere are heaps don't worry just they'll be local bands. I live in NZ we have maybe 5 different acts you may have heard of (inc lorde) but there's plenty of house shows here, but they have been mostly punk/fuzz rock bands
p3583
aVI hope they go back to their "old" sound too. Their EP is so much better than their full-length, imo. 
p3584
aVAh man, I'd give anything to be able to attend one of these house-shows. Seems so intimate and crazy! 
p3585
aVYeah, I remember their starting mantra was "we don't want electronics, and this is a side band to not headline tours and what not." A little different wording, but yeah.
p3586
aVWell, it's not really their fault that they blew up. 
p3587
aVI don't really care about the whole gimmick thing or whatever everyone else is saying. All I know is that they are coming to my town, which doesn't get a lot of good bands like these, and playing in a house. I am SO going to the show!
p3588
aV&gt;Hardcore punks Beartooth\u000a\u000aJoke or not, that's where I stopped reading. Just no.\u000a\u000aAlso, I might be the only one that thinks this, but this seems so phony and gimmicky. A band with that kind of notoriety shouldn't be playing house shows. Is it a nice gesture? Yes, it is. But it also seems like a special snowflake move to try and make Beartooth out to be this hardcore DIY band...when they're stopping at three festivals in the middle of this run.
p3589
aVI don't get it, they seem like they are doing house/diy shows for the sake not due to necessity 
p3590
aVI don't see a huge problem with it. If they're going to have super cheap tickets and still put on awesome shows, it should be awesome. Fugazi was one of the biggest, most respected, and most innovative punk bands of their time and they played house shows, shows in churches, and even shows in basketball courts. They did it because of their DIY ethic and love for their fans. If Beartooth wants to do the same thing, that's awesome.

aVBut Fugazi wasn't part of such a commercialized scene.

p3681
aVfallujah is so good
p3682
aVArchitects would definitely be a good one, especially their last two albums. Also more post-hardcore, but The Overseer is another great band with a lot of atmospheric stuff
p3683
aVVolumes has plenty of atmospheric and gentle parts between their usual aggressive sound. \u000a\u000aI would also head over to /r/djent. That style of music is definitely up your alley if you like Periphery and Northlane.

aVERRA is pretty atmosphery, i saw them in the Frozen Flame tour with Northlane and I have to say they made a fan out of me.
p3685
aVSurroundings and Prepared Like A Bride, both doing a similar thing to Northlane, especially Surroundings.

aVTry Silent Planet. They're not really similar to Northlane or Periphery, but they're really atmospheric and have released their first full album a few months ago. I love it.

p3745
aVim pretty sure i saw it on the bands official twitter page last night, but its not there any more. I really hope you are right 
p3746
aVWell, since it was taken down, there are two options.\u000a1. It was a joke and the label didn't find it amusing and it got taken down. (Most often all the band members will have access to the twitter account)\u000a2. They weren't supposed to say anything and the label took it down because spoilers.\u000aI'm going to go with option 1, because my sister went to high school with them, and they always fucked with each other. Band members do shit all the time, and I'd venture to say that if it's true the label would've said something. Bide your time and wait for either Sumerian or AA to say anything before getting antsy. I'd say with how well BOO is doing, it would be a fools move to leave for AA, and that's coming from a fan of both. Last I had heard the guy from Make Me Famous was the most likely candidate for replacement of Danny.
p3747
aVI fucking hope it's the first one...
p3748

aVAlright good, I just wasn't sure and I am looking forward to their new album and seeing them live again, and I'd want Ronnie to be with them for that.
p3752
aVI saw them during the hometown show around Christmas, don't think they could've been more friendly with each other. I'm not claiming to be an insider, but from what my sister said, and from what i saw about them they seemed perfectly fine, and especially with a new album on the way i doubt ronnie would be leaving.
p3753
aVYeah I was really shocked at the announcement, with the new album and tour, it hit me blindsided. It probably is just a prank, and now I've gone and spread it...

aVI think from a technicality standpoint, the musicianship on "Sleepwalking" blows "The Hollow" out of the park. But I enjoy more of the songwriting on "The Hollow", those songs feel more like songs and not just riffs tossed together with a chorus in between them. Not saying "Sleepwalking" is bad by any stretch of the imagination, I just enjoy the direction of the songwriting on "The Hollow".

aVSay what you want, but they're still awesome live.\u000a\u000aI never like them until I saw them live a couple years ago when they supported BMTH and I was thoroughly impressed. I saw them again a couple of days ago and it was an even better show. There was no predominant focus on the 'newest album' like a lot of bands do, they were still heavy as and even mixed it up and bit and threw in some breakdowns into their slower/gentler songs for the crowd.\u000a\u000aSongs like this aren't the best, but you can't blame them for trying to expand their fanbase, and as long as they don't change their attitude to shows I don't have a problem.

VI think WCAR will head in the direction of radio rock with this new album they're making. The last thing I heard about them is that they went into the studio with David Bendeth who did Restoring Force, and has worked with other bands like Paramore and Linkin Park if I'm not mistaken
p3896
aVThey already sort of did on Tracing Back Roots, but I thought that album was a pretty good balance. I'm worried about the future for them though, because they could easily turn into another Of Mice &amp; Men
p3897
aVYou break up as a metalcore band or live long enough to see yourself become a rock band. \u000a\u000aBut in all honesty, Crown The Empire is the main one I can think of.  Heading into My Chemical Romance territory. 
p3898
aVCrown The Empire was borderline radio rock to begin with.
p3899
aVIf CTE was borderline radio rock to begin with than most popular post-hardcore bands should be considered radio rock.
p3900
aV1. Crown The Empire isn't post-hardcore\u000a\u000a2. "Popular" post-hardcore bands such as SWS and PTV *can* be played on the radio\u000a\u000a3. Post-hardcore is innately a softer genre than metalcore, so saying that post-hardcore bands are closer to radio rock is just a factually correct statement and contributes nothing.\u000a\u000a3b. Metalcore isn't supposed to be on the radio, period. If a Sleeping With Sirens song snuck on the radio, I wouldn't be surprised nor would I be offended. Hearing Of Mice &amp; Men on the radio is offensive.
p3901
aV1. No need to get into the whole "What constitutes post-hardcore/metalcore" discussion, so I'll keep it simple. They're closer to bands like WCAR/PTV/IFAF/Silverstein than they are bands like ERRA/ABR/etc.\u000a\u000a2. Anything *can* be played on the radio. When people talk about "radio rock" bands such as Breaking Benjamin, Red, 3 Days Grace, LP etc. come up. CTE's first album is nothing like that.\u000a\u000a3. Except that's not what I said. I said that if you consider CTE to be borderline "Radio rock" then you must consider any post-hardcore band to be "radio rock". Not "closer to" but actual "radio rock". \u000a\u000a3b. Lol says who? You? Bands changing their sound to be attractive to the "mainstream" is one thing. But saying metalcore "isn't supposed to be on the radio" is just silly. You may not like OM&amp;M's latest sound, but it's leaps better than the majority of what's played on the radio.
p3902
aVAre you kidding? What radio station outside of maybe one dude in some remote corner of the country plays actual metalcore? And how many people actually listen to that radio station?\u000a\u000aMetalcore is intended not to be a radio-friendly genre. It stems out of hardcore, which was the most anti-radio music genre before all the subgenres came along. No one wanted to hear songs about political resistance, circle pits or destroying religion on the radio and that's why hardcore was so great. It was something that only hardcore kids knew about.\u000a\u000aRadio rock isn't exclusively the sounds of Breaking Benjamin, Linkin Park, etc. It's anything that someone would turn to a rock radio station and be able to stomach. CTE isn't quite there yet--which is what I said--but they're not far off. They're inoffensive sounding. They have very pristine, polished cleans and their guitar riffs aren't so crunchy and off-putting that your typical radio listener would immediately shut it off.\u000a\u000aMetalcore is supposed to be a genre for the few, not the masses. I'm not trying to be a hipster or whatever and say "this is soooo underground, you probably don't even know about it" but it's *not* supposed to be a genre for corporations to mangle and spit back out so it can get radio play time.
p3903
aVRadio doesn't have some sort of static (not changing) requirement that has to be met in order to be played on it. They play what is popular.\u000a\u000aDo I think that Fit for a King is going to be played on mainstream radio anytime soon? Of course not. But Metalcore, whether you like it or not, is becoming more popular, and with bands like BMTH, WCAR, PTV, OM&amp;M, and more gaining more popularity fairly quickly, it'll expose more people to their older material. Metalcore is only going to get more popular, and I hope it does. Metalcore isn't supposed to be anything. It is what it is.
p3904
aVBut those bands are not getting popular for a metalcore sound. If OM&amp;M makes the radio, they're not making it with OG Loko or The Depths. They're making it with Broken Generation, or *maybe* Second &amp; Sebring. And I'm not saying I don't want people to get into metalcore, I'm saying that it's simply a fact that radio stations *USUALLY* do not put more run of the mill metalcore like FFAK on the radio.
p3905
aVOM&amp;M already gets frequent radio play on the hard rock stations on satellite radio for Would You Still Be There.
p3906
aVYou're right, theyre not. But for every new fan they make with their current sound, theres the potential to introduce someone to their older material, and metalcore in general. And the more bands that break into the "mainstream" the more people will be exposed to it. Which is only going to make metalcore more popular. May not be by much, but still. Their live shows will still have heavy elements.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, the radio, right now, does not play your run of the mill metalcore. Nor do I think that metalcore like that will ever really be fit for a radio (;D), but there are definitely some bands within the genre that people may be more open to one a mainstream level once theyve been introduced to the genre by other bands.\u000a\u000aFor example, I know plenty of people that would have never listened to music with screaming in it, until ADTR came along with Homesick. Suddenly, screaming wasn't so bad in some ways, and sure enough, some of those people got into heavier bands once they realized that screaming wasn't as bad as they thought. That same thing could very well happen with bands like BMTH or OM&amp;M. People become fans of their new material, decide to look at older stuff, decide that they like it, and bam.\u000a\u000aMy whole point is that no, I'm not generally a fan of bands changing their sound strictly to break into the "mainstream", but I would rather listen to OM&amp;M's new stuff than have to listen to 90% of whats on the radio right now.
p3907
aVAre we really classifying any bands with a couple of clean songs as "radio rock"?
p3908
aVYes.
p3909
aVSo Between the Buried and Me is radio rock?
p3910
aVYou have entirely missed the point.
p3911
aVMemphis May Fire \u000a\u000aEdit: maybe Northlane 
p3912
aVNorthlane seems just to be going in a softer prog direction, rather than radio rock, at least judging by Rot
p3913
aVRot wasn't really that progressive of a song though 
p3914
aVTrue, but also in interviews, they've been saying the new album is going to have softer moments, but still be heavy and progressive, plus at least IMO, Rot was still a great song, and very different from the watered down radio stuff Of Mice &amp; Men and bands like that are doing
p3915
aVIt's still very watered down compared to their other stuff. Even compared to softer prog bands like Tesseract, it's still very bland. 
p3916
aVI liked it, I guess that's just me though
p3917
aVI'm not saying I didn't like it, or that it's bad, but I can see them going that route with Marcus. It'll probably be the one band that I wouldn't mind doing it either. \u000a\u000aEdit: words\u000a\u000aEdit 2: damn people are sensitive af about Northlane. Get over it.

aVIf Beartooth does another album with ripping verses and boring poppy clean choruses that ruin the rest of the song (which they did on nearly every song), I will lose my shit.
p3932
aVSadly I agree about Beartooth, I'm really disappointed with the direction they're going in after how much I liked the first EP. I also think Crown the Empire is probably going down that road, and apparently Machines is already being played on the radio sometimes
p3933
aVAttila?
p3934
aVIssues unfortunately 
p3935
aVTrue :(
p3936
aVevery song ive heard from issues sounds like an R&amp;B pop song. arent they WAYYY past hard rock?
p3937
aVThey aren't the heaviest band in the genre by any means but they still have some heavy stuff. Check out Stingray Affliction, Sad Ghost, and King Of Amarillo.
p3938
aVThe Amity Affliction. Their last album had singles that went Top 40 in their country and the songs have a lot of pop influences (The Weigh Down's intro could easily be an Owl City song).
p3939
aVAmity has big big in Australia for a long time, not just with Let the Ocean Take Me
p3940
aVDon't forget what All That Remains did, they didn't have the "fangirl fanbase" style that a lot of these bands do and after a few great albums they sorta killed any interest I had with the most recent album.

asVNot sure where to post this but thought this was the best sub. I bought this painting a couple years ago at a charity shop and later noticed it was signed Bannon. I have always wondered if this was an early Jacob Bannon painting. Imgur album link in text.
p3944
(lp3945
VNo clue, but that's pretty rad if those are some of his paintings.
p3946
aVIt wasn't his. I updated the post. I had emailed him and he got back to me to let me know. Now I know at least, and I still like the painting, but I thought that was very cool that he replied back :)
p3947
aVI've been thinking about it and I think it is him, but to get confirmation you could try to contact Bannon or email deathwish inc
p3948
aVThanks for your suggestion. \u000a\u000aI just sent an email. Had considered it before but I don't want to be weird or anything. I guess the worst that could happen is no response back. 
p3949
aVNo problem, please update me if it is him as that painting is sick and Converge are one of my favourite bands.
p3950
aVI updated the post but he already replied back. It is not his work.
p3951
aVOh sorry to hear, ignore my message. At least it is still a cool painting.
p3952
aVWho dat
p3953
aVthe bassist of Blood On the Dance Floor
p3954
aVHe's pretty good at it too aye 
p3955
aVPlease be joking...
p3956
aVNope
p3957
aVNever heard of a small band called Converge?
p3958
aVHahaha OHHHHHHHHHHHHH

aVHe's the vocalist, at least now you know.

aVSorry for self promoting a bit but we had this discussion here:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/2truqz/theory_on_aas_new_lead_singer_wouldnt_be_that/\u000a\u000aBut on topic i'd love it to happy, and a lot of hints point to it being the case :D
p3965
aVDamn, I was away from this sub for a month or so, sorry for re/shitposting. :/
p3966
aVHaha not a problem! Tbh I still want to talk about it so if people flood here that is awesome! As I said last thread i'd be cool with Jeff Wellfare being the lead too.
p3967
aVthe first day they were in the studio denis was in russia(I think it was russia) with crown the empire so Im still a little skeptical but he would work pretty well with them imo.
p3968
aVWith Down and Dirty about to release a new video in the coming weeks, I can't truly imagine it being Dennis. It makes a lot of sense and I wish it was him but I'm pretty sure Asking is going to surprise us with this new singer

p3974
aVNo ADTR?
p3975
aVI've never actually listened to ADTR other than Common Courtesy, but I was under the impression that they're more pop punk than metalcore.

p3978
aVNah, they're under Various Times/ Currently Popular/ Misc. 
p3979
aVSorry didn't see that heading, which of the three are they of those?
p3980
aVCurrently Popular. 
p3981
aVThey are gaining momentum but they are far from popular , judging off facebook likes and youtube views.\u000a\u000aLike I'd say they are a popular reddit band like heaps of people on reddit know them that listen to that music.
p3982
aV&gt;They are gaining momentum but they are far from popular , judging off facebook likes and youtube views.\u000a\u000aAnthony Fantano has done a review for their new album, so they are gaining some traction I guess.\u000a\u000a&gt;Like I'd say they are a popular reddit band like heaps of people on reddit know them that listen to that music.\u000a\u000aThat's what I meant more or less. They're popular with people who listen to the music. Which is what's important, in my opinion. 
p3983
aVAnthony does small band reviews like Calaviire who tiny, he reviewed code orange's debut as well.\u000a\u000aThey have been popular on /r/hardcore and some people in /r/metalcore dig it. Its hard to explain though, like a band like Turnstile is bigger than them in the hardcore scene (who were upcoming) just they haven't got anywhere near the size of stuff like trapped under Ice
p3984
aVI've seen them get a bit of love here on this sub though. I mentioned Silent Planet for the same reason. 
p3985
aVI have mentioned them a lot here tbh haha only in comments though. I was going to compare them to silent planet but I think Code Orange maybe more popular, what do you think?
p3986
aVI think Silent Planet is a bit more popular here, honestly. 
p3987
aVI meant outside of reddit
p3988
aVOh. I don't know about that then, I don't personally know anyone who likes metalcore. 
p3989

p3994
aVYeah, by the end I just started listing somewhat prominent European bands because their aren't as many as I first thought. 
p3995
aVYou probably don't know of the french band [Novelists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1shNps9uyvM) then.

aVBeartooth is not essential.
p4000
aVseriously, no ABR. wow.
p4001
aVI gonna reiterate.\u000a\u000a&gt; Also, If I leave any out... I don't care.
p4002
aVThe Bled, Poison the Well, Misery Signals, For the Fallen Dreams, Greeley Estates, Haste the Day, I Killed the Prom Queen,  It Dies Today, Norma Jean, Underoath
p4003
aVI'm not sure how I should feel about only ever listening to 3 of those bands. 
p4004
aVI think they are pretty essential bands in the growth of the metalcore scene.  Check em out!
p4005

p4013
aVConverge, Poison the Well, Dillinger Escape plan, Every Time I Die, Botch, Underoath.\u000a\u000aShould be every ones starter kit to metalcore.
p4014
aVThat was to some extent my starter kit and I haven't moved much from it, since being a fan.
p4015
aVProbably [August Burns Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFrfCSAIuwQ)
p4016
aVThe space-tripping psychedelic bands:\u000a\u000a* Erra\u000a* Northlane\u000a* Born of Osiris
p4017
aVBring Me The Horizon\u000a\u000aAsking Alexandria(first two albums)\u000a\u000aAfter The Burial\u000a\u000aNorthlane\u000a\u000a\u000aPS, all the ones said thus far are also amazing \u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: can someone tell me why I'm getting downvoted? \u000a\u000aEdit 2: now I look like an idiot bc it's back at 1 lol
p4018
aVThe absolute ESSENTIAL metalcore bands are the ones who released their biggest albums between 2002 and 2007:\u000a\u000a* Killswitch Engage\u000a* As I Lay Dying\u000a* Bullet For My Valentine\u000a* Trivium\u000a* Atreyu\u000a* Underoath\u000a* All That Remains\u000a* Shadows Fall\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of other, newer bands in the genre that are great (PWD, ADTR, TDWP, ABR, whoa acronyms) but if you really want a good sense of WHY the genre became popular and what bands were responsible for making it so, listen to these bands.  
p4019
aVIt is ridiculous what AOJB did for metalcore music. 
p4020
aVExactly! I'm not even sure kids today are even aware of that album. I was in high school during the mid 2000s and got experience all the bands I listed in their heyday. There is a defined line in heavy metal, before AOJB and afterward.
p4021
aVAs was I. I feel very privileged to have been part of that scene, as a young listener, and to witness it grow first hand. I use to crank Fixation on the Darkness when me and my buddies would play the first call of duty on our high school computers. Fuck, I feel old. 
p4022
asVFeed Her To The Sharks - Heart Of Stone (2015)
p4023

VI think this and Walking on Glass are my faves from this album.
p4025
aVTerrorist is pretty sick but I honestly loved the whole album.
p4026
aVYeah the whole album's great, my fave from them so far. 
p4027
asVFit For A King - Destruction.
p4028
(lp4029
VFun fact: this song is  about  westboro  baptist
p4030
aVThanks for the fact! That's interesting!
p4031
aVSuch a great song
p4032
aVOne of my all time favorites.
p4033
aVIt's just so heavy right from the beginning, and doesn't stop
p4034
aVThis song gets me fucking going. Definitely a go to jam to get me amped up for absolutely no reason
p4035
asVThis Or the Apocalypse - Lamnidae (I've recently come to the conclusion that Haunt What's Left is one of the best metalcore albums out there.)
p4036
(lp4037
VSuch a good band\u000aStill waiting on them to release something new :(
p4038
aVThe singer on Facebook just said that they're without drummer and waiting to find a new one
p4039
aVI should get on those covers! 
p4040
aVI just scoured their facebooks  and I saw nothing of the sort. When did he say it?
p4041
aVOn his personal page! Someone posted on his wall asking, I'll try and nab a screenshot later
p4042
aVLink??
p4043
aVI love this band so much.
p4044
asVWhat would you guys consider a newer "classic" in the "AP" / warped scene?
p4045
(lp4046
VI guess With Roots Above And Branches Below isn't recent enough? I'll say Northlane's Singularity for metalcore and Acceptance Speech by Dance Gavin Dance for post-hardcore.
p4047
aVTDWP was the AP band of the year in 2010 so I guess it counts? 
p4048
aV[deleted]
p4049
aVThe Emptiness by Alesana. The Thespian was the first song I ever heard that had screaming elements, and from there I was forever hooked on heavier genres. Alesana was one of the first popular -core bands to introduce interesting conceptual albums (along with Periphery, of course) in the "new wave" of -core. I feel as though The Emptiness in particular was very impactful. I can't find a single mediocre song on the album, and it serves to tell an intriguing tale based on the workings of Edgar Allen Poe. 
p4050
aVI agree, although it's not really a scene-changer or like super influential. Very good, but not a whole lot of people cite it or alesana as much of an influence I don't think.
p4051
aVI think it will get more influential as time goes on. The band has really been into their local music scene and I wouldn't be surprised if a band gets huge. 
p4052
aVThat's interesting, considering how many fans they have. I personally cite Alesana as one of my influences (out of literally hundreds of bands that I listen to), but I think you're correct in stating that not a whole lot of people do. 
p4053
aVnot a huge fan of the first 2 but sempeternal, stand up and scream, and with roots above and branches below
p4054
aVProbably Son I Loved You At Your Darkest by As Cities Burn, Juturna by Circa Survive, and Mirrors by Misery Signals. If we're talking last 10 years those have got to be it. Everyone else is posting shit that came out like, yesterday.
p4055
aVSon I Loved You At Your Darkest by As Cities Burn is such a phenomenal album that I feel is way underappreciated. Grat too see some love for ACB here. 
p4056
aV"Son I Loved You at Your Darkest" is quite possibly one of the greatest post-hardcore albums ever composed. Whenever it comes on, I can't even skip a song. 
p4057
aVSempiternal?
p4058
aVI could definitely agree with Sempiternal. 
p4059
aVyeah not a fan but definitly
p4060
aVHonestly, I cannot think of a single album that rivals Chasing Safety. That album was so widely appreciated across the different, albeit, similar, genres of the scene.
p4061
aVProbably Constellations by August Burns Red. Not my favorite of theirs, but probably their most "defining" album
p4062
aVIs it really renowned as a classic to most people in the scene? I'm regrettably just getting into ABR. 
p4063
aVI'd say so, though with the love/hate relationship this sub seems to have with ABR, I'm not sure how many people here would agree with me. Regardless, they're definitely a popular band in the genre, and Constellations is really the album that defined their sound
p4064
aVI'd say Messengers over Constellations 
p4065
aVPossibly, I just personally feel like Constellations has more potential
p4066
aVBy going by the "classic" thing, I feel like Messengers fits better idk :/
p4067
aVI feel like Messangers is more of a classic now, where Constellations has more potential to be a classic in the future
p4068
aVWhat about Rescue &amp; Restore? I'm pretty sure that album has the least amount of haters for any ABR record.
p4069
aVI think that the next Architects release will be on that level. You can all hold me to that.
p4070
aVI could see that, but they have to be more ground breaking and different for that to happen, in my opinion. To clarify for everyone else, I meant albums that have already been released, but thanks for your response nonetheless haha :)
p4071
aVYeah, I couldn't think of a recent metalcore album that could be given that kind of praise, so I cheated a bit. I think Architects have steadily developed and grown as a band over their last few albums, so if their next is an improvement on LF//LT, then it's going to be massive. \u000a\u000aAlso, excellent calls on Homesick and TDAGARIM. Two of my favorite albums.
p4072
aVThink the last 10 years, like Suicide Season.
p4073
aVDefinitely disagree \u000a\u000aEdit: but I find them over-hyped. Great band, but over-hyped. 
p4074
aVI would've said Common Courtesy as the metalcore/pop punk classic/standard. I thought it was surprisingly solid. And Semipiternal is very good for illustrating the current trend of evolving into nu-metal influenced, while still maintaining individuality and quality. Northlane's Singularity I think will be considered pretty classic for the sort of prog metalcore crowd.\u000aAnd OM&amp;M's The Flood is, to me, a classic for Risecore type bands. And don't think im bashing it, I love it. 
p4075
aVHomesick, Roots Above, and MAYBE Sempiternal will be hailed as classics, if anything from this generation will be. Though it's much too soon to tell.
p4076
aVSempiternal \u000a\u000aThe flood \u000a\u000aHomesick \u000a
p4077
aVThis, but I'd also add *Stand Up And Scream* since it helped popularize the genre.
p4078
aVIt's hard to say since there's a lot more variation nowadays.  But as far as my vote goes I'd probably have to give it to Issues self-titled.  Really innovative and catchy stuff.  Stoked for their new album.
p4079

p4085
aVBloodWork - Texas In July (2014). \u000a\u000aThe got a new Vocalist in JT Cavey and the band is unstoppable. It may be my all time favorite album. Every single song is a banger \u000a\u000aNote-Alot of people like to compare TIJ to ABR. PERSONALLY I see no resemblance and think TIJ is better (Not hating on ABR I like them alot, music is opinion). \u000a\u000aGive it a listen, even if it's just the first song I think you'll be able to tell they aren't generic or boring. The whole album is fantastic. 
p4086
aVJust checked out TIJ, I can totally get down to that 
p4087
aVFuck yeah my man! 
p4088
aVBroken Soul pretty much dropped the floor out from under me. 
p4089
aVIt was such a good starting song. I wasn't a big fan of old TIJ (something about Alex always annoyed me), but once BS started I could instantly tell this album was going to be a banger. Pseudo Self is my personal favorite song off the album. The chorus is just perfect
p4090
aVIt was more their older stuff that was a lot like ABR
p4091
aVPeriphery - Juggernaut Alpha + Omega

aVAh I know periphery! Pretty rad stuff

aVI think you might like the new August Burns Red album Rescue &amp; Restore, especially if you're into proggy stuff
p4094
aVABR is prog?
p4095
aVThey have some proggy stuff on their newer albums
p4096
aVI guess creative capacity counts, I know that their songs are pretty technical, but they aren't exactly a progressive band. Progressive music is defined by experimental music that usually focuses on jazz chords, the jazz scale, and atonal notes, which ABR has none of. Their songs are just really fast riffs on the phrygian and mixolydian scales.
p4097
aVThey have some of that stuff in the interludes in songs like Treatment and Count it All as Lost
p4098
aVReading Comprehension: F.

asVA Day To Remember - Your Way With Words Is Through Silence
p4100
(lp4101
VDoes anyone else do that thing where you start listening to a band, find their older music, and then like it better than all the new stuff?
p4102
aVI agree, But with ADTR I have found all of their releases to be great. Their older albums are non-replaceable but I really enjoyed CC.
p4103
aVYeah, happens a lot. Mostly because when a band starts becoming popular, their label pressures them to conform to what's popular in the scene instead of innovating and doing their own thing. Thus shittifying their sound. Some bands avoid it, others come out of it, but a fair few just become worse and worse until they break up.
p4104
aVI always chocked it up to emotion. When you first start something, your passion is always the highest. Which would show in your music. Your explaination makes more sense.

p4129
aVHave you listened to the lyrics at all? Yeah he is religious

aVDefinitely. I've been there a few times before, but that was years. Ever since I moved to richmond a little over a year ago there hasn't been any reason for me to go to it haha.\u000a\u000aI think there may have been 1-2 shows over the past year but I wasn't able to make them.\u000a\u000aRichmond used to be a set stop for almost every tour on the east coast, now most tours hit NC, VA beach, and then either springfield or somewhere in maryland

ABR, Blessthefall, The Word Alive, Chunk or MIW, and Oceans Ate Alaska.\u000a\u000aEdit: Ice Nine Kills could also be in there somewhere, as Outerloop is basically Fearless

aVABR was actually here with Blessthefall, Northlane, and Defeater last winter at the National but I missed it because of... you guessed it, finals.\u000a\u000aAnd I would watch the hell out of that Fearless Friends tour.

p4194
aVAww I totally should've gotten that

aVNice! I didn't have a chance to see them with this tour (Frozen Flame Tour) let alone get a VIP meet opportunity. I did have however seen the twice in a neighboring town when they toured in 2012 and most recently with Asking Alexandria in 2014. I only got to see Jake this last one and I had bought their Leveler vinyl at the show so I got that signed. Next I have all their albums on vinyl now (Except for Constrllations of course :/ ) next chance I get I will definitely pick up a VIP ticket to get them signed.

(lp4214
Vstand behind wherever the pit is.\u000a\u000afront = you are going to have people crowdsurfing/kicking you in the face and stage-diving on your face in addition to people pushing you in the back constantly.\u000a\u000abeing near the pit in general = you are going to get karate kicked in the mouth by mouthbreathing hardcore "dancers".\u000a\u000aso behind the pit or to the side of the pit (but not too close) is probably best for your situation.
p4215
aVYeah, /u/ManWithoutModem hit the nail on the head. You have far less of a chance of getting crowdkilled if you're behind wherever the pit is, because those kids generally don't move further from the stage. Best of luck to you.
p4216
aVWow man that fucking sucks i've been going to gigs for almost 10 years and (touch wood) have never taken a head injury. Hope all is well. I've never seen STYG or TAA but I shouldn't think the crowd would be any crazier than a PWD crowd. I agree with /u/ManWithoutModem, avoid the pit, it may be a good idea to go near the side of the crowd by the front of the barriers and keep an eye out, most crowdsurfers go to the middle and where I see bands they have bouncers up front who can get you seen to medically if you go over the barrier. We don't have stage divers too often here.

aVNever been hit the head or just haven't had an injury? Probably half the shows I go to, I get hit someway or another in the head.

aVI've been in pits in venues ranging from arenas (Metallica) to bars (Zao) and I've never come out without at least bruising.  Nearly had my glasses destroyed at a The Chairot show, and since then, I've stood in the back.  Being tall it's not as big a deal for me, but if you're shorter it might impact your experience.  If your friend can do some blocking for you, you might be able to stay a little closer at STYG, but I'd recommend hanging back a bit.  Or you could wear a hockey helmet and try to start a new trend.

I went to the show tonight and didn't end up with a concussion!! :) I found 3 cuts and 5 bruises, but nothing major...these are just normal "battle wounds" from having a great time at a concert. \u000a\u000aFor those of you who haven't bought your tickets to the Disobedient Tour, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it. It was by far one of the best shows I've ever been to! The TAA crowd was pretty rough &amp; the STYG crowd was so full of energy. In Hearts Wake rocked the show as well, but not many people seem to know them so the crowd was lame at best. Being As An Ocean was pretty good but I'm personally a huge fan of them so I was just chilling with my friend at the bar while they were performing so I can't tell you much. I saw this dude getting punched in the nose during STYG's performance but other than that, people were wild and fun but also very respectful to the people around them :-)

aVFor clarification, Phil is the vocalist of All That Remains and also from what I can tell is known for making some pretty outspoken political statements.  You can look into it more if you want.  I was too lazy to read through the article that came out about him recently.\u000a
p4259
aVHe also got into an argument on MSNBC lol.
p4260
aV&gt; Phil is the vocalist of All That Remains \u000a\u000aWhich one?
p4261
aVThe only lead vocalist they've ever had?
p4262
aVI mean does he do the harsh vocals, or the clean ones? 
p4263
aVHe does both.
p4264
aVAh. 
p4265
aVeasily one of my favorite vocalists, especially on This Darkened Heart, The Fall of Ideals, and For We Are Many
p4266
aVBeast 
p4267
aVPhil Labonte is an absolutely amazing vocalist.  He would have had the job for the new KsE singer if Howard Jones didn't show up!  Read it in a Revolver magazine when the Fall of Ideals came out.\u000a\u000aHoping their new album on the 24th of this month is heavy!
p4268
aVWho?
p4269
aVGreat vocalist.  Don't agree with some of his politically based stances, but that doesn't affect my respect for him as a vocalist. 
p4270
aVIt's well established that I think he's a complete and utter asshole and therefore I refuse to support his music.\u000a\u000aWhich I'm sure will start the same debate I've been having for the past 2 weeks all over again. (ie the "just because he's a bad person doesn't mean you can't like his music!" thing)
p4271
aVHonestly, I don't know what anyones talking about in this thread since I don't pay attention to them much outside of their music.  But I do think it's weird some people say they won't listen to a band because one of the members is a jerk or something, when I see people posting on As I Lay Dying songs with stuff like ''i dont care if he wanted to murder his wife, the music is still awesome''
p4272
aVPhil basically said that gays aren't allowed to feel persecuted because they're not going through what black people went through in the 1950s.\u000a\u000aAnd just in my personal opinion, I cannot support musicians that say stuff like that. If I buy their music, their t-shirt, or go to one of their shows, I'm funding them. I'm giving them a bigger platform. People like that don't deserve a platform. Kids look up to people like Phil Labonte and people agree with what he said solely because he's Phil Labonte. That's wrong.
p4273
aVWow, I didn't think he would've said something that foolish, I get why people wouldn't want to support their stuff, kinda why I don't pay attention to bands outside of their music and read interviews etc, don't want the music ruined for me

aVI can't get into this album much, and I don't know why. I love their latest record, along with the single that's coming out today. I do however, really like this song. Just not the rest of the record as much. It may be in the production, and that Spencer's voice is just so much better these days than it was, I just can't pinpoint my reasoning.\u000a\u000aBut this track, man, this track...not as popular as it should be. A metalcore classic.

aVIts not that I don't like it, its just much more "average" to me than The Greatest Story or any track of the Predator Becomes the Prey. Just can't get into the album as a whole like I can with the new one.

aVS'all good, man. Different strokes for different folks and all that stuff. I prefer The Predator Becomes the Prey as well, I just think some of the vocal harmonies in Safe Is Just a Shadow are mind-blowing.

Vwelcome to the world of metalcore shows in 2015 where to kids go after their karate practice to show off their moves
p4477
aVIt started long before 2015....I was going to Metalcore shows in 2003. People crowd kicking, slam dunking, fighting invisible ninjas, running back and forth punching people on the edges of the pit. I saw people intentionally punch holes in the venue walls, break the moulding off of columns and smash tables and chairs. Way back when. So this is nothing new. \u000a\u000aEver been to FSU show ten years ago? Hit one of their members in the pit and get assaulted by 5 guys. Walls of Jericho walked off on the second song because someone jumped on stage and punched the singer (a small female) square in the face. Ever see people take their shoes off and use them to slap people in the crowd? Ever see people pour bottles of water all over the floor so no one could mosh because they didn't like the band? Ever seen people standing against the back wall and people are still running back and forth and punching them in the face? 
p4478
aVThis is the problem with Code Orange, awesome band but bloody hell their fans are crowd killers like checkout their [This Is Hardcore Set](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv2pZptU3H0). Of the TIHC videos I've seen, their's seemed the most violent by far

aVWhats invisible ninjas?
p4488
aVI understand the kind of fight moshing at beatdown shows and stuff but for more generic stuff it does piss me off. I personally don't see much problems with hardcore dancers as long as they are respecting the people outside of the 'pit'. Hell even I do it sometimes but even then, someone falls over you pick them up.
p4489
aVit really depends on the genre imo. I'll all for more circle pits and old school pits but if I'm seeing something like black tounge I'm throwing the fuck down, I'm sure someone will call me a karate kid of whatever but I really don't care
p4490
aVNormally shows in my area are pretty good, but I went to beartooth a few weeks ago and a fight broke out in the pit. The music stopped, the lights came on, and one of them was escorted out. It's nice to see that although the metal scene is changing most bands still won't stand for people being dick.
p4491
aVAs long as they don't bother people on the outside of the pit, I don't care. I fucking hate crowd killers though. There's crowd killers at like every show in my area.
p4492
aVI don't get how hardcore dancers got the reputation of being dicks. I am a hardcore dancer, and I have never met another one that won't make sure someone is okay if they get hit. The culture is developing and that's just how it is.

p4508
aVLol I'm in the same area code and I can't go for the same reason
p4509
aVIts a damn shame guys in hearts wake was awesome. They have this band '68 they dont belong at this show.
p4510
aV Maybe, IHW is supposed to come back to sac when they tour with the ghost inside  and acacia strain sometime in march
p4511
aVMy roommate is going without me because I have work. However, I have seen STYG quite a few times and they are ALWAYS fantastic. Their setlists don't disappoint, the mic is passed to damn near everyone, and from my experience the crowd is never really douchey or bro'y. Everyone is just there for a good time. If it is your first show just be conscious of what's going on around you. The pits will get going and although no one really wants to intentionally hurt anyone, it is a possibility. 
p4512
aVAwesome i just want to enjoy the show. Im with a friend whos been to these kinds of events\u000a
p4513
aVIsn't Being as an Ocean on that tour too?
p4514
aVYes i believe so
p4515
aVThey're great, definitely check them out if you haven't listened to them before
p4516
aVMaybe its because i dont know any of their songs but i really didnt care for their performance all that much. 
p4517
aVAh, fair enough, also maybe they're just not your thing
p4518
aV I do give it to the lead singer he walked along the crowd as he sang. I did listen to the hardest part and it wasnt bad. 
p4519
aVYeah, that's one of my favorites from them

aVthanks so much\u000a\u000a
p4531
aVSo IHW played a total of 5 songs with 2 off of divination?
p4532
aV Yup they were the opening band. Followed by '68 which killed the mood of the place. IHW definitely should have gone before TAA and needed to play more songs. 
p4533
aVAlso if you wouldn't mind me asking for TAA's setlist?
p4534
aVI recently started listening to them so not too sure what songs were played but they opened with pittsburg, the weigh down and i think they closed with dont lean on me but they played more songs
p4535
aVThank you so much man. I am glad you had a good time \u005cm/,
p4536
aVNo problem sorry i didnt catch the rest of the songs
p4537
aVIt's all good man. One more thing, did Joel Birch Happen to come out for guest vocals on Earthwalker?
p4538
aVSadly no. I thought they would since they were touring together but it just wouldn't seem right if they did. They were the first band to play and TAA was second to last. So to me it would have been weird to have him come out and then go back inside for another 2 hours.

p4547
aVI normally disagree with everything you say but so far you're right.
p4548
aVNah, last year was a lot worse, at least IMO
p4549
aVDude last year was a banger. The Ghost Inside, Volumes, Beartooth, Anberlin, Parkway Drive, The Story So Far, Four Year Strong, Every Time I Die, Neck Deep, State Champs, Yellowcard, Stray From The Path, Issues, Vanna, This Wild Life, A Lot Like Birds, To The Wind, Fit For A King, Real Friends, Elder Brother, the list was ridiculous. I didn't even get to see like 3/4 of that list. \u000a\u000a2013 and 2014 were the two years I had to make tough compromises to see the bands I REALLY wanted to. This year for me, it's just '68, Being As An Ocean, Hundredth, Have Mercy, and Slaves and I wont even be sad if I can't see the last two. FFAK, This Wild Life, and Neck Deep are repeats, but I've already seen them. And Emarosa isn't even coming to my date, but they would totally be on my must-see list.
p4550
aVThe only bands I really liked last year were Beartooth, Born of Osiris, Every Time I Die, and The Story So Far, I already like that many bands on this year's tour, and I feel like at least a few more bands I like are going to get announced. 2013 was definitely a great year though
p4551
aVI feel like it's according to taste, I usually go Warped for Pop punk bans I usually can't catch and in that way it's pretty good this year. But metalcore has really only 4 bands representing this year. Also I still remember 2008 and 2009 having bands like 3oh3 as the headliner so it's  not the worst but yeah pretty lacking.
p4552
aV68 is decent, I wish The Chariot was still together and playing instead though
p4553
aV68 and Emarosa are cool, but still not enough quality bands that would make me want to go
p4554
aVYeah, this.
p4555
aVTrue. And Emarosa aren't even coming to my date. I'm sad. Right now for me its just BAAO, Hundredth, and '68. \u000a\u000aI hope they still have some bangers in their pocket. 
p4556
aV68 is sweet, but i don't think it's enough to go. Other than that, if I didn't live just an hour away from their hometown, I'd go for PUP alone. Although they're not metalcore, I suggest to anyone who's going to check them out.\u000a\u000a[PUP - Guilt Trip](http://youtu.be/4gnntMvMgx4)\u000a\u000a[PUP - Reservoir](http://youtu.be/D6UaplvdnWM)
p4557
aVI can only hope one day Warped will have a lineup half as good as 2011.\u000a\u000aAttack Attack!, Asking Alexandria, August Burns Red, A Day to Remember, and The Devil Wears Prada all as main stage?? God that was amazing. 
p4558
aVPlus WCAR, Winds of Plague, A Skylit Drive, The Word Alive, The Acacia Strain, Of Mice and Men, Miss May I, and Enter Shikari
p4559
aVDuring the meet and greet at the frozen flame tour.  ABR said they will be playing the tour this year.
p4560
aVThat might just be enough for me to go. 
p4561
aVI already had a feeling they were playing, but knowing that makes me a lot more excited about it now
p4562
aVI believe 2011 had whitechapel and suicide silence as well
p4563
aVThat was 2010
p4564
aVPUP are sick mate, check them out. Not metalcore but still. 
p4565
aVToo many people are giving up faith!\u000a\u000aMaybe Warped is announcing all of the smaller bands early (with a few big names here and there ie: BvB, BTF, Neck Deep to keep people interested) so that more people know them when summer hits. They'll be dropping some big names towards the end of winter I'd assume.\u000a\u000aI mean think about it, there's only a handful of main stage acts to have been announced thus far. Don't lose hope friends. 
p4566
aVThat's sort of my theory as well, Levi from Miss May I pretty much revealed that they're playing, plus I have a pretty strong feeling that ABR is also playing this year
p4567
aVYes Modsun!
p4568
aVI mean, I'm really enjoying this year's lineup. At least 15 bands so far I've liked, and they're announcing until April, so I'm even more excited.\u000a\u000aTo each their own, though, I guess. 
p4569
aVBlessthefall, Crossfaith, and Our Last Night was enough to seal the deal for me
p4570
aVAnd FFAK.
p4571
aVYes, forgot about them
p4572
aVI really am hating these announcments they're just jerking us around by making us think oh this wednesday will be good and then all these shit bands get accounced with BVB or Amity Afffliction being thrown in there so it seems like it was a good announcment. I mean I love warped tour I go every year to catch pop punk and metalcore bands with friends all day. But I feel like they should just announce like 2 big bands in seperate short videos and then put all the small time edm and scene shit in their own small videos.

(lp4581
VI like Aaron Gillespie of Underoath most. He just has this drive in his voice where when he sings really loud it sounds like he's almost screaming, and it really adds to the oomph of the vocals.

p4586
aVLots of people like Jesse. His vocals and guitar playing are top notch. 
p4587
aVYeah I know but a lot of my friends can't get into his voice which I don't understand. His solos are some of my favorite of the genre, I can listen to the Hybrid Earth solo for days on end.

aVNice mix there, Periphery's new albums are killer.
p4593
aVSpencer is amazing with From First to Last too. 
p4594
aVOh. If we're commenting with non-metalcore ones too, then it's hands down Stu Block. [Timeless Winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nQ4ZR-NI6A) and [Suspension of Disbelief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqPZuGVOBzE) are amazing. 
p4595
aVI'd say probably Marcus Bridge at the moment, and his cleans are also great live
p4596
aVRot is phenomenal, how's his stage presence? I'm going to the frozen flame tour in Houston and can't wait to see Northlane.
p4597
aVIt could use a bit of work, but for someone who just joined a band, and has never toured much before, it's really good, and his vocals sound great, even on the songs from Singularity, not to mention that Rot sounds amazing live
p4598
aVYeah I figured it was gonna take some time, I was interested to see how he handled the older tracks so good to know he's handling it well.
p4599
aVHe definitely is, also really excited to see them live when they have a full album with his vocals
p4600
aV[deleted]
p4601
aVThat's weird, must have just been an off night for him, when I saw them he sounded great on both the cleans and screams
p4602

aVFair enough, when was this? I saw them at the Boston show of the Frozen Flame tour, and he sounded fine then
p4604

p4624
aVTAA's choruses are some of the catchiest I've ever heard. 
p4625
aVCaleb shomo from beartooth. His vocals are just raw and not girly 
p4626
aVHis stage presence is awesome too, the Beartooth headliner in Houston was one of the most insane shows I've been to.

asVQuestion for the sub
p4661
(lp4662
VFor me, it seems like I've gotten more and more involved with it, though I've gotten way more picky about which bands I'm interested in
p4663
aVI've never been able to go to shows bc I don't have a car or a reliable means of transportation, but I have noticed myself getting less interested in metalcore as I get older. Not to say I'm uninterested, but I've been focused more on post-hardcore, skramz, indie and the like.
p4664
aVIt doesn't hurt to change it up. Keep things fresh. I find myself listening to a lot of softer/relax music... almost anything except metalcore, because when I go for runs or drive somewhere that's all I'm blasting. Then I go for periods where metalcore is *all* I listen to until I change it up again.
p4665
aVi think metalcore is mostly for teens/scene kids now, i don't listen to it as much as i used to. im more focused on hip hop/post hardcore.
p4666
aVFeel the same way dude. Like im beyond sick of the cliche "bands saved my life" bullshit. \u000aDrakes new mixtape saved my fucking life
p4667
aVi haven't given it much of a listen but i played a song or two and it was meh
p4668
aV10 bands and star67 are probably my favorite (of the new tracks)\u000aI would say 6 god and Used To but they were released before the mixtape so i wont include them\u000a\u000aHe's still dropping Views from the 6 next month too
p4669
aVKnow Yourself tho\u000a\u000aI WAS RUNNING THROUGH THE SIX WITH MY WOES
p4670
aVYeah, I've definitely faded away from it. I mean, there are still bands in the genre I love, but I don't listen to as much as I used to. The majority of metalcore sounds the same to me, so I got bored with it. Lately I've been listening to a lot of grindcore and death metal, as well as rap, as well as some EDM. 
p4671
aVFeel the same way, i started branching out into just every genre as opposed to being dead set on one genre.\u000a
p4672
aVFor sure, otherwise it gets old fast.
p4673
aVnah I don't really go to too many big shows though, the local scene here is dope
p4674
aVI guess...  sometimes I just don't feel like going to a show.  That's why I missed frozen flame.
p4675
aVThere was a point where I didnt listen to this kind of music for around 3 months. I moved onto more death metal but found myself attracted to the clean vocals in metalcore. 
p4676
aVDepends a lot on the metalcore you like, I grew old of so much metalcore really quick but there is a few gems here that I just listen to non stop and I think that should be the case with most genres that you have a varied taste.
p4677
aVI'd say I have. About 50% or so. My favorite bands are releasing mediocre albums or "selling out" as some people might say. Now (for the most part), I'm listening to music 5 years ago, or dare I say it, brings something new to the table.  \u000a  \u000aBut I kinda feel like it's a cycle. Maybe. We have shit [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eePvRdj5w_Y) which is the same shit I listened to in high school (10 years ago).  \u000a  \u000aI also used to go to every heavy show in town for 12 years. I just thought and haven't been to a show in over 6 months. I also used to buy albums constantly, but now I maybe find one interesting album a month now. Moreso smaller bands on bandcamp.    \u000a  \u000aI used to be the one that would say that there are subtle differences that gave bands their own sounds and identities. But now, with the 1000s of bands in the scene, I hate to say and feel that a lot of bands literally sound the same.
p4678
aVI've never really been "part of the scene" as I'm not the type to leave the house much. But I have been listening to less metalcore lately, in favor of melodic death metal and death metal. \u000a\u000a

aVThat's exactly why I love them now, his singing really goes great with Ian (and Garrisons) low style of screaming, just took me awhile to start enjoying it

aVVery well deserved! I got to talk to Adam after their set opening for Ghost Inside and a Every Time I Die. Very nice guy.
p4757
aVGreatest show i've ever been to. That was the show that got me into Architects. Fuck they are incredible live. \u000a\u000aBacktrack and Hundredth were really good, too. 
p4758
aVGotta agree on them being one of the best live bands, saw them at Reading Festival last year and the energy those guys generate on stage and amongst the crowd is insane. Jason from letlive. coming on stage as well solidified that as one of the top 3 live performances I have ever seen. 
p4759
aVThat Reading gig was fucking incredible, man. One of the best gigs I've ever been to, such an amazing atmosphere in that tent. SO pumped to see them at roundhouse next month.
p4760
aVThat tour in general looks amazing, Every Time I Die and Blessthefall on support too, couldn't really ask for more. Was gutted when I realised I couldn't make any of the dates near to me, enjoy it anyway! 
p4761
aVThe Reading performance was the greatest show I have ever seen out of the 100+ I've been too. I am unbelievably hyped for Roundhouse.
p4762
aVYeah, that show deserved the headline slot for The Pit. Not taking anything away from OM&amp;M but the Architects set was just on another level. That was an overall awesome day in The Pit now I think about it.

GOD. \u000a\u000aI have been listening to INK since they would hold signs up at Warped Tour that said "Come to X Stage, and listen to Ice Nine Kills!" and it just blows me away to see how far they've come. \u000a\u000aThey write amazing lyrics, have amazing vocals, and have PHENOMENAL instrumentals. \u000a\u000aOh, and the breakdown in this song? One of the most amazing breakdowns I've ever heard. Jesus fuck this song kicks like a Sensei.

aV"Even Van Gogh would call it a bloody good impression" has to be one of the smartest and most clever lyrics I've ever heard in metal.

asVJay James of BFMV leaves band. [Discussion]
p4807
(lp4808
VMan this is really heart breaking coming from a huge Bullet fan. Jay's vocals were fucking sick live and always added that extra something to the shows. Kinda bummed I never really met him. But hope the best for him and his family. The new album is going to be killer though and I can't fucking wait. Also to see them live with Slipknot!
p4809
aVI have seen both of them live in the past 2 years and they both have killer shows! I hope I find a way to one of those concerts
p4810
aVReally hope to see if they can bring someone on that can scream as well, Jay's screams always kind of was the icing on the cake for me. \u000a\u000aLike in Waking the demon, without his screams I don't think I would love that song as much as I do. 
p4811
aVDamn, I always thought Bullet was one of those bands where no member would ever leave without the band breaking up.\u000a\u000aHeres hoping they can find someone who can scream well. Maybe they'll find someone who brings an even heavier element to the band. That would be nice
p4812
aVI'm kind of indifferent. They haven't put out anything worthwhile in 7 years. 
p4813
aVThe new album should be fucking epic. They've put 10 months of pre-recording on it. Been excited for the album since Raising Hell.
p4814
aVIf it's like Raising Hell it might be good sure. But that's one single, that's not really "something". Just a fraction of something. 
p4815
aV10 months of prerecording bro. They had 20 or so songs , they've kept only 10 out of them. 
p4816
aVDoesn't mean they're ten good ones. 
p4817
aVIt could.
p4818
aVHopefully. 
p4819
aVThey do that with every album tho
p4820
aVNope . Temper Temper was hardly prerecorded.Matt even said that this was the longest that they had spent on pre-rec.
p4821
aVRaising Hell was pretty good, that came out late-2013.
p4822
aVOkay, one single. That's it though. 
p4823
aVIf it's any indicator of the sound for the new album, that shit's gonna rip.
p4824
aVAww man, that sucks. They haven't had a member change since before The Poison. I mean, most of the songs are already written, but it could still affect their sound.
p4825
aVSaw BFMV back in 2010 and I noticed how good his screaming was.
p4826
aVThey're going to have to find a bassist who can also scream.\u000a\u000a Big loss imo, wonder what the reasoning was?
p4827
aVI think maybe the reason was since he's a single father. Maybe the touring was a bit too much time to be away from them.\u000aI'm pretty sure Padge has done some live screams before, maybe with a little practice he might fill in for that role.
p4828
aV&gt; I think maybe the reason was since he's a single father. Maybe the touring was a bit too much time to be away from them.\u000a\u000aPretty sure that's it. Additionally to "different opinions of the direction the band is taking". Can't find the source, though.\u000a\u000aI'm happy that they parted as friends, it seems.

p4853
aVThat's not their first album, it's just the first one on Spotify and iTunes. [Falacy](http://youtu.be/mgcCImkm8zg) is their first. 
p4854
aVI stand corrected. thanks for the info.
p4855
aVLyrically the same, yes. But the sound changed, I can't throw on soundtrack to a party and jam with friends like I can the newer stuff. "Ten years later and were still a fuckin band, if you've ever been a hater I'm your number 1 fan" is the best example. I stop whatever I'm doing at the time just to jam and recite that lyric with my friends religiously. The older music just doesn't have that. I love both sounds though. So that's rad.
p4856
aVI'm having trouble understanding what you mean
p4857

aVOh, man. Where do I start. For starters, check out the link /u/moshlyfe generously provided. What are three of your favourite metalcore bands?  
p4913
aVUhh Top 3 Metalcore bands for me right now are probably Annisokay, Oceans Ate Alaska, and Monuments\u000a\u000aEdit: That new INK single was fucking sick\u000a
p4914
aVCheck out More Than a Thousand's  two most recent albums. 
p4915
aVINK is amazing, and i hate when other people say stuff like this, but I've been listening to Oceans Ate Alaska for years, since Clocks. Stoked for their new album! I was about to recommend Erra, but I saw your comment. Stuff like Glass Cloud, Volumes, and I second MTAT's newer stuff. 
p4916
aVJust based on your flair, I'd say Erra would be a good band to listen to if you haven't checked them out yet
p4917
aVI tried Erra out. Maybe I didn't listen to it enough but I couldn't get into it. What would be a good starting point?\u000a

aVI personally find the side bar link to be outdated, many of those bands are inactive now, or their music is no longer available, or hard to find. Obviously a lot still is a very good place to start, but its not the one-in-all solution it used to be. \u000a\u000a\u000aI don't have any suggestions for bands, but I will list how I find more music.\u000a\u000a\u000a* 1   I start with a band I like on youtube, and look through the suggested videos on the sidebar\u000a\u000a* 2   I use spotify and look at similar artists and try one of the top few songs listed.\u000a\u000a* 3   If some of the bands you like have a semi-well known label, check out their website. Its not a guarantee, but its better than nothing.\u000a\u000a* 4   Pandora. Create a station with you absolute favorite artists and then be really really strict with the thumbs up and down button.\u000a\u000a* 5   Bandcamp.com is pretty good for finding fledgling bands, especially djent at the moment. I have found a lot of stuff I've liked on there, and much of it is free if you are strapped for cash. \u000a\u000a* 6   I thought of another one, Facebook/Twitter. (My experience is with facebook because I don't use Twitter, but I imagine there is a similar feature) "Like" Monuments page, and what ever else you like, and you should start seeing suggestions for other pages to like in the sidebar. There's currently some drama happening over the way Facebook handles their pages, so you may want to stick to Twitter for this one.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHappy Hunting!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEdited for formatting

asVNorma Jean-Memphis Will Be Laid To Waste The first song to get me into metalcore back in 2004...
p4923
(lp4924
VThat takes me back! I remember the first time I saw them at The Scene in San Diego and was just after this album came out and Aaron Weiss came out for his part at the end wearing this crazy fur coat. It was TOTALLY INSANE that he was there for it. 
p4925
aVI didn't get to see Aaron Weiss for his part, but I got to see Josh come out for it when The Chariot opened up for Norma Jean a few years back.  That was pretty fucking amazing!\u000a\u000aedit: [This wasn't the show I saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HewC3akt6Bg) but this guy was much closer to the band than I was.  Love this video!
p4926
aVYeah I'm double lucky because I happened to be in Cleveland a few years back when Norma Jean and the Chariot toured together and that night Norma Jean played Bless the Martyr from beginning to end and Josh came out and sang an entire song. It was rad knowing I would never see that again in my life for sure.
p4927
aVThat's soo cool, I used to live in SD. Where did you watch them, Soma? I saw underoath, devil wears prada, and saosin there. Best concert of my life.

p4934
aVWhat are other good songs (from any other metalcore band) with good lyrics ?
p4935
aVWell I guess it really is a matter of opinion but I've always been found of Underoath's lyrics. If I had to pick a favourite though it would have to be a tie between Converge, the Chariot and Fear Before (specifically the Always Open Mouth).\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLRYREmJqho\u000a\u000ahttp://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/converge/janedoe.html#1\u000a\u000aIf you haven't heard this yet, read a long and listen. This album is such a good example, even though the words in the songs are next to unintelligible

p4940
aVI really hope you know he (Aaron Weiss)is in Mewithoutyou. Listen to the first album(A to B Life) because that's the album that lines up with this song. If you like that part just get ready.

p4952
aVTheir last album that was decent was Come Clarity. A Sense of Purpose was below average, as was Sounds of a Playground Fading. Siren Charms is an abomination.
p4953
aVThey haven't made anything good since clayman.
p4954
aVIsn't the frontman from All That Remains the guy that said that gays aren't allowed to feel persecuted because they're not black people from the 1950s?
p4955
aVThat's him! \u000a\u000aBoth ATR and In Flames have been churning out shit for the last 9 years, this show isn't worth going to..
p4956
aVWith all due respect, In Flames is still a very good live band worth seeing. They usually play a lot of old gems as well but seeing as this tour will be in support of their latest album it will probably have more new songs. 
p4957
aVI don't doubt they're great in a live setting, but as you said I'd rather not see them play almost exclusively newer material. I'm still kicking myself to this day that I missed their tour back in '09 with Killswitch, BtBam and Protest :(
p4958
aVHe said they're not allowed to feel as offended about a word (presumably "faggot") as black people.
p4959
aVIn other words, he's fucking stupid. Case closed.
p4960
aVAnd what does that have to do with his music?\u000a\u000aNow I'm not here to debate about politics and other pointless shit on a music subreddit, but before you make a retarded judgement about a person, [I suggest reading his latest comment on these things](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/phil_labonte_just_because_im_not_gay_or_black_doesnt_mean_i_should_be_excluded_from_making_social_commentary.html)\u000a\u000aEdit: I should additionally say that I don't agree that this excuses his previous sayings about the LGBT community. That was a pretty rash comment.
p4961
aVSo this guy's response to everyone getting pissed off at him is "well that's just my opinion"? And you're going to suggest that *my* judgement is retarded?\u000a\u000aIt has everything to do with music. If a dude in a band is a bag of dicks, it means that buying that band's music, merch, tickets, etc. directly supports that aforementioned bag of dicks. It's all intertwined. If a person is a piece of shit, they can be the greatest musician on the planet and they don't deserve support IMO.
p4962
aVJesus christ, you act like this guy is funding a fucking Neo-Nazi organization to make sure all gays don't get offended by the word "faggot". I'm willing to bet some (if not a lot) of your music that you listen to was written, played, or produced by someone just as bad, if not worse, and you just don't know it. Do we honestly need to know the full political background of every member of a band in order to enjoy their music? Music is fucking music and it shouldn't be anything more than that, when you start to involve people's personal live's and opinions then it is no different than ridiculous celebrity gossip.
p4963
aVSo let me ask you a question slugger: do you think Front Porch Step should still be touring? Do you think people should still be buying his music?
p4964
aVOnce again, you act like Phil is directly doing something to harm a group of people. You are comparing a man stating his opinions to literal sexual harassment. In the case of Front Porch Step, it's more than just opinions, it is real disgusting actions that he is taking. So no, I don't think people should support him, and I think you can realistically realize that there is a *very* big difference between Labonte and McElfresh. But if one enjoys the music either of them make, there is no shame in that, **it's  just music.**\u000a
p4965
aVOkay, then let me throw a different one at you...how do you feel about Varg Vikernes of Burzum? He's an avowed neo-nazi. Aside from the actions he's taken that have gotten him in trouble, do you think people should support him even though he's a neo-nazi?\u000a\u000aIMO, terrible people do not deserve support. It's impossible for me to listen to someone's music and not think "oh yeah, this guy is a total fucking idiot"
p4966
aVOnce again, that's a radically different situation, that guy is a fucking neo-nazi. My point is that if we based all the music we listen to on the opinions of the members of the group then there'd be a lot less music for us to enjoy. Phil Labonte hasn't harassed anyone or hurt anyone, he has simply stated his opinions, and suddenly that has an affect on how you enjoy the music? Neo-Nazis and sexual assault is a whole other issue that I agree, I wouldn't want to support the music either. But for an opinion that quite frankly a large amount of America believes? You're not funding a fucking terrorist here.  \u000aAnd please don't give me any more examples. There are countless black metal and rap bands that are even worse than the things up and said, from church burning and gang violence.
p4967
aVWouldn't surprise me, I know he's said a lot of pretty ridiculous things
p4968
aVInteresting how Periphery recently dropped Vik Guitars after the owner made disparaging comments about Cynic for having gay members in it. I wonder if they know about this comment and if it'll come up on tour!
p4969
aVExcept the guy isn't homophobic by a long shot. He's a hardcore libertarian and atheist who just thinks the LGBT community shouldn't be as offended by a word as the black community.
p4970
aVHe's made some pretty stupid comments lately. I don't believe he has any right saying who should be offended by what. It's not his struggle.
p4971

aVAll that remains got me into metalcore, and in flames were one of my favorite melodic death metal bands, but everything those 2 bands put out recently just sounds like listening to your favorite child dying a slow, painful death. Periphery is kickass doe
p4979
aVDoes anyone know if In Flames plays any of their good ol' days music on their tours? Or do they mainly stick to their new stuff? 
p4980
aVThe oldest they go now is Clayman, maybe one song from Colony if they feel like it.
p4981
aVI saw them like 4 years ago (Trivium opened) and they played a pretty decent mix of new and old, they have so many albums they can't play every good song, but I mostly went to see Trivium, IF was just a bonus.
p4982
aVYou can check out their setlists here: http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/in-flames-43d6837f.html\u000a\u000aIt's mostly new stuff with a couple classics thrown in the mix here and there
p4983
aVYou guys say it doesn't matter what political stance the members take, its about the music. But that's bull. If the lead singer is a bigot I will never listen to them. Even if they're the best thing since sliced bread. They don't deserve my support.
p4984
aVI thought that read as All American Rejects and Periphery and just about shit myself with WTFness. 
p4985
aVMove Along is a better album than the most recent ATR and In Flames albums.

aVWell, I just saw Periphery last week but damn this would have been a dream concert for me if they came to Oregon. Still probably seeing In Flames and All That Remains when they come around with Wovenwar though.

p5003
aVI hadn't actually heard of any of them disagreeing to a reunion.  Give it enough time and they might have the passion for it again.

VTo a quality stickler like myself, it seems like you have the intro in really good quality (256-320), but then the Shadow Moses track sounds like you ripped it off the music video from youtube (128-192 quality). \u000a\u000aOr, maybe its just the way YouTube recompressed the mp3 after exporting from audacity. \u000a\u000aI really like how you did this though, very well done. I've done a few of these myself, like adding the Big Wiggly Style intro to Danger: Wildman by TDWP as they play it live, and fusing the "triology" of Periphery songs together from their second album. I love stuff like that. 
p5060
aVI noticed that about the quality. Although it does bug me, I'm not complaining, OP. This is a fantastic edit and I think if it was edited with identical qualities, it would be flawless. Cheers!
p5061
aVHey, can you provide a link to that big Wiggley danger fusion? I LOVED it live. 
p5062
aVThat bugged me too. But it's actually not even the studio version of the song right? Seems to have longer intro vocals from Ollie and then "This is sempiternal" before the heavy part kicks in. And on the album it's just "we're going nowhere." \u000a\u000aI'd love to get a version of this with the HQ intro and full quality album version of the song. \u000a 
p5063
aVYou're right, that copy of Shadow Moses is an alternate version I ripped from Youtube a while ago, where the opening chant is twice as long and the last line of Oli's intro is replaced with the "this is sempiternal! scream. I was originally going to edit it with the album track, but the vanilla intro just didn't have enough buildup and oomph.
p5064
aVIf anyone's curious, the vocal intro is\u000a\u000aRika Muranaka - The Best Is Yet To Come
p5065

aVthis is great! i really enjoy metalcore songs with slow intros and outros... do you do anymore of this? or know where i can find more edits like this one??
p5078
aVSorry, I can't think of any more to do. I did this one because I went to BMTH's Taipei concert with my friend and couldn't find the studio track of the concert performance version anywhere, so I stitched the intro and song together.

p5099
aVI've listened to Underoath only a little bit over the last several years. Very talented from what I could tell. I understand that Aaron was the longest serving member. Can anyone explain why he left? It seems like he was essentially the heart of the band.
p5100
aVHe felt called to do other things. http://badchristian.com/podcasts/ this is the link to the podcast he is interviewed on. It is a long one and if you enjoy the band Emery the beginning is interesting but if not you can skip like 20 minutes in and it should start soon after.
p5101
aVUpvote for Badchristian
p5102
aVDefinitely my favorite podcast.
p5103
aVI think he just did everything in Underoath that he set out to do. Not 100% though.
p5104
aVI can't figure out why he left, I only know he did so to go on a missions trip to africa and then release a praise and worship album or two. Maybe he just got sick of being the only active Christian in the band? maybe he got tired of touring with that kind of music? Who knows. \u000a\u000aOne thing to realize is that Aaron joined the band when he was still in high school. He's grown up, he's gotten married, people change, especially when they're young. Maybe he realized he didn't like Underoath and much as he did when he was still playing drums for what was effectively his youth group's band?

VI still can't believe this is the band that released The Fall Of Ideals. What the fuck happened to them... 
p5109
aVbands can't stay the same forever. TFOI came out almost 10 years ago, bands change, bands progress. The new record has some good jams on it
p5110
aVThey don't have to change so drastically though. Skeletonwitch have sounded mostly the same since Beyond the Permafrost and they're just fine. \u000a\u000aAILD changed from album to album, but they all still sounded like AILD aside from Beneath the Encasing of Ashes. 
p5111
aVOnly listened to the first track so far, but the vocals  when he says "always" sounds EXACTLY like the line "The scene is begging for a grave tonight\u000aIt always, it always will" in Demon Hunter's song [Sixteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTdyoRwp0jw). \u000a\u000aBefore you say anything about my ratings here, look at [my rating system](http://i.imgur.com/bVX6wuN.png). \u000a\u000aedit:\u000a\u000aThis Won't End Well: Sounds like a buttrock version of melodic metalcore, and I'm sort of okay with that. 3.5/ 5\u000a\u000aNo Knock: As boring as new Attila. It actually sounds like they're trying to be Attila.  2/ 5\u000a\u000aDivide: Ungodly levels of buttrock here, this could be the [theme to a sonic game] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPBmDptqlQ). 3.5/ 5\u000a\u000aThe Greatest Generation: Don't care for this one, just mediocre chugcore. I can hear glimpses of what they used to be though, and  the chorus is great. They need to stick with the buttrock segments. 2.5/ 5\u000a\u000aFor You: Forgettable acoustic ballad. 2/ 5\u000a\u000aA Reason for Me to Fight: Pretty good melodic metalcore song, with a forgettable breakdown. 3.5/ 5\u000a\u000aVictory Lap: Pretty groovy buttrock with a touch of metalcore, Having not listened to anything from these guys other than The Fall of Ideals, it's good to hear that he can still growl. 3.5/ 5\u000a\u000aPernicious: More forgettable chugcore, but the guitar solo is nice. Reminds me of old Asking Alexandria. 2/ 5\u000a\u000aBite My Tongue: Killer drum intro into a catchy clean section? I'm on board from the get go. And an At the Gates Riff right after? Fuck yeah. Chill ass bass interlude in the middle? And a guitar solo. 4.5/ 5\u000a\u000aFlat Empire: Forgettable ballad with pointless chugging 1.5/ 5\u000a\u000aTru-kvlt Metal: One of the worst song titles I've heard since TDWP's early days, and I like it. I like those song titles. The song itself is great. It's finally the All That Remains that I love. And the first good breakdown of the album. Though too much focus is on the breakdowns, which holds it back a bit. It reminds me of Indictment, but with a little less charm. 4/ 5\u000a\u000aCriticism and Self Realization: A 7 minute metalcore song? That's fucking risky. And it doesn't work. The softer moments are good enough, but the metalcore segments are bland. This would be boring as a 4 minute song, but it's excruciating as a 7 minute one. 1.5/ 5\u000a\u000aFInal verdict:  It's not awful, which is better than I was expecting. But there's no reason for it to be almost 50 minutes long. \u000a\u000aRating: 3/ 5\u000a
p5112
aVRelistening to the album whilst reading your thoughts on each song, and i agree with most of your assesment.\u000a\u000aIn regards to the Tru-kvlt metal title, they intentionally made it sound stupid because they were tired of people comparing their latest efforts to TFOI.\u000a
p5113
aVI do like the fact that the title is stupid. 
p5114
aVpernicious is my fav song off the album
p5115
aVhonestly this is a really good rock/metal album. I've always loved this band. There is a couple stand out songs in this album, and Phil sounds pretty good on this one. 
p5116
aVit does have a lot of radio friendly songs but songs like "This probably won't end well", "Pernicious", and "Tru-Kvlt-Metal" are really good. 
p5117
aVATR, for me, are a very hit-or-miss band. I usually cannot listen to their albums (outside TFOI) from start to finish. \u000a\u000aNot a fan of Phil's sing/talk vocal style he has been using during the verses of ATR songs. He never had a *great* clean voice, and the fact that more and more of their songs rely on his cleans is a turn-off for me.\u000a\u000aTheir earlier work was carried mostly by Phil's aggressive screams and some sweet riffs by Oli and Mike on guitar. I feel like this album lacks both. The guitar was pretty 'meh' in comparison with their previous efforts.\u000a\u000aI do, however, really enjoy the fact that they're finally using Jeanne's vocals now. Adds a nice element that isn't common in the genre, but certainly welcome.\u000a\u000aOverall an OK album imo. 2.5/5

p5242
aVDon't get caught by security and don't do it around giant straightedge kids in crews who start fights.
p5243
aVbeing straight edge for 4 years, having multiple edge tattoos, ive never once punched someone for smoking pot and ive been around crews who have seen people dealing drugs at shows and they did nothing. Really not fair to generalize people
p5244
aVSettle down, I'm not blaming straightedge. I was Edge for 5 years and I was the same as you, just a non-participant in substance abuse. A lot of crews are unaffiliated with sXe, and are just made up of douche bags, but the most common grouping  of people who will start fights at shows over drugs are edge. I've seen this first hand in many cities on tour. It sucks seeing a good cause get misrepresented.
p5245
aVI don't think I've ever seen a straight edge crew at a show, or anywhere really. And the few edge kids I do know would lose any fight they started. Is that seriously a problem in some places?

p5252
aVMost shows I go to are in Amsterdam, so yes.
p5253
aVYeah. I think it's kind of a dick thing to do though, unless it's outside and you're away from the crowd.
p5254
aVdamn, lotta anti-drug folks on /r/metalcore, i guess it figures
p5255
aVDon't be stupid. There's anti-drug and then there's people who don't want to deal with your drug use. I couldn't care less about what you do at home, just keep it there.
p5256
aVChill bro. I don't smoke, I'm just not a self-righteous dick about it :) One day, you too might be a well adjusted adult who is able to cope with the world!
p5257
aVHow is thinking that people who want to smoke should do so off to the side self-righteous? Its just common courtesy. But I'm not about to get into a dick measuring contest with a 15 year old over this so if you wanna 420 blaze it in the pit then have at it.
p5258
aVNah it's fine. Its to be expected at a concert. That's like saying you don't like the smell of sweat or beer at a concert. Sure it might be unpleasant, but it's an unavoidable part of it. I say just be chill about it, let people do what they want.
p5259
aVYeah, I'm not cool with it. Not because I'm not cool with weed, do whatever you want in your own time and space, but not in a public sphere. I just think it should be courtesy for people not to. Outdoors its more understandable, because the air is open and the wind can carry it off, but even then I'd rather not have this 16 year old lighting up right in front of me as I'm trying to watch someone. 
p5260
aVYeah sorry. I'd rather not inhale smoke from people reeking of weed. It's annoying, and I'd rather not get a 3rd hand high. And it's not the same as sweat or beer. Are you kidding? Excuse me while I sweat in a close quarter room, with a bunch of people who are all there do do the same thing while my body *naturally* releases liquid to cool itself. If you smoke, smoke outside before you come in, don't smoke in the crowd. I'm sure you can live without your precious plant for a few hours. You have no reason to smoke in the crowd except to somehow try and look cool in front of a bunch of 16 year olds.

aVa "3rd hand high" dude thats not how pot works lol

aVYeah, I know that's not how it works. You missed the point I was making.
p5263
aVthe smells annoying? I personally never bring any inside, if someones passing some around I'll take a hit though 
p5264
aVFor me, yeah. A kid in one of my college courses who sits next to me comes in with a cloud of weed smoke around him every single day. Just got done smelling him about an hour ago. In fact, when I typed my first message, he was right next to me, which is probably why the message seems pretty snappy.
p5265
aVno worries dude...I like the smell because I smoke it, before I smoked it I thought it was gross. I never go "out" reeking of pot its like living the stereotype lol
p5266
aVYeah that's cool man. Thanks for fighting the stereotype haha
p5267
aVlmao
p5268
aVWell beside the whole safety thing and those laws, right...? Awful logic.\u000a\u000aEdit: I'm not bashing pot, I'm bashing the idea that lighting any type of flame in a roofed off building is a good idea. Thanks for the downvotes
p5269
aVI don't think there's anything unsafe to me about other people smoking pot. They're usually pretty discreet about it anyway. And then I don't really give a shit about the legality of it or whatever.
p5270
aVApart from fire?
p5271
aVYes, I'm sure a joint is likely to cause a massive blaze.
p5272
aVWith the right weed there will definitely be someone massively blazed.
p5273
aVNo offense but I'm not sure you understand how smoking works. There's not like an open flame. It's not a torch, it's a cigarette, pretty much, if we're talking about joints. And more people are gonna be holding up lighters in appreciation of a song, than people blazing up.
p5274
aVA quick search on google gives plenty of examples of fires caused by cigarettes, especially if youre putting it in a bin.
p5275
aVThere will always be smoking at a concert, regardless of the type of music and where it's at. Some venues don't seem to care much, others are really strict about it. I was at Best Buy theater in NYC a while back and they had a few security guards in the pit that were picking people out of the crowd and tossing them out for smoking. It basically comes down to insurance and liability purposes at that venue. To specifically answer your question: people typically smoke during the stage set-up or they'll do it back away from the pit since there's way too much going on to be able to actually light up. My advice: just do it outside in your car before the show, that way you don't have much to worry about, you won't have to worry about your pipe/joint/etc. getting ruined. 
p5276
aVThe only times I've smoked at a show have been at Warped Tour where we're always outside where the smell and smoke can dissipate easier and it doesn't bother others too much. Most of the time I smoked before the show with the bands 
p5277
aVAt my stop of the Frozen Flame in MN there were definitely a few people smoking pot, lots of vaping(not sure about spelling?) and drinking for sure though. 
p5278
aVI was there. I swear the room reeked like pot as soon as Miss May I came on stage... I thought it was them who brought the smell haha
p5279
aVYou can at some I guess by reading these comments but I got kicked out for doing that. It's expected but I guess not allowed.
p5280
aVYea, I do.  Typically it's alright, usually just get hungry stares to pass it.  Only at a few warped tours did any kids give me trouble for it and they quickly got swallowed by the crowd.  \u000a\u000aIt's definitely not as prevalent at metalcore concerts as it is others, but it still happens.
p5281
aVpeople smoke pot everywhere. Hell at Holly Springs reunion the band was smoking joints on stage, and luckily some good samaritan passes me one :D  
p5282
aVI've done it on the floor of an Asking Alexandria show. personally, I wouldn't recommend it because it brings you to a mellow state of mind but you've got all this commotion going on around you. they're both great, just not together
p5283
aVWarped tour last year is really the only show where I've done it, since most of the time it's so chaotic that it doesn't really work well. At Warped tour though, all of the bands I liked had already played, so I just smoked with my friends and watched Attila, I think that was the only time I slightly enjoyed them
p5284
aVDefinitely, joints were being passed around at a Killswitch concert in Grand Rapids.
p5285
aV[deleted]
p5286
aVYep. Me and a group of friends did it at an ADTR concert in September. The security really doesn't give a shit.

VTheir new vocalist is HUGE. He's also great live
p5297
aVMy buddies had never heard of these guys before we went to the Frozen Flame tour but I had been listening to them for a while. When we got there, they were getting ready to come on stage and one of my friends points him out and was like "damn, that stage hand is massive". \u000a\u000aHe didn't believe me when I said that was their new vocalist until he came on stage. He's built like a damn NFL line backer, its ridiculous. Especially matched with Jesse Cash and the rest of the band whose all pretty small lol. 
p5298
aVThe dude is a tank! I saw them last night in Portland. They're by far my favorite band.
p5299
aVI thought it was funny when that one dude got on stage and jumped on his back and started head banging.
p5300
aVThat guy did that for almost every band that played.  He was up there all night.  Haha. 
p5301
aVHes also a super nice guy, hung out around their merch table the entire time talking to anyone who came by.
p5302
aVI talked to him and Jesse a bit after the show, and it definitely seemed like it
p5303
aVI talked to Sean and Alex too when they played in my city, they're the most sociable band I've seen come around, love the guys!\u000a\u000aI've noticed on Instagram that if you take a picture with them almost all of them like the photo as well! You don't see that often!
p5304
aVProbably my favorite Erra song, also great live. Interesting video too
p5305
aVWhy did you link to the timecode at 45 seconds?
p5306
aVMost likely when he paused it and posted it to here.
p5307
aVThat's exactly it. Sorry about that! Wasn't intentional. 
p5308
aVMaybe it's just me but I feel like the new erra is missing something. it might have to do with Garrison and Alan's departure, but I just can't get into the new stuff the same way I did with Impulse and Augment. Not to take away from this though they still make great music.
p5309
aVAgreed. Moments of Clarity does feel like it's missing something (although I do enjoy it), but I think that's because it was kinda rushed. I'm hoping their next release will be more on par with Impulse and Augment.
p5310
aVI believe Alan had a major influence to their djenty guitar chords and riffs. I kinda miss the old sound in their new stuff. \u000a\u000aGive this [guitar promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lz0ZiJjykQ) a listen.. it's really great\u000a\u000aJesse then started using more guitar solos (Hybrid Earth) and added more cleans to the song. Maybe that's why Alan left since Jesse was standing out more than him. I still enjoy their new stuff but not to the extent of Andromeda or Impulse. 
p5311
aVYea man after watching the video I can see the difference. It's too bad, they really sounded great together, and Andromeda was baller.
p5312
aVReally liking this Erra as of late, solid music and the main singer is a fucking tank!\u000a\u000aedit: removed something I know the answer to.
p5313
aVThey were good live except for the clean singer. I don't know whether it was the equipment or what but whenever he sang it was all scratchy because he was too high.
p5314
aVDefinitely sounds like it might've been the equipment, he sounded great at the show I was at
p5315
aVHe sounded fantastic in Portland. 
p5316
aVEasily one of my favorite bands right now! Does anybody know what they tune each guitar to? I noticed Jesse is playing a 6-string, but Sean is playing a 7-string. 
p5317
aVI know their old tuning was A#
p5318
aVI think they're in drop G# on the new stuff
p5319
aVSo I went to go see them last week but their van broke down and they didn't make it to the show :(
p5320
aVI remember hearing about that! That sucks so hard man.
p5321
aVI'm sorry, but is that the new cheapo Ibanez Gio RG7?
p5322
aVNope, that looks like one of the more high-end ones
p5323
aVNever heard of these guys until a couple months ago when I stumbled across Alpha Seed on 8tracks. Probably one of my new favourite bands and I can't stop listening to Augment/Moments of Clarity as of late. This song can be neatly filed into the "kicking fucking ass" section of quality heavy metal music. \u000a\u000aWhat I want to know is how Ian manages to maintain that physique while touring (and presumably eating less because of budget restrictions). I have a ton of respect for anyone who takes care of their body like that. I really wish I could have seen these guys on the FF tour, but it didn't come to Vancouver and work for grad school prevented me from going to the Seattle gig. Sad days. \u000a\u000aGJ, Erra!

p5335
aVThey do, it's just a shame both times I saw them live Kyle's voice pretty much sucked.
p5336
aVIt doesn't help that they have Dave doing cleans now too. He's just an all around better vocalist. It's really noticeable on their studio stuff too, you have his real rough singing clashing horribly with Kyle's autotuned to shit voice.
p5337
aVHe sounds a bit better on this video, but the two times I saw them in the past year his vocals were so goddamn nasally. Dave is just better sounding in general along with the screams. It's a shame that this also applies to their studio tracks. 
p5338
aVIt didn't seem particularly spectacular in this video either...\u000a\u000aI saw 'em at warped tour in 2013, and I thought they did a pretty great job. However, I tend to gloss over vocalist incompetency as long as it isn't too glaring if the rest of the instruments are really on point.

aVThe moods of the songs and technicalities in the drums change drastically while he sings. While it is still impressive, the music becomes the most basic pop beat and what he's doing is no more impressive than all the singer/songwriter types who play solo with a guitar.  \u000a  \u000a  I remember an interview about Atreyu's song writing process, and the majority of their music was told to be written by their drummer with just vocal ideas, followed up with drums, before the rest of the band gets together and shapes it into a full jam.

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

p5419
(lp5420
VI definitely know what that's like, I'm from western Massachusetts, also a vocalist, and the local scenes around here are pretty much dead. I'm 18 and can't really commit to anything too far away either. Pretty much just keep trying to find people, it's completely normal for your first few bands to fall apart. I'm going to college in Pennsylvania in the fall, and I'm hoping I'll be able to find more people there, since when I went there last summer for an ABR show, it seemed like there was a pretty good music scene there
p5421
aVYeah I agree! Thank you for the advice and input! I obviously know that some of the first bands you try will fail and fall apart, it's just I don't know I just have so much energy and excitement for performing I just want to get out, and do it. I know with the local scene in Cinci and Dayton we are definitely active (how could we not? Tons of musicians came from the scene). My issue is not only finding shows to go to, but the arrangements to get there. \u000a\u000aI'm 16, finishing driving school on Thursday and taking my test next week for my license. It's a bit hard to really get down there all the time, even though I want to so badly. 
p5422
aVYou said you live in ohio idk how far you are from columbus but if you can go to college there(if you plan on going to college) the scene there is pretty good from what i know
p5423
aVLearn guitar. That's always the hardest thing to find is a quality guitarist, who also can write. If you can play guitar then you can demo yourself, and just add drum tracks. That's what I do, because I can't find anyone in NE who wants to make a band haha
p5424
aVI am currently about to start. Overall I plan on learning Guitar, Drums, and Piano. But I've recently started to learn guitar so that's a big thing I want to do. Is get where I can play everything, so if need be I can record it all/write it all send that demo into a label, etc and have material to show off.
p5425
aVWhat part of Ohio? I'm a drummer in the Akron area 
p5426
aVDarke County which is midwest
p5427
aVI'll cut to the chase, I understand but you don't need a "metalhead" guitarist, a kid that likes rock or punk would be fine, like they don't have to like the same music as you and I'm sure some people would just be happy to be in a band. So if you have other friends who play instruments ask them, or you could ask the music department at your school and post an ad and someone could be like yeah I'd want to sign up for his band. I'm from the other side of the world to you, so culture may be different
p5428
aVAt least from my experience, working with people who don't normally listen to this sort of music never goes well, because as far as playing/writing good metalcore songs, having some familiarity/interest in the genre is sort of important
p5429
aVExactly, I know the two I was with in the original "band" I had set up they weren't into the metalcore scene that we I was looking to do. They were more into Rock and such. That's why I was looking for more people that like or atleast listen to the metalcore style.
p5430
aVEven metalcore is such a wide-ranging genre that even if everyone likes metalcore, everyone still might be going in different directions, there was one band I was in where most of the people wanted to do risecore-type stuff, but then me and one guitarist wanted to go in a more heavy, progressive direction, and that didn't go too well
p5431
aVYeah I completely agree, I know personally i'd really like to go the way of very heavy and progressive. I feel like possibly with the right people it can be done, my biggest strength that is also a weakness is always wanting everyone's opinions involved. So while I would want that, if someone else would want a rise-core type sound, i'd try to put their idea above or blended with mine. It's definatly a big thing to get through when starting a group is deciding how you want to play and the sound you want to project!
p5432
aVDefinitely, I completely agree with you, it seems like finding the right people is one of the hardest things about starting a band. It's just really frustrating, because I've put in so much work to get my vocals to a good point, and I still practice constantly, but I still don't have a band to work with yet
p5433
aVYeah I agree. I know lately I haven't gotten to do my practices every day like I was(mostly due to Drivers Ed and then trying to get my driving hours accomplished), I haven't practiced in a month so far. I know it isn't **THAT** bad but it's still bad and lose a lot of the stuff you had before. So i'm gonna start again this upcoming week once drivers ed is over, and i'm officially starting work. So i'll be able to take care of everything better.\u000a\u000aMy biggest issue is preforming at the moment, I don't want to do my aggressive vocals if i'm alone(so using an instrumental to do a cover in front of people), I just don't have it in me to do my normal moves I would if I had a band behind me(obviously in my room practicing is different cause that stuff is apart of my practice but still).
p5434
aVAh, fair enough, what I usually do to practice is play songs through speakers and scream over it, since that way I still have instrumentals going, and being able to scream though songs by bands I like helps me judge how good my vocals are, I have some stuff written too, but I can't really work on those until I have instrumental parts and can start finding good screaming patterns for them
p5435
aVYeah. That's practically what I do for practice, I have a playlist of songs I like and ways that i'd like to work my vocals to go(styles). I have a small issue with lyric writing, but it's something I work on often so hopefully my lyrics won't be garbage haha. 
p5436
aVMakes sense, one thing I've been doing a lot recently is going through bands' live setlists, sort of to see how I'd do in terms of playing shows. For shorter, opening/support bands, I sound fine pretty much the whole way through, but I'm not really at a point where I can really do headliner-length setlists yet, since my voice gets tired after a while, especially since I have a very energetic screaming style, probably my best comparison would be a mix of Garrison from Erra and Jake from ABR
p5437
aVI know I recently found setlist.fm and used that in a similar way. Before it was just open spotify, make a playlist find what songs I liked, style of vocals, etc. I know I sound pretty good with both so far while keeping my energetic stage presence. Usually I have been doing short sets though(mainly an all Beartooth support set), and such. But my "headliner" practice blends Beartooth, Of Mice &amp; Men, ATTILA, Amity Affliction, August Burns Red, Suicide Silence, Whitechapel, and Bring Me The Horizon. While some do have a "similar" style I use that as a small way to bump my way to the next style, so I don't strain or hurt my voice too much.\u000a\u000aI know once I had a full hour in a half concert(including the pep talk/talking when members would retune for the next song, etc), full on jumping/bouncing, etc.
p5438
aVYeah, makes sense, I've mostly been going through the setlists from the Frozen Flame tour, since those are all bands I really like, and have fairly similar vocal styles to me, and the shorter sets are fine, the ABR setlist is still a bit difficult, because it's so long. I can scream through their full albums fine, what I did for a while was just scream through Rescue &amp; Restore, but their full headlining set is still pretty hard to do, though on a good night I can manage it, and I feel like with the adrenaline of an actual live show, I'd do a lot better, which is one reason I've been really wanting to find a new band
p5439
aVYeah exactly! See that's the thing i've thought about to. With the adrenaline you gain from an actual show, like I feel that is going to push you and make you so much better. I haven't listened much to ABR setlist from the Frozen Flame Tour, I will probably try it out and see how I do.
p5440
aVSounds good, it's a really good setlist, with a bunch of really fun songs, it's just very tiring, especially with my screaming style
p5441
aVI'll try it out! I hope all goes well for you man! Hopefully you find a group that works out for you!
p5442
aVThanks! You too!
p5443
asVDevil Wears Prada - You Can't Spell Crap. One of my favorite songs by them.
p5444
(lp5445
VThe second half of this record is so underestimated bc it's buried after Goats, HTML and Dear John. Such a good album.
p5446
aVThis as well
p5447
aVMy favorite album by them.  It bridges the style of their first two with that of WRAABB.
p5448
aVProbably my all-time favorite song of theirs (Although I Hate Buffering is a very close second).  Really love the "higher" tone of the song (If that makes sense).
p5449
aVMissed a real chance to call it "You Can't Spell Carp"
p5450
asVWhat is an honest criticism that you can say about your favorite musician or band? (x-post /r/music)
p5451
(lp5452
VBMTH-Sempiternal. Alot of the hooks are structured the same with a each syllable said on beat with last syllable dragged out for effect. 1-2-3-foouurr  "cause im sleepwalkiiiinnngggg" chas-ing rainbooowwsss" "snakes start to siiiiinnnnggggg" "no death can tooouucchhh"\u000a\u000a\u000aIts like Hetfields "uhs' after every last syllable. Not a dealbreaker or even a fault, just can't be ignored once noticed. \u000a\u000a
p5453
aVYes! I always knew this but like subconciously. Never could put my finger on it, just new they all sounded similar.
p5454
aVMichael Bohn's screams have deteriorated.
p5455
aVYes they have.
p5456
aVERRA will never again have the inspiring well thought out lyrics that Garrison wrote that taught me at least four new words per song. Now they'll have Jesse's more emotional and loving lyrics.
p5457
aVYeah this fact sucks so much. Jesse can write some great lyrics but nothing on the level of Garrison's mind-bending writing.
p5458
aVAll I'm asking is for Jesse to use more complex words, but listening to and analyzing their vocal style has made me come to the conclusion that they can't. These words are way too hard to sing and have too many syllables. If you take for instance lyrics from some Impulse songs you'll notice Jesse doesn't sing longer words (mostly); only Garrison does. I guess that's why it'll be difficult for him to alone write for a vocalist whose style is so different.
p5459
aVThis makes me so sad, the main reason I listen to Erra is because of the poetic level of writing Garrison produces. I just hope they don't continue with Jesse's little Skin fetish he runs with in Ghost atlas.
p5460
aVBeau's voice gets on my nerves after a while
p5461
aVATB's self produced all their albums, and the only one that has been good was the reissue of Rareform, and it's still kinda quiet. In Dreams and Wolves Within aren't *bad,* but In Dreams is really flat and Wolves Within is hella compressed. 
p5462
aVSomeone said it sounds like Anthony screams through a can. I just laughed, pretty spot on. The are all fucking awesome though
p5463
aVThat was me hahaha
p5464
aVFucking hilarious hahaha 
p5465
aVBit late but I actually loved the production on Wolves Within, though I definitely agree with you about In Dreams.
p5466
aVI'll start.\u000a\u000aI find that Jesse tends to re-use a lot of keywords from KsE songs. And not just in KsE, but in ToG and ESF too.\u000a\u000aKey words like 'selfless', 'system' (referencing the government?) stand/fight together', and 'unbroken' area few of the ones i've heard a few times throughout.
p5467
aVKyle from WCAR is not a very good vocalist (though he has improved).
p5468
aVSandals. C'mon.
p5469
aVDon't you *dare* hate on those flip-flops. 
p5470
aVHaha I'm just joking. He/they could wear high heels and I'd still love em.
p5471
aVIs this about JB?\u000a\u000aEdit: Because those flip-flops are pretty badass
p5472
aVAll That Remains is pretty bad live haha. That and they definitely sold out and started making 5FDP-tier radio metal shit... But I still like it ;D
p5473
aVYeah! They pretty much did what 5FDP did now that u mention it. \u000a\u000aShame really :\u005c  but if thats the kind of music that's in their hearts, then i can't blame them for putting it out there for the world to listen. 
p5474
aVYeah, and I'm completely okay with it honestly. 5FDP was one of the bands that eased my transition into music with harsh vocals so I can't say that style doesn't appeal to me :P
p5475
aVBack when I saw them shortly after Fall of Ideals was released I thought they sounded incredible. Although I haven't seen them since. The newer stuff sucks so much though
p5476
aVJake Luhrs can be pretty hit or miss live, every time I've seen them, he's been great, but I've seen a bunch of videos where his vocals didn't sound too good
p5477
aVI don't think anyone can be amazing 100% of the time, there are always things that can go wrong, like sickness, etc. I saw them Wednesday and he was near-perfect.
p5478
aVOh I know, I've seen them 5 times and they've been amazing every time, that was just the only criticism I could really think of
p5479
aVI guess if i had to find a criticism for ABR it would be that their albums all sound very similar. Unless you're a diehard fan, it can be very easy to lose yourself in their discography.\u000a\u000aI love them, and i hope they keep doing what they do best; but their style never progresses within the scope of an entire album. Sure a song here or there might incorporate different elements, but in terms of albums, they all sound very similar.
p5480
aVI guess I'm just so familiar with them that I can easily tell the difference between the albums. There was a pretty big shift between Messengers and Constellations, but I agree that they have kept a pretty similar sound since then, though for me at least, they still change enough to stay interesting
p5481
aVI think the biggest change between those 2 albums was the production value. I mean, i can tell the difference between the albums only because i know what song i'm listening to and what song goes on what album....but style/sound-wise i feel that they're nearly identical.
p5482
aVThey also started using a lot more progressive elements on Constellations
p5483
aVI don't know that they all sound the same, but I think the ones they've put out so far could be put into a couple of groups.
p5484
aVWhat up Dallas?
p5485
aVAyyeeee
p5486
aVYou didn't happen to find an e-cig on the floor, did you? It fell out of my pocket during Miss May I. 
p5487
aVHaha nope. I was toward the front on the left side trying not to get blind-sided by a once-high school football player trying to relive his past in the pit.
p5488
aVHow bout that dude in the wheelchair? I know he ran over some peoples feet. 
p5489
aVLol he probably did. My friend said that guy has been at every concert he has been to. Impressive.
p5490
aVI didn't mind the change musically and vocal wise for The Color Morale and I like Know Hope but H.O.P.E. just got ridiculous. The lyrics are extremely Tumblr worthy at times and the music just seems uninspired. They aren't my favorite but certainly one of them. Love the band still and Garret Rapp is a great, genuine guy but it bothers me the path they are on. 
p5491
aVI totally agree with you on H.O.P.E. \u000a\u000a"Suicide doesn't end the pain, it passes to the ones you love and remains. Take yourself out of the equation ,and the problem stays."\u000a\u000aI like Suicide;Stigma, but i swear i saw that line somewhere on tumblr years ago...\u000a\u000a
p5492
aVOh, Sleeper doesn't release enough new music. That's my only complaint.\u000a\u000a
p5493
aVI third this
p5494
aVI second this.
p5495
aV* Famous Last Words's first EP was generic as fuck\u000a\u000a* Betraying the Martyrs's new album is a *major* setback\u000a\u000a* Oliver Sykes's overt atheism is super cringy\u000a\u000a* *New Demons* is the only album that I feel I See Stars has completely 100% hit the mark on. I like the earlier ones, but ND is the only perfect one imo.
p5496
aVI See Stars has always been a band that was one step away from "holy shit" good. I've always like them. Digital Renegade was awesome and the albums before that were pretty good but they really stepped it up on New Demons. Filth Friends Unite might still be my favorite song. New Demons overall sounds more like the the sound Filth Friends has I guess. 
p5497
aVDisagree on BTM
p5498
aVHmm I have a few.\u000a\u000a1.  I think Shayley sounded better in Of Mice &amp; Men, and I think if he would of stayed they wouldn't of sold out like they did in RF.  Still love Dayshell tho.\u000a\u000a2.  This one is a little broad.  I don't like solo albums.  I'm looking at you, MMF and Issues.  I love the bands, but stick to your niche.  You're not suddenly going to transition from metalcore to being the next Drake, and honestly I think it wastes the band's time and resources, even if it's not meant to.\u000a\u000a3.  This is prbly closest to the topic at hand.  Asking Alexandria was my favorite band ever.  Stand up and Scream was/is actually one of the greatest albums I've ever heard.  Reckless &amp; Relentless was also a fantastic sophomore album.  But goddamnit did they drop the ball on FDTD.  It just wasn't AA anymore, and it was actually heartbreaking.  \u000a\u000aEdit grammar*
p5499
aVTyler Carter's solo album is actually really good. 
p5500
aVHe's a fantastic vocalist, same with Mullins.  I guess my issue is that they're still actively with their band when they put these albums out, and I just feel like it takes their focus away from what made them known in the first place.  Kinda like they're just using the band as a stepping stone, and wouldn't give a second thought about leaving the band if their solo album blew up.  I could be wrong, but it's why I just don't like the feel of solo albums.
p5501
aVI guess, but I'm almost positive that Tyler did it because he wanted to. He loves that kind of music and is evidently really good at it too. Also, it's been in the works for literally 3 years.
p5502
aVThree? Try five. He blue balled me for all of high school and waited til I had graduated to release that shit. 
p5503
aVHaha yeah it's been talked about for more like 5
p5504
aVI like your perspective on solo albums. The counterargument would be that it allows for musicians to express another side of their music that they want to release. Their motivation could be extrinsic (if they wanted to become the next pop sensation and make tons of money) or truly intrinsic (they wanted to experiment with a sound outside of the scope of their music).\u000a\u000aIn general, side projects can be awesome because musicians can write and perform with other musicians to enhance their sound and creativity. However, the conflicts with this is that it has the potential to impede the original band's progress and it can homogenize their playing styles instead of enhancing it. However, some musicians don't care if the sound is similar to other bands/genres/material--they just want to jam and have fun with some other people.\u000a\u000aI do believe it is selfish for one member to have a side project going while in an active project like you said. It is awesome that they are devoted and love music enough to take both on, but if you are limiting the potential of you and your bandmates, that is bad.\u000a\u000aAn example of a side project done well would be Sons Of The Sea by Brandon Boyd of Incubus. He named it Sons Of The Sea because he didn't want people to attach his name to it and it was strictly for artistic expression. The songs were top notch, did not interfere with his band's schedule, and he gained a lot of knowledge about musicianship, songwriting, and production that will undoubtably transfer over to Incubus.\u000a\u000aThen there's Matty Mullins--personally, I believe it was a cash grab. Also, that snare drum tone combined with the uninspired lyrics and songwriting was absolutely painful for me. But hey, some people dig it and Matty seemed to enjoy it, so I don't mind.
p5505
aVCrossfaith: guitars could be techier and Ken's screaming hasn't the best range tbh, lyrics are very Engrish at times, still the best electronicore band though imo.
p5506
aVhave you heard The Browning?
p5507
aVYeah, they're quite good, guitar sound isn't great though which puts me off a little, Gravedigger though, what a tune.
p5508
aVTheir English isn't that bad. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is VERY Engrish.
p5509
aVJaegerbomb though. 
p5510
aVIce Nine Kills please just play The Greatest Story Ever Told live at one concert I go to, I know you wanna get out you're newer music but all I'm asking is for you to perform your most popular song live it's definitely the best to sing along with.\u000a\u000aCrown the Empire should really stop trying to make songs with overly autotune voices at the beginning of some songs it just sounds more like a kid messing with his voice in garage band rather than an actual band. 
p5511
aVGarret from TCM is pretty below average live, on account of him doing cleans and screams, and crowd hype. And both TCM and The Amity Afflictions lyrics are getting to... Tumblrish, with all of the suicide/self harm/my life is hard lyrics. If that's what they wasn't to write that's their business, but damn, for two of my absolute favorite bands, it gets annoying. 
p5512
aVI honestly don't like the direction BMTH is taking. I think Sempiternal is the start of them heading away from Metalcore, and I dislike that.
p5513
aVINW's second album was mediocre at best. There's a couple pretty good songs, but they didn't get anywhere close to the level of musicianship/song-writing that they got on the first album. Also: save trees.

aVLmao this is amazing
p5600
aVI feel so filthy after upvoting this...
p5601
aVThe thing that really surprises me is that now that they have moved so far away from Metalcore, what does Austin do? I mean he barely sings, and radio rock doesn't really call for entire screamed verses, so he's pretty much taking the backseat, even as the most popular person in the band. Even in this song he only pops up during the choruses, and at that his vocals are a part of the background.\u000a\u000aEdit: I lied, he screams during the bridge, too. But going from the frontman of a massive band to the guy that screams over a bridge every now and then kind of sucks.
p5602
aVI absolutely agree. I have been wondering when the time would come where he does nothing. Every one of their singles off Restoring Force puts him on the back burner. 
p5603
aVWhat? A flair with color? What is this sorcery?
p5604
aVIf you listen closely in the other songs that were released for this album, he actually does a lot of singing now, he doesnt scream as much(obviously) but hes stepping up and changing vocal styles
p5605
aVHopping on that Oli Sikes action I see. Well hey if it keeps him relevant, more power to him. Who am I to criticize when he's making money hand over hand. It's obviously working for him. 
p5606
aVAt least BMTHs change was pretty fucking good. OM&amp;M are just fucking horrid now. Aaron sounds like his balls are trying to drop.
p5607
aVI'd be willing to bet Austin was inspired by Sempiternal (or at least saw its critical and commercial success) and tried to emulate it on RF and this new stuff, but it's nowhere near as good.
p5608
aVProbably. Oli has the natural talent to pull it off is the difference. Not saying Austin isn't talented, but it's clear the band took a hit when Shayley left. I feel like they think they found their identity when all of their fan base feels they lost it.
p5609
aV&gt;I feel like they think they found their identity when all of their fan base feels they lost it.\u000a\u000aperfect way to put it
p5610
aVWould you say that they have an.... Identity disorder?
p5611
aVBOOM I was waiting for someone to say this!!!
p5612
aVHonestly I kinda chuckled to myself at how for like the first 3 minutes all he did was the "on you!" or whatever in the background.
p5613
aVYeah he sounds like the hype man for a rapper or something.
p5614
aVAh! But they can't get rid of him either because then they lose the fan girls! 
p5615
aVYou're saying the best course of action is to kick him out of OM&amp;M so that he can reunite the one true Metalcore band - Attack Attack!? The circle would be complete.
p5616
aVThe shit that would be lost if that ever happened...
p5617
aVI feel like fangirls all over the globe would unite and form one massive, hot topic shredded jeans wearing, jet black haired, studded belted monster to be stopped by one man and one man alone - Caleb Shomo.
p5618
aVCan someone send this to\u000aCaleb and request it as the next Beartooth video??
p5619
aVWhen my mom tells me I can't get Warped Tour tickets, I'll listen to this song and never give up my hopes to one day see Austin Carlile live. 
p5620
aVWow you're such a bandwagoner. When I'm sad I listen to their underrated gems such as "Ur Not Aloen".
p5621
aVI'm not even surprised at how terrible they are at this point. 
p5622
aVI can actually enjoy Of Mice &amp; Men when I accept the fact that they are no longer metalcore. 
p5623
aVThis sounds so much like Linkin Park to me, holy shit
p5624
aVSame here, but in the end, it doesn't even matter. 
p5625
aVLol I wonder how long its going to take before we stop posting their songs because they aren't even metalcore anymore.
p5626
aVHoly Breaking Benjamin, Batman!
p5627
aVThis new sound of theirs makes me so torn.\u000a\u000aI loved their first two albums, didn't care for restoring force, and now it's this.\u000a\u000aI really like Breaking Benjamin, Red, and Old LP, among others, so I actually like Broken Generation, but considering where the band came from, and the sound they gave up, its disheartening.
p5628
aVI've had that before, like, I would love the song if it weren't for the fact of the band that made it, and how drastically it changes from the reason I loved the band to begin with. 
p5629
aVI completely agree with you. I grew up on LP, A7X, 3DG, Breaking Benjamin, and Red. Although I don't listen to it much anymore, I still have the appreciation for a good radio rock song. \u000a\u000aI am not, however, a huge fan of old OM&amp;M. Just can't get into it. But based on my old tastes, I have a hard time calling their new songs *terrible* just because they went radio rock. \u000a\u000aLike if this came out in 2009, and I had no prior knowledge of this band, I'd probably jam the shit out of it. 
p5630
aVI don't know if it's because it's a leaked version of the song or what, but it just sounds... bad. Mixing wise.
p5631
aVThe first released song had pretty good mixing. I'm willing to bet the official release will be much better
p5632
aVYes, there was another link to a better version that leaked about 2 weeks ago, I'm not sure if it was taken down or not. I can't find it, but it was definitely better production wise than this one.
p5633
aVAs a big fan of the albums that OM&amp;M and Jamie's Elsewhere had released so far, I was really excited about Aaron joining OM&amp;M.\u000a\u000aSo much wasted potential, such a shame.
p5634
aVI don't get it. How is Restoring Force and this new stuff so terrible compared to The Flood Reissue songs? There have been literally 0 lineup changes and I was so excited to see where they were headed after they released the reissue songs.\u000a\u000aOh well.
p5635
aVAaron Pauley wasn't on the The Flood reissue, just Austin
p5636
aVEven so, Aaron's presence alone wouldn't create this big of a change. I'm just disappointed, I guess.
p5637
aVAgreed. I thought Aaron would have made them *better*. Silly me. 
p5638
aVthey left joey sturgis which is the reason the music style changed btw
p5639
aVIf Joey Sturgis produced (or wrote, idk) Restoring Force/the new songs it/they would have still sucked
p5640
aVhe wouldn't have written the songs on restoring force/the new songs though, he actually knows how to create music that metalcore fans like.
p5641
aVcall him up and tell him I want zombie ep 2. If he refuses, i'll settle for werewolf ep, alien ep, vampire ep, or bigfoot ep. I *will not* accept loch ness monster ep, because that's just stupid.

aVJust imagine the imagery of this monster rising out of the water and attacking people on boats..\u000a\u000aI'm just picturing this breakdown build-up, then the music cuts out, and we just hear a nasty scream going "There...she...ISSSSSSS!!!! Blegh!!"
p5645
aVMaybe, but every time you see him he'd ask for about tree fiddy, and I don't want to deal with that.
p5646
aVSo its not that Rise wants another band to run at mainstream rock radio? I don't think its *solely* the fact that OM&amp;M left Sturgis, and a producer change might not have even been their choice. 
p5647
aVthey've said that the producer change was their decision, I think they wanted to go a more mainstream radio rock direction and I'm not sure if it was rise's idea or OM&amp;M's.
p5648
aVHm. Okay. I just find it hard to believe that such a drastic change occurred between the re-issue of the Flood and RF without Rise having some input on the creative direction. 
p5649
aVIt's not the line up, it's the style of music. Listen to The Depths then listen to You're not Alone. The difference is night and day.
p5650
aVRight. Which is why I don't get it! In my opinion they were on the right track with songs like The Depths and The Flood and then they just went a completely different direction. It's too bad.
p5651
aVOoooh, my bad I thought you were saying they haven't really changed. I was about to start throwing punches. 
p5652
aVYeah I guess my comment kind of sounds like that. I'm dumb haha I definitely think they've changed and I definitely think it's been for the worse! 
p5653
aVI was excited when I heard "The Storm" a few years back because it seemed like a great new direction. This album was disappointing but its not as bad as this sub's putting it out to be. 
p5654
aVWith the way the vocals have been utilized this past year I can comfortably say there is not a ***less*** dynamic or entertaining frontman duo in the scene. Credit in part to this tired, safe genre of course.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNothing left to see here. Wake me up me when the Alan Ashby #Rockstar AXE line hits shelves.\u000a
p5655
aV:(
p5656
aVAt this point do we have any idea what Austin does besides being Aarons bitch? 
p5657
aV[deleted]
p5658
aVGreat song by Three Days Grace!
p5659
aVI liked restoring force. I did. But this is too far. If I wanted to listen to seether I'd listen to seether 
p5660
aVI dig this song. Sure it's a bit hard rock-y. Like Post grunge. Whatever. It's catchy, and it's still OM&amp;M. I do wish they'd go back to a heavier sound. But I'm fine with however they move forward. There are plenty of other heavy bands out there.
p5661
aVJesus Christ this is shit.
p5662
aVI actually kinda like this but it's not metalcore. If I'm gonna be honest can we just stop posting new OM&amp;M now. Like honestly it's getting old they're not metalcore anymore it sucks to admit but the comment threads are all the same it's just a circlejerk of life saved or complaints about how they use to be good. If Avenged Sevenfold came out with a single tomorrow it wouldn't get posted here so i think we should start doing the same for this band.
p5663
aVNot gunna lie, i actually dig their style now, bones exposed was hard to get into and i still dont like it, but i listened to the songs put out for this album so far, minus this one, i liked the others, so what if people arent liking their change, theyre makn what they wanna make, theyre not metalcore anymore, obviously, theyre trying for the nu-metal sound it seems, and theyre almost there and i like it
p5664
asVCan fan girls ruin a band for you?
p5665
(lp5666
VI mean not really. Who am I to declare that young girls aren't allowed to like whatever bands I'm into? I mean there was a time when PTV were basically only popular with male posthardcore dorks and looking at how successful they are now I'd say that targeting the other 50% of the hardcore demographic was a really slick business decision.
p5667
aV&gt; I mean there was a time when PTV were basically only popular with male posthardcore dorks\u000a\u000athat...was me\u000a\u000aand i still like them, things have changed since 07 though.

p5669
aVhttp://www.stuffyouwillhate.com/2014/07/pierce-the-veil-most-jocked-band-2023/
p5670
aVi don't mind them. i'm just happy a band i like has a bunch of fans. especially if i've been listening to them for a few years. doesn't change the way i see the music. when i listen to a band that has a ton of fangirls that isn't what i think about. i just enjoy the album/song/etc.\u000a\u000aHOWEVER, the shows are completely different. it does change the environment. that can ruin some of the movement of the show (stage diving, crowdsurfing, moshing) but it certainly doesn't hinder the performance of the band. just watching them is a-ok too as long as you ignore the hundreds of WOOOOOOO girls every time the vocalist says something. 
p5671
aVand who cares if you are meeting chicks who listen to the same music?
p5672
aVWell to be fair most "fangirls" are under 18 but (in my opinion) going out of the way to pick up girls at hardcore shows is pretty inadvisable for a variety of reasons anyway. Plus in my experience you see just as much or more crowdsurfing and miscellaneous craziness at a SWS show as at an ABR show so the 'shows with lots of girls are less fun' mindset doesn't hold much water as far as I'm concerned.
p5673

aVAge of consent is less than 18 in many states...
p5680
aVIts a fine time to be 17
p5681
aVYeah I agree with you, its just not as fun at a live show such when you can't crowd surf or you have to be especially careful in a mosh.
p5682
aVThey don't ruin the band, but they have definitely ruined a few gig experiences. I rarely see metalcore bands because their fans usually infuriate me so much, both guys and girls.
p5683
aVI once saw a BVB show...no one knew the lyrics except for me. Worst concert.
p5684
aVNot at all. The bands music is the only thing that determines if I listen to them or not. Not what they do as people or what their fans do. 
p5685
aVThis is the best attitude. Music is music. If you like it, you like it. Doesn't matter who it is "supposed" to pander to by societal standards.
p5686
aVThis is the only answer there should be. Bands dont really choose their own fanbase.
p5687
aVthey just make me ignore all the shtty fanart and comments
p5688
aVI was a little worried of this on a BMTH + Pierce the Veil gig. During PtV the crowd seem to be all fan girls and woo's but as soon as BMTH got on stage dozens if not a hundred older guys came out of from nowhere and took over the crowd. It was kind of beautiful.
p5689
aVMost of the fangirls don't like BMTH, now that Oli isn't that super scene kid he used to be. Unless you are at warped tour, but that tends to be a crap ton of fan girls at every set. 
p5690
aV[deleted]
p5691
aVProbably less of them now too since he's engaged.
p5692
aVplus he's like 30 now\u000a\u000athen again, so is vic fuentes
p5693
aVThat is pretty awesome
p5694
aVI'll just say this: Black Veil Brides would be fantastic if it weren't for the fan base and singer (I just don't like his vocal style. I don't feel like it matches) the music is actually really good, but it's so heavy handed how much they pander to that 13 year old "trying to be edgy gonna draw scars on my mouth to make people think I'm mysterious and edgy and cool" demographic. If it weren't for those two things, they'd actually be great to be a fan of, because the musicians are actually incredibly talented.
p5695
aVI would have to say yes. I went and saw attila and a 15 year old girl kicked me in the balls because she got pushed. i don't mind them too much but they need to realize if there going to shove their way to the front then they should expect to be shoved and pushed with all the moshing and crowed surfing going on. Also its jut kind of lame being in my 20s and going to a show and and feeling like a grandfather there
p5696
aV"Break shit\u000aFuck the law\u000aFuck this shit\u000aPunch that bitch"\u000aBut seriously, good self restraint on your side

p5701
aVOr Eddie Hermida, but we can agree to disagree
p5702
aVbutthurt mitchbitch detected\u000a\u000aeverything Eddie did with ASP put suicide silence to SHAME. While it's unfortunate that Mitch died, You Can't Stop Me was the best suicide silence album since the Cleansing

p5707
aVExpressing his opinion is fine.\u000a\u000a&gt; butthurt mitchbitch detected\u000a&gt; \u000a\u000aHowever this is why he should be downvoted. Insulting others because they expressed their opinion isn't cool.
p5708
aVHe's being downvoted for being a douche, not for his opinion.
p5709
aV[deleted]
p5710
aVLol okay. I liked You Can't Stop Me but to say he put Mitch to shame is ignorant in itself. Mitch had better vocals than 99% of deathcore/metalcore both on album and in live performance. I don't know if you've ever seen Eddie live but he doesn't live up to Mitch and never will.
p5711
aVDo you even deathcore? 99% of vocalists are better than Mitch, not the other way around
p5712
aVAnd that's your opinion, his vocals are what made me really listen to deathcore in the first place. It's okay to like different things 
p5713
aVyea, Suicide Silence is a great beginners deathcore band, but to say they're the best in any category is just confusing
p5714
aVu wot m9\u000a\u000ahow can you say that when Phil Bozeman is a person that exists\u000a\u000aI've seen both live and while Mitch definitely had a better stage presence Eddie's, he went above and beyond the bar set up by Mitch
p5715
aVI like Whitechapel but I don't think Phil is the best, sorry. Don't crucify me. \u000a\u000aFor my money, Mitch was the best live and Studio scream there was. Since he's gone I would say Rick from TOTA, Landon from Plot, Sam from Architects, or Ryan from Fit For A King are where my money would best be spent. That's my personal opinion though! I'm not trying to force my beliefs on you
p5716
aVI honestly don't get the Landon worship on this sub. He sounds like every other Risecore vocalist
p5717
aV&gt; Mitch had better vocals than 99% of deathcore/metalcore both on album and in live performance.\u000a\u000aWAT

aVI had a weird epiphany not too long ago when I realized that My Chemical Romance actually had a lot of really good songs, and I had only dismissed them because of their fans. I mean their image was cheesy for sure, and I still hate their last Killjoys album, but songs like Thanks for the Venom, Ghost of You, How I Disappear, etc. are really great examples of catchy but solid punk rock. They were good musicians and songwriters that just got bogged down with the emo scene, and probably Gerard's ego. 
p5722

p5725
aV[deleted]
p5726
aVJust to echo what most people in this thread have said: they don't ruin a band for me if the music is still fine (like PTV, BMTH, ADTR even WCAR), but what typically happens is that these bands gain such a huge following, and whether its the constant touring, or the realization that they don't need to make good heavy music anymore (looking at you SWS, and OMAM) those band tend to fall off the rails a bit. And I completely echo the sentiment that they ruin shows. Completely, 100%. I'm at the PTV/SWS World Tour, just trying to get into Beartooth, and I have all these girls complaining we're getting to violent (trying to start pits). Then the entire show turns into people complaining that they're being squished and getting hot and sweaty. I'm still the guy who puts on his shitty clothes for a show because I want to go hard and get nasty and sweaty and a little beaten up. But all these girls show up all prissed up and wanting to sit in the front row...ugh. It kills me. Same shit always happens at Warped unless you're seeing something on a stage that doesn't draw girls. Sorry for my rant, I just felt really deprived that I could lose my shit to Beartooth. 
p5727
aVDude, Beartooth is top of my list of bands to see. They havent come to Australia yet so I'm still waiting. Hopefully they don't tour with some typical scene-kid bands.
p5728
aVFingers crossed, God i want to see them so bad, maybe they could bring The Ghost Inside or vis versa I'd be so stocked :3
p5729
aVThat would be amazing, The Ghost Inside, Beartooth, Northlane and Bury Tomorrow would be a dream tour
p5730
aVFor me, it's based on how the band reacts to those fan girls. I still like bands like The Devil Wears Prada, Chelsea Grin, etc. that all have their share of bad fan girls, but if the bands don't try to market their music directly to those fan girls and make everything solely about profiting off of that demographic, I don't really mind.
p5731
aVI've always felt as though Prada has somehow managed to shoo away fangirls, at least the ones that we all probably find generally obnoxious.
p5732
aVGenerally they do. 
p5733
aVI don't really mind except at shows sometimes. The ones who want to be in the middle of the crowd but piss and moan when people mosh or start a push pit just irritates the fuck out of me. If you wanna go to shows your gonna have to get used to being pushed around a bit or get to the back.
p5734
aVYes. Of mice and men.  Case closed.
p5735
aVI think it's the other way around..\u000a\u000aAs a band develops (often into a different direction than the "old" stuff), the new music might attract "fan girls".\u000a\u000aFor me bands like that either die a honorable dead (I still like the old stuff but won't go to shows or buy new stuff until they go "back to the roots") or I continue listen to them if I like the new stuff.\u000a\u000aE.G. for the first case: BMTH. I can't stand that hard-pop stuff they're doing lately..\u000aE.G. for the 2nd case: Rise Against. They've gotten progressively softer, but I still like most things they do. So, why not?\u000a\u000aOn concerts.. Just stay away from these kind of people and you'll be fine.
p5736
aVYou didn't like the black market?
p5737
aVAs I said, I like all the albums. It's just that they have gotten softer and softer over the time.
p5738
aVStill so good though ^_^
p5739
aVIt can kill a live show for sure. Way back in like 2005 I went to see Story of the Year. By no means was I expecting it to be a crazy show with a huge pit or anything, but I heard they put on a really good live show so I wanted to check it out. \u000a\u000aBand was great, audience was like 95% scene chicks, and me and a couple of my friends standing there. The audience definitely killed the show for me even though they sounded and played really good. 
p5740
aVThis is a fair question. Most of the shows I've been to recently have been all fan girls. It bothers me some, because they just go to the front and don't jump or move and get when people by them bump into them. \u000aThe difference between when I saw Issues headline and the whole crowd was fan girls to a very diverse crowd at a Beartooth show was night and day for me
p5741
aV[deleted]
p5742
aVNah I don't really care, I'll listen to whatever I want. What bothers me more is the endless bitching I see on Facebook and YouTube when a band changes their line-up or style. 
p5743
aVNot really, as long as the band's music is still good. The only issue I have is when a band changes their sound (coughcough Of Mice &amp; Men and The Color Morale) to appeal more to the fangirls, and the quality of the music goes down greatly
p5744
aVbut what if they think that we ruin shows for them?
p5745
aVWe've also forgotten to mention that fan girls actually buy music, posters, dvds, magazines. Metal head guys steal the music, talk shit, pout at live shows and bitch about triggers in drums in YouTube. Fan girls are the only things worth doing it for
p5746
aVI listen to the gear nerd technical side of metalcore mostly, like Periphery, Protest The Hero, After The Burial, Veil of Maya and such, so it's not usually a problem. However, those bands who do have fanbases like that usually don't get on my nerves, unless they're really preachy about it.
p5747
aVGood fucking god yes. \u000a\u000aI went to see OM&amp;M last year and I was like the only dude there, I was being elbowed senseless by 14 year old girls. So yeah, that sucked.\u000a\u000aWhen I really like a band I tend to follow the members on social media, and I've had to unfollow members from bands like OM&amp;M, Pierce The Veil, MMF.... because their social media is just mad full of fan girls and "Wrists are for bracelets, not cutting" kinda quotes. Especially Matty Mullins. Fuck Matty Mullins.\u000a\u000aI mean, yeah, obviously these fan girls can like whoever they want and they're entitled to, but they can just be really annoying.
p5748
aVHaha, fuck Matty Mullins and fuck tumblr, the source for the "meaningful quotes"
p5749
aVMatty Mullins is a terrible person!
p5750
aVMatty Mullins hates babies! Who hates babies??
p5751
aVNo, I really don't care who else likes the band. However I tend to gravitate away from bands like PTV who direct their music towards that demographic. As for live shows security and push pits have ruined more shows for me than excited teenage girls ever will. 
p5752
aVFor me it's not the fangirls itself, but how the bands handle them. Case in point, bands like Avenged Sevenfold or Black Veil Brides. I like the music for the most part, but I feel I would like it more if the band members weren't walking around like god's last gift. That being said, I suppose fans can turn me off, too. It took me forever to give bands like Tool or Opeth a chance because they were constantly being shoved down my throat. They didn't live up to the hype.
p5753
aVThe guys over with Avenged Sevenfold actually seem like pretty genuine dudes
p5754
aVwhile I agree that Opeth fans are annoying, trying to claim that albums like [My Arms Your Hearse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9X7BYsKUIc) aren't incredible is wishful thinking
p5755
aVADTR has a ton of fangirls, and I still love them. As a general rule, though, I find that bands with a huge "scene" following or whatever end up not sounding as good. I've never liked either Oli Sykes's or Austin Carlile's vocal style. The same goes for bands like BVB and Falling In Reverse. Not to mention the fact that all the members of those kinds of bands are tools.
p5756
aV[deleted]
p5757
aVWhat Pop Punk bands are you being put off out of interest?
p5758
aVI still enjoy them, but two bands that come to mind are State Champs and Neck Deep. I know their lyrics gravitate towards a female audience, but still, they're pop punk bands where the crowd should be doing more then standing still and screaming
p5759
aVNot at all honestly.  Nothing stops me from liking a band or a song other than the way that band/song sounds.
p5760
aVNah, not really. I did at one point, but then I realized that disliking a band for that reason is petty.
p5761
aVThey do for elitists.
p5762
aVI honestly get more fed up with the people who judge a band based on the fangirls than the fangirls themselves.\u000a\u000aGranted, there are times when it impacts the live set, and it's annoying as hell, but overall as long as the music is good, that's all I care about.\u000a\u000aBut in the context of bands changing their sound to please their fangirls (I'm looking at you SWS), then yes, they can ruin the band for me.\u000a\u000aBlessthefall gained quite a few fangirls when they came out with "Hey baby" but theyre still my second favorite band. Moreso than ever in fact.
p5763
aVNo, but they can certainly ruin a show. 
p5764
aVThey are ruining TAA for me. I cant even wear my TAA shirt without having emo girls ask me if I listen to them. OF FUCKING COURSE I LISTEN TO THEM.
p5765
aVThe worst part is when you have been a fan for a long time, Ive listened to TAA since Severed Ties and now all these scene kids are hoping on the bandwagon thinking that their songs are directly about them.
p5766
aVI'll admit, I haven't listened to them for that long, but I was a fan of them far before Let The Ocean Take Me. They are an awesome band that used to make super great lyrics, but they have been infected with hopecore.\u000a\u000aStill seeing them with in hearts wake on valentines day.
p5767
aVYour in for a hell of a show dude, saw them both two weeks ago. As long as you are able to manage avoiding the fan girls of course. Both are some of the best live bands I've ever seen.
p5768
aVSick! Now I'm pumped haha
p5769
aVFangirls being fans of a band don't bother me - they don't ruin the band for me at all.  However, they may ruin the concert experience.  That time ABR co-headlined with AA? Nooooo.  I went to Frozen Flame this year and it was fine.\u000a\u000aBy the way, I am a girl.

aVHell yea! I heard somewhere that these guys were breaking up. Is that true or are they just on a hiatus? I'd hate to see them call it quits.

aVCan't stop listening to this album. Linger is probably my favorite track off it :D
p5850
aVWow, I really enjoyed that. Please tell me their other stuff is as heavy and also doesn't have whiny ass clean vocals. 
p5851
aVThe only song that really has a good bit of cleans is Floorboards, most of the album is heavy, I really like it.
p5852
aVThis album is absolutely fantastic. Their cleans are tolerable but the huge british accent makes it hard to be tolerable
p5853
aVAs someone who loved Blood Brothers and wants to check out that album, what is the ratio of cleans to screams? 
p5854
aV2:8 Maybe even 1:9. Floorboards is the only song that has quite a bit of cleans. Blood Brothers is 100% my favorite song on the album.

p5867
asVAn unpopular opinion thread but with a twist, only upvote with what you disagree with.
p5868
(lp5869
VAll That Remains's newest album is actually really fucking good. Ignore what people have said, get rid of any connotations you might have of them selling out, etc. And just listen to this album front to back (on iTunes First Play). There's heavy hitting songs like Tru-Kvlt-Metal and No Knock that get your blood boiling with rage, there's melodic ballads like For You, adrenaline pumping fast songs like Victory Lap. One cannot deny the great musicianship in songs like Bite My Tongue, amazing guitar solo and a beautiful jazz-esque section. The album goes out on a great note with Criticism and Self-Realization, one of my favorites of the album. Heavy, scream-y verses and a beautiful soaring melody in the chorus, with the ominous piano outro that almost lets the album wrap around itself with This Probably Won't End Well (which, while I wasn't a fan of the song at first, it really grew with me and is one of my favorites).\u000a\u000aNow that's not to say the album doesn't have his faults cause at times the lyrics can be a bit cringe-y, such as The Greatest Generation. Other times the melodies just don't seem all that right, like on Pernicious (however I really like that song as well).  \u000a\u000aOverall, if you ask me, this album takes a third place seat behind For We Are Many (The Fall of Ideals in first obviously). Yeah, their last album sucked, but I think this album takes some of those less popular "radio-friendly" ideas and improves them, makes it something actually interesting to listen to. So don't just dismiss this album off of what you heard about the band, and if you have already listened to it, listen to it again. Some of the songs did take me a few listens, but now I really love the album as a whole.

p5896
aVare u a christian
p5897
aVYeah, but I listen to stuff that definitely isn't Christian as well. I just prefer more positive lyrical content.
p5898
aVI'm with you... sort of. I'm a Christian and a For Today fan as well (not MMF), and I think positivity can be very uplifting. But in general, I prefer darker, more aggressive lyrics and sounds. Impending Doom is a good example. 
p5899
aVI love me some Impending Doom
p5900
aVPeople really hate MMF and For Today because of their lyrics? Wow.
p5901
aVPeople think Matty Mullins is a douche (since this is the unpopular opinion thread, I guess I'll let it be known that I honestly don't think he is, and yes I know what he said), some people also think MMF is boring (also disagree, but understand why people don't like their music). \u000a\u000aFor Today had the anti-gay incident with their previous guitar player, but I don't hold the band accountable for it, especially since Mattie Montgomery apologized and offered a phone number for people who were offended by the statement to call him on. I could however see how people wouldn't want to listen to For Today, they have very few songs that don't deal with Christianity.
p5902
aVThey're a Christian band, of course. Their lyrics are related heavily to religion, but regardless, if you're going to let lyrics decide whether or not to listen to *good* music, that's just wrong. Music is music, whether or not you agree with the lyrics. I am fan of BMTH's Sepitermal album, and that is heavily associated to atheism. Regardless of my views, I believe a good song/band is a good song/band.\u000a\u000aIn terms of MMF, I know what Mattie said, and I don't think he's in the wrong for it, personally. He said what he believes, and he didn't state it out right, he just said what he believed.
p5903
aVI completely agree with you personally, I just meant that I know other people are turned off to For Today because of their lyrics, which I think is as ridiculous as not liking a BMTH song because it is against religion. As a Christian, I think if a BMTH song can change your outlook on your religion, you probably weren't that religious in the first place
p5904
aVWell considering I don't believe in God, it would make sense for me not to listen to a band that only writes music about God. Why is that so strange?
p5905
aVThat's not strange, I completely understand. My point is saying that a band is bad purely on their political/religious stance, while not even caring about how good the music actually is. Sure, For Today is an extremely religious band, but their music is actually really good, if you don't mind the lyrics that much. People saying otherwise, BECAUSE of their lyrics, is just absurd.
p5906
aVI disagree that the music is that good either, all of their songs sound the same.
p5907
aVI can't tell if sarcasm or serious....
p5908
aVif a metalcore song doesnt have chugs i really have a hard time caring about it.  Its almost like the way i view EDM or trap shit. without a drop its boring...\u000a\u000aIts not that i dislike songs without them its just that I LOVE songs with chugs out the ass and theyre clearly the best for live events.\u000a\u000aAlso. Structures was my favorite band BAR NONE and their albums were flawless.
p5909
aVI had to upvote for the Structures comment, but I actually agree with the rest. \u000a\u000aI was actually just talking about this with my wife Thurday. I get the a non-stop open chord, dissonant chug song is unappealing to a lot of people, and some cases even myself, but its a necessary part of the genre. I feel like since metalcore is a fusion of harcore and metal, you are going to have things like that. \u000a\u000aThere are bands that stick closer to the "metal" side of that fusion, and bands that are much closer to "hardcore", but you don't really see any bitching about the more "metal" stuff, and what you do see is much more casual than the constant "chugga chugga crap-core" you see. \u000a\u000aI am all over the map with my tastes, and even in the last year I have branched out a lot to try and listen to stuff I outright hated before, so I don't really understand where its coming from. There's not really any one part of this style of music I 100% can't stand. The trouble is that genres and styles are fluid, styles more than genres. You can split up a lot of what's posted here to different, smaller, more specific genres, but it just seems needlessly tedious. Some stylistic differences are clearly genre changing, like why Carnifex is deathcore, but Born of Osiris is Deathcore/Metalcore. \u000a\u000a\u000aI've wandered pretty far off topic, but I took my adderall today, so thats what you get.
p5910
aVi miss adderall tangents hahaha. me and my friend started playing a game of nhl14 and midway through the first paused it to exchange some music which ended in him burning like 25 cds for his car of a buncha bands i sent him.

aVWhen I got on my computer I was going to play far cry, but instead I came to /r/metalcore
p5912
aVSempiternal is not good, and I honestly don't see it as a metalcore album. 
p5913
aVHaha, you *absolutely* have my upvote ;)
p5914
aVHey thanks! 
p5915
aVwhat makes you think it isn't a metalcore album? what genre do you think it is?
p5916
aVI think it's a mix between metalcore and (mostly) post hardcore? Songs like Hospital For Souls, Go To Hell, Seen It All Before for example. And the Deathbeds EP especially, even though that doesn't really count.
p5917
aVI agree with your original statement, but IMO there is very little post-hardcore on the album. It's metalcore with a lot of softer influences (different rock subgenres, pop, electronic etc.) to the extent that some song aren't metalcore anymore, and some are "soft metalcore". But that definitely doesn't equal to post-hardcore as a lot of people seem to think these days. Post-hardcore is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ge6ttcFrvA).
p5918
aVThank you for your link. At The Drive-In is real post-hardcore. I also like Glassjaw quite a lot too.
p5919
aV&gt;I think it's a mix between metalcore and (mostly) post hardcore? \u000a\u000aIt would still be metalcore though, post-hardcore can't contain metal/metalcore elements and still be considered post-hardcore. It becomes metalcore when it does.
p5920
aVPost metalcore mate.
p5921
aVNorma Jean master race
p5922
aVI found it to be more post hardcore. Obviously it has metalcore influence but when I hear it musically then take into account oli's vocals it just seems post hardcore.
p5923
aVit's the other way around, there's post-hardcore/post-rock influence infused into the metalcore songs.
p5924
aVYou know I think you're right for the most part. I just finished giving it another listen. Genre's are annoying because it can be subjective but it really shouldn't matter. Coming from someone who's favorite band used to be bmth I just don't enjoy sempiternal like the others, it's not unbearable by any means though. Just can't get into it. 
p5925
aVI agree with you, I love Count your Blessings-There is a hell, but I'm not the hugest fan of Sempiternal. Really not a fan of genres, I just listen to music that I think sounds good, whether that be Kayne West, Taylor Swift, or Whitechapel, and Sempiternal just doesn't do it for me. 
p5926
aVSame here man. I'll listen to some new Taylor Swift ( \u0361 \u035c\u0296 \u0361)
p5927
aVI can see how people think it is a phenomenal album, but I personally find it dull and uninspired
p5928
aVIt was a letdown for me after waiting so long to hear new material. It's good in it's own respect but it's not for me! 
p5929
aVBMTH is basically a shit band altogether.

aVHave an upvote good sir.

aVwait. Because you agree or disagree? im confused now
p5932
aVWhole-heartedly disagree, but you can only upvote what you disagree with. BMTH are fantastic.
p5933
aVwell i agree ofc they are my favorite band by far, I just didnt know if people do the reverse thing with the replies also
p5934
aVI wasn't sure either to be honest haha.
p5935
aVYeah, I agree that it's not metalcore, it's more posthardcore, but I love it. I think it's fantastic, borderline masterpiece.
p5936
aVMost people don't see it as a metalcore album. 
p5937
aVActually like everyone does
p5938
aVI just think there are too many post hardcore style songs? 
p5939
aVAre they even a metalcore band anymore? The album has some songs that fit the profile, but they've been moving away from the genre steadily. I don't mind that they're posted here, and I expect they will be for quite some time given their popularity, but I don't really see them as players in scene anymore, strictly speaking.
p5940
aVpretty much every song is metalcore except And The Snakes Start To Sing
p5941
aVI knew you'd show.\u000a\u000aEven Chasing Rainbows? \u000a\u000aI like them, and the album btw, it just seems like they are really blurring the lines. I'm open to being wrong though, what genre a band is considered as can often vary from person to person anyway.
p5942
aV&gt;Even Chasing Rainbows? \u000a\u000aChasing Rainbows wasn't on Sempiternal.

aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_-jEk4UC60
p5945
aVthanks but i got this one with the iTunes deluxe version of sempiternal, chasing rainbows isnt on iTunes at all thats why i never heard of it
p5946
aVIt's on mine, but I got mine from a friend, so I dunno.\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: scratch that, it's on the deluxe edition, which I must have, and not known
p5947
aVya\u000a\u000ahttp://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/oli-sykes-of-bring-me-the-horizon-talks-sempiternal-movies-and-more/10565341\u000a\u000a&gt;&gt;Do the songs on The Deathbeds EP follow the through line?\u000a\u000a&gt;We didn't have any B-sides, but we had a lot of ideas so we put those ideas together and made a couple of songs. They don't fit in with what Sempiternal is. They're actually quite different. The lyrical content isn't connected in that sense. I was really pleased with those songs. It felt like a well-oiled machine. I think they're really strong.
p5948
aVNeat. \u000a\u000aYou know if VtN weren't the hottest new thing on the scene you could flair up as our resident BMTH expert. 
p5949
aVYes it is, it's a bonus song on the (I believe) deluxe edition of Sempiternal.
p5950
aVIt's off of the Deathbeds EP and isn't a part of Sempiternal.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/oli-sykes-of-bring-me-the-horizon-talks-sempiternal-movies-and-more/10565341\u000a\u000a&gt;&gt;Do the songs on The Deathbeds EP follow the through line?\u000a\u000a&gt;We didn't have any B-sides, but we had a lot of ideas so we put those ideas together and made a couple of songs. They don't fit in with what Sempiternal is. They're actually quite different. The lyrical content isn't connected in that sense. I was really pleased with those songs. It felt like a well-oiled machine. I think they're really strong.\u000a\u000aIt's only on the Deluxe edition because you need to release at least 2 extra songs on an album in order to release it in certain countries like Japan and do special iTunes releases/Hot Topic releases.
p5951
aVThey're essentially the UK's answer to 30 Seconds To Mars these days, in my opinion. Luckily Suicide Season is still there to remind me how good they used to be.
p5952
aVExactly. Sempiternal wasn't horrifying to listen to or anything, I just absolutely cannot get into it. I think people are lying to themselves if they think it's straight up metalcore. 
p5953
aVwhat is straight up metalcore?
p5954
aVEverything except for bmth
p5955
aV&amp;gt;Everything except for bmth\u000a\u000a&amp;gt;Everything \u000a\u000aSnarky Puppy confirmed best metalcore of 2015
p5956
aVIt's funny when you corejerk guys joke around with people but not when someone makes one joke about bmth. Oh no 
p5957
aVI dont like bmth at all, I dont care if you like them or not, but that doesnt make them not metalcore 
p5958
aVI never said they weren't. I said sempiternal wasn't, which I said was wrong. 
p5959
aVYeah but BMTH saved my life,  so...
p5960
aVYou were on ketamine weren't u
p5961
aVWell if I want to call myself a true BMTH fan I need to do literally everything Oli does. So yes.
p5962
aV\u005c&gt;dodging the question
p5963
aVLol. I think we've already established my opinions. I'm just having fun man. I'll make an edit to say straight up metalcore would be something like august burns red (just one example)
p5964
aVmathcore sux ass
p5965
aVnow im just angry
p5966
aVYou've got me...
p5967
aVI'm genuinely hyped for Design The Skyline's new album.\u000a\u000aBonus: I'm not a fan of DTS to begin with.
p5968
aVThey're still around?
p5969
aVThey reunited a few months back...
p5970
aVI almost downvoted just because the information in your comment is that upsetting to me, but my conscience kicked in.
p5971
aVI'm not the biggest fan of ETID
p5972
aVI'm guessing not a fan of Converge either
p5973
aVI actually really like Converge. It's just ETID that I don't like.
p5974
aVFair enough, I can understand why people don't like them.
p5975
aVI only like their Hot Damn! Album
p5976
aVThis thread is so confusing! Ahhh!
p5977
aVJob done ;)
p5978
aVI love synth-core breakdowns and mindless chugging.
p5979
aVDo you wanna listen to Genesi[s] by WIM with me?
p5980
aVI was thinking of Someday Came Suddenly. The synths on that album are amazing, deep, and artistic. Damn, I sure do love me some 2008 crabcore...
p5981
aVAnd if you don't like those lyrics you can go listen to Genesis.
p5982
aVSEGA, We ain't playin' games.
p5983
aVWhoa, this comment, in combination with copyrytedlizzerd's, made me realize that this song is referring to Woe is Me, and not Phil Colins' band. It makes so much more sense now...
p5984
aVI was confused by this for a while, too. I thought Issues' distaste for Phil Collins was kinda uncalled for.
p5985
aVWhen it comes to chug, only trains chug harder than Genesi[s].
p5986
aVI actually kinda like it besides the lyrics and the cleans.
p5987
aVYeah, I like it as well. Also, the cleans are one of my favorite aspects of Genesi[s], but the lyrics are kinda dumb.
p5988
aVOlder Metalcore (e.g. Killswitch Engage, AILD, Unearth) just doesn't click with me. It doesn't grab my attention whatsoever. 
p5989
aVOld melodic metalcore like the stuff you listed or are you including all older metalcore so stuff like Converge and The Dillinger, Coalesce etc
p5990
aVBoth, really (though I can fuck with TDEP). I can't exactly explain it. I have given it a try, but I'm just not the biggest fan. I'll probably just re-visit some of it in a while and see if my reaction is different.  
p5991
aVFair enough dude, horses for courses.
p5992
aVI honestly thought I was alone with this. AILD just doesn't appeal to me at all, I don't know how they're as popular as they are.
p5993
aVI understand why they're popular (what with initially popularizing the genre and all), but they're just not for me. 
p5994
aVEh those were the bands that got me into this genre so they'll always have room in my heart. But yea they pretty much got boring for me eventually.
p5995
aVArchitects aren't anything special, and are way over hyped as one of the best in the genre. 
p5996
aVI strongly agree, I think Hollow Crown was their peak and that was like a decade ago
p5997
aVAnd it was *decent* at most
p5998
aVTotally agreed, I think the music sounds lazy on their newer albums. I know they wanted to move away from the more technical sound of Ruin/Hollow Crown, but LF/LT is just way too chuggy for me. Any metalcore could have wrote LF/LT imo, but few at the time could have wrote Hollow Crown.
p5999
aVYep I agree so much on this, way overrated.
p6000
aVI respectfully disagree.\u000a
p6001
aVWell there's a lot of bands that name-drop them as a huge influence (Stray From The Path, Northlane, Counterparts, Structures...). And they kinda mixed Meshuggah and TDEP with a more accessible sound way before it was "cool". With that being said, you get my vote haha
p6002
aVMaybe because I've only heard a few architects songs but to me there was nothing like meshugga or TDEP in there
p6003
aVI could point you old songs when the band themselves said they were ripping off TDEP, just check the Nightmares EP or some songs from Ruin. Then Architects clearly started to have their own sound but [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEHQ9urSm9Y) you can hear clearly Meshuggah influence in the main riff.
p6004
aVI see your point, especially about the hype. I still think they somewhat stand out among their contemporaries though. There were and are better metalcore bands, but I can't really think of any from the same cultural context.
p6005
aVConstellations was August Burns Red's worst album.
p6006
aVall of their albums sounded pretty much the same to me
p6007
aVYeah same, I love August Burns Red but I most likely couldn't tell the difference between their CDs
p6008
aVI like that about them honestly. Consistency.
p6009
aVWhat do you think their best album is? 
p6010
aVMessengers
p6011
aVAnyone else hear /u/DeadBlessings crying in the distance?
p6012
aVConstellations is sort of in the middle for me, not the best but not the worst
p6013
aVI loved restoring force. There. I said it. I LOVED it. It feels so good to get this off my chest. I know you may not approve but it is important that I am happy. I loved restoring force. 
p6014
aVI'm not judging, its your taste in music.
p6015
aVI can't get into Volumes.
p6016
aVMy one is, bands that people say were good back in the day weren't actually good like Of Mice And Men and Memphis may Fire\u000a\u000aAnd I also think a lot of Aussie popular metalcore bands are garbage, don't get me wrong they have some amazing stuff but a lot is pretty average its the same with most countries just I always here about how Australia is the place with some of the best metalcore, well at least to me it isn't. For a great Australian band listen to Idylls or Jack the Stripper. I also enjoy Northlane a bit
p6017
aVYou should've made separate comments for this, because I agree with the first half but not the second.
p6018
aVI think lots will be like that haha
p6019
aVI don't think, people say aussies have the best metalcore, I think it's deathcore. I could be wrong though.
p6020
aVThey've got Parkway Drive, Northlane, I Killed the Prom Queen, In Hearts Wake, The Amity Affliction, Dream On Dreamer, Feed Her to the Sharks and probably a few more I can't remember. So, yeah, the Aussie's are pretty prominent right now in Metalcore.
p6021
aVHellions, Hand of Mercy, Trophy Eyes
p6022
aVI was sticking to Metalcore, but those are some legit bands. Specifically Trophy Eyes, IMO. They were absolutely brilliant when I saw them live. 
p6023
aVOh yeah I guess those bands are more just hardcore then metalcore. And I can't wait to see Trophy Eyes on Warped this year, so jealous you've got to see them already.
p6024
aVYou're in for a treat, man. John has so much energy in his performance, he's a fucking joy to watch. 
p6025
aVAh man June 29 can't come quick enough.
p6026
aVI could only think of parkway drive and IKTPQ off the top of my head. I wasn't saying Aussie metalcore was bad 
p6027
aVI didn't think you were anyway so no worries, man. There was an influx of (pretty good imo) Australian bands in the last few years, so if you haven't been keeping up to date, you wouldn't know.  
p6028
aVbut all of those bands suck (northlane has potential i guess, but really doesnt go anywhere with it)
p6029
aVaussies do have the best deathcore\u000a\u000aalso cananda, but only because of subgroove
p6030
aVtfw I used to go to shows with the guy that owns subgroove
p6031
aVParkway Drive, capture the crown (or is it crown the empire)  just I see people here saying Aussi has solid as metalcore and release heaps of solid stuff.
p6032
aVCompletey disagree on the first part, especially with Memphis May Fire. But kind of agree with Aussie metalcore bands, yeah there's Northlane and PWD, but the majority is so mediocre. They have great deathcore and death metal bands thou.
p6033
aVI don't like PWD haha sorry mate. What is death melta? And deathcore I'd generally pass on
p6034
aV&gt;My one is, bands that people say were good back in the day weren't actually good like Of Mice And Men and Memphis may Fire\u000a\u000aso much this (cant upvote)
p6035
aVIt is painful not to upvote with what you agree but you must restrain haha 
p6036
aVGood shit with the title, really worked. 
p6037
aVNot sure if you are joking or being serious.
p6038
aVSerious, unpopular opinion threads are usually the typical circle-jerks, but following this rule really gets the point across.  
p6039
aVThat's what I was trying to do and I think it worked, as normally people have views that they all think is wrong but we find out it is the popular opinion. 
p6040
aVCan't upvote this enough!
p6041
aVThanks? Haha
p6042
aVI thought The Flood was a step down from OM&amp;M's s/t.\u000a\u000aMemphis May Fire are awful, except for the cleans. \u000a\u000aAn Ocean Between Us is AILD's second weakest album, their best is Awakened with The Powerless Rise as a close second. \u000a\u000aCount Your Blessings is BMTH's weakest album.\u000a\u000aAustin Carlile's vocals are grating and obnoxious. \u000a\u000aAsking Alexandria aren't as awful as some people make them out to be, as far as genericore goes they're actually pretty good. \u000a\u000aThis War is Ours &gt; Dying is Your Latest Fashion\u000a\u000aKezia is Protest the Hero's weakest album. \u000a\u000aWhiny cleans are awesome. \u000a\u000aLost Forever// Lost Together was just decent. Not even close to AOTY material.\u000a\u000aI can't take this genre's lyrics seriously most of the time. \u000a\u000aPlease don't kill me.
p6043
aVYou have a lot of stuff I agree with, and a lot of stuff I disagree with.  I really can't decide to upvote or not and it's hurting my head
p6044
aVSorry. 
p6045
aVIt's ok, I can't stay mad at you
p6046
aVDude...make separate comments for these lol. I agree and disagree with a lot. 
p6047
aV1. both were evenly awful\u000a1. eh, his cleans arent that great\u000a1. disagree\u000a1. all of them were weak\u000a1. so much yes\u000a1. disagree with all of my heart\u000a1. both sucked\u000a1. disagree\u000a1. disagree\u000a1. agree\u000a1. agree
p6048
aV&gt; both sucked\u000a\u000aexcept DIYLF is one of the best post-hardcore albums
p6049
aVthis, TWIO saw the loss of more phc elements for radio rock/generic hooks, not to mention Monte never shredded the way he did in early ETF once Craig joined, nor could he write songs like Ronnie could then.\u000a\u000aThe musicianship on almost all of etfs stuff post-DIYLF is pretty boring, save for stuff like the Guillotines and the occasional solos to say "hey, remember we've got one of the best guitarists in the genre, but don't worry we're not even gonna get close to using him to his full potential so that he leaves the band." \u000a\u000aI mean shit I think Fashionably Late was legitimately one of the worst failed experiments in history, but at least Jacky Vincent got to shred on most of the album.
p6050
aVI think part of why I don't get DIYLF is because I don't really listen to post hardcore, so I'm not entirely sure what mindset to listen from.\u000a\u000aThe only song I'm really into on it is Situations. While there are some tracks I really like on TWIO like Ten Miles Wide, and The Flood. 
p6051
aVThat album is garbage haha if you want good emotional post hardcore album go La Dispute 
p6052
aVIs EtF supposed to have a mostly emotional appeal? \u000a\u000a
p6053
aVNo its a catchy scene post hardcore / pop punk  that appeals to teenage girls 
p6054
aVAh, I assumed since you mentioned emotional post hardcore. 
p6055
aVNo just for me, I listen to post hardcore for emotional music or some mathcore stuff. As you mentioned you don't know how to feel when listening to post hardcore, there are a few aggressive tracks but on the whole its a lot more emotional (well the stuff I like) or more fun/light hearted than normal hardcore 
p6056
aVAh. If emotion is the main appeal of a lot of post hardcore, it might not be a genre for me. \u000a\u000aOf the post hardcore I've listened to, I think From First to Last, Dance Gavin Dance, and Drive Like Jehu are the ones I really liked. Unless you consider [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWweM9eaxg4) post hardcore. Because that's amazing. 
p6057
aVWell some stuff is emotion other stiff is fun like DGD there's quite a lot like that.\u000a\u000aIt could be post hardcore, it was really good but I couldn't handle the vocals haha too high pitched maybe but the music was great, the bass haha
p6058
aV&gt; Well some stuff is emotion other stiff is fun like DGD there's quite a lot like that.\u000a\u000aI could definitely get into stuff like DGD and Senses Fail. Or the crazier stuff like Drive Like Jehu. [Here Come the Rome Plows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3JEkDShKoc) is great. \u000a\u000a&gt;It could be post hardcore, it was really good but I couldn't handle the vocals haha too high pitched maybe but the music was great, the bass haha\u000a\u000aThe vocals can really get grating, but the bass is nuts with them. It's actually the main instrument. 
p6059
aVDude you like post hardcore more than me haha I like maybe 8-10 bands in the genre, Drive Like Jehu are great they remind me so much of die die die.\u000a\u000aThe bass was slapped aye? It was so good but the vocals :/
p6060
aV&gt;Dude you like post hardcore more than me haha I like maybe 8-10 bands in the genre,\u000a\u000aThat's about as many as I know myself. \u000a
p6061
aV&gt; that appeals to teenage girls\u000a\u000a\u005c&gt;recommends la dispute
p6062
aVAt least they don't portray an image.\u000a\u000aI know fair well LD has a fuck load of teeenage girl fans who reblog those stupid lyric pictures religiously but they also have an older fan base who see their music as creative and different.
p6063
aVevery band portrays an image, la dispute included. what type of image is what you'd have to get into.\u000a\u000a&gt;but they also have an older fan base who see their music as creative and different.\u000a\u000aso do fans of the original ETF.\u000a\u000aehhh @ calling la dispute creative and different though.
p6064
aVLa Dispute's image is one of looking nerdy/arty when I saw them live I was shocked at how much they looked like casual stoners haha\u000a\u000aOkay I wasn't into post hardcore back then, maybe I'm being harsh on them because of what I've heard from FIR and it was garbage at least in my opinion. My first introduction to ETF was in 2011/10 and it was two teenage girls who were just obsessed about Ronnie and his voice only.
p6065
aVMonte went off on The Guillotine pt. 2
p6066
aV&gt; save for stuff like the Guillotines and the occasional solo\u000a\u000ahelps to read it all, but yeah he did in all 3 haha. Good series of songs. I still find it funny that it was originally about Halo though lol 
p6067
aVOuch, I feel rather dumb
p6068
aVmaybe by the standards of a ptv fan ^^love ^^you
p6069
aVLol
p6070
aVLf/lt was average as in my opinion, very overrated in my opinion.\u000a\u000aThe rest I agree in except the whinny cleans and the asking Alexandria thing haha
p6071
aV1. Yes\u000a\u000a2. I think Matty's screams are fine\u000a\u000a3. Meh, they're all good\u000a\u000a4. 100x yes\u000a\u000a5. Thank fuck somebody said it.\u000a\u000a6. Definitely\u000a\u000a7. What the fuck did you say\u000a\u000a8. You were doing so good\u000a\u000a9. That's better\u000a\u000a10. Them are fightin' words bub\u000a\u000a11. I'll say 60/40 sure\u000a\u000a8-3, no upvote. Good job.\u000a
p6072
aVI think the order here is a little messed up. \u000a\u000a
p6073
aVFuck, just 2 and 3.
p6074
aVI don't remember what his screams sound like for #2, so I guess they can't be awful. \u000a\u000aAnd yes. All of AILD's albums are great. Even An Ocean Between Us. It just has too much filler for me, and a bit too much focus on the chugs. I like the inclusion of the thrash influence. I think [Without Conclusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oalcsmxOfho) from The Powerless Rise does that way better though.  And the inclusion of Josh Gilbert. 
p6075
aVYeah, usually a bands' highest charting album isn't the hardcore fans' favorite album. Key word: *usually*.
p6076
aVI thought An Ocean Between Us was the fan favorite. 
p6077
aVAhh, maybe it is. I can't say I've followed the AILD fanbase too much. My two favorites are Shadows are Security and Awakened, it's pretty much a toss up.
p6078
aV1. They were on par for me\u000a\u000a2. All of his vocals are over-produced, so it's whatever\u000a\u000a3. I don't like AILD. Fight me :3\u000a\u000a4. Yes\u000a\u000a5. Yes\u000a\u000a6. Stand Up &amp; Scream is decent genericore, everything else sucks\u000a\u000a7. I prefer Craig to Ronnie so, yeah\u000a\u000a8. I'm indifferent\u000a\u000a9. They have the *potential* to be awesome, and some can pull it off\u000a\u000a10. FUCK YOU\u000a\u000a11. I stopped doing that a while ago\u000a\u000aIt's about a 50/50 split, so I'll just leave your karma alone. 
p6079
aVI think Emmure are great and they deserve less hate.
p6080
aVGoodbye to the Gallows is a great album.
p6081
aVI like the idea of this, I'll start\u000a\u000alyrics based on politics and religion (christian or athiest) are both fucking stupid
p6082
aVupvoted4christ
p6083
aVI'm just gonna say this is ironic considering everything here is a subgenre of punk, which is known for its political lyrics.
p6084
aVI'm fine with both just as long as they don't go to the extreme. Christian lyrics are fine just as long as it's not puritanical horse shit like Reformers, and atheist lyrics are fine just as long as it's not wanna be edgy shit (DAE fuk ur faith?)\u000a\u000aSame notion applies to political lyrics too. Political lyrics that aren't too self-righteous and condescending CAN be thought-provoking or interesting, but if you're using music as a means to propagate or indoctrinate others, then fuck off. Edgy political lyrics are pretty cringy too (DAE da guverment suking dikks of corporations?\u000aDAE u had it all, U FUKIN PIGZ?)
p6085
aVCan't upvote. I love Enter Shikari's style, but the only song I can listen to by them  is Constellations. 
p6086
aVI want to upvote you as I agree but I must restrain myself haha though I think lots of people will disagree\u000a\u000aThanks for thinking its a good idea!
p6087
aVI don't necessarily think it's stupid, I just really don't care what the lyrical content is as long as it doesn't stand out as terrible. A lot of people put so much focus into lyrics and their true deep meaning, when I couldn't give less of a fuck. Attila is one of my favorite Metalcore bands just for how damn stupid their lyrics are, and they really don't bother with deep meanings and meaningful lyrics, which I think is a good kind of rip on the genre.
p6088
aVCan I ask why you dislike these kinds of lyrics? Most of the time I put it down to the fact that people just don't care or don't want to know about all the horrible stuff that's going on.
p6089
aV95% of it isnt true, the government isnt tyrannical and yelling about it wouldn't change anything had it been. Yeah, sure theres some corruption, but its not nearly as bad as people like to make it out to be. 
p6090
aVDjent and Chugging are not synonymous (northlane and volumes)
p6091
aVblessthefall was better off with Craig.\u000aOn the other hand Craig should seriously leave ETF and focus on TDR.
p6092
aVI really disagree with your first point, btf have only become better IMO. I agree with your second point though. While I enjoy newer ETF, TDR has way more potential. Craig's screams are awesome.
p6093
aVI think most bands that get voted for the band of the month aren't that good and I really don't know how certain ones have gotten on there at all, especially before most bands that have actually helped shaped the genre
p6094
aVI actually agree with this so much.
p6095
aVThere are bands that are obviously bullshit in metalcore, but I genuinely think most of the music here that people here dig  (Beartooth, TAA, Sirens and Sailors, BTF, INK, ERRA, WCAR, etc.) is all breakdowns and bullshit. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of those bands and respect their talent as songwriters and musicians, but I don't classify most of this genre as real music anymore.\u000a\u000aDon't mean to come across as pretentious because these bands are capable of dynamics and songwriting greater than anything my band will ever come close to accomplishing, but I still think it's bullshit music. Kinda like how I'm never going to feel any emotional connection to the latest and greatest radiorock-core band or pop rock band.\u000a\u000aThat being said, there are some bands that I absolutely love and respect in this genre as well.
p6096
aVI don't think Erra deserves to be on that list. Sure they have their fair bit of chugs but their song writing is some of the most innovative in the genre. I don't know how you can't classify them as music. \u000a\u000aAs a side note, this inverted upvote/downvote thing is a bit of a mess. Cool idea, but aside from the main comments, I can't tell whether replies are being upvoted or downvoted. Also, are people downvoting things they agree with? lol
p6097
aVI think it's funny that you highlighted ERRA out of all the bands I mentioned. I've tried getting into them a few times, but they're the only band on here that I haven't spent a significant amount of time listening to. Maybe I'll have to give them another chance.\u000a\u000aAlso, I still respect the shit out of these bands and think they're good music. It would be incredibly pretentious of me to try and claim that they're not. The whole "real music" argument is definitely a bullshit argument and basically boils down to opinion, but I hope everyone understands what I'm trying to get at when I say it doesn't feel like "real music" to me. I remember back in the day when it felt authentic to me, but my taste has changed.
p6098
aVSo I just want to defend 3 of the bands you listed because idgaf about the others:\u000a\u000a[blessthefall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDDn4Kh65MA): Great guitar work and drumming, really no chugging breakdowns.\u000a\u000a[Ice Nine Kills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAdAOuJ1fzs): Again, really good guitar work, I like the vocals a lot too. And they're at least doing something different with the theme of the song and how it's set up, not really cookie cutter like most of their peers.\u000a\u000a[Erra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTPqWF4rt1E): I just kinda recently got into them, but if you don't like anything else, you have to appreciate their lyrics. They're surprisingly well-written and have a really large vocabulary. The vocals are really strong (even though the cleans are whiny at times), and they're heavy as fuck, but they do have a shit ton of breakdowns, they just do them well.
p6099
aVLike I said, I haven't listened to Erra that much, but I do love Ghost Atlas, their singer's side project. I haven't paid attention to their lyricism too much either since I haven't really dug through them. \u000a\u000aAgain, I love BTF and INK and I really enjoy the instrumentals, but I find it very hard to connect emotionally or get immersed with artists who's discography is full of chugging breakdowns, violent or absurdly angry lyrics, and that one soft song on every album. It's very fun and interesting to listen to and I will listen through an album like that 50+ times, but it's all bullshit to me haha. A couple years back, I really connected with bands like MMF, TAA, and WCAR, but my tastes have changed a lot since then. 
p6100
aVYeah, I can sort of agree with him to a point, but erra should not be on that list. I can't even rap my head around the idea of someone saying that erra isn't worthy of being "real music". They're all fantastic musicians even if there is a fair amount of mindless chugging in their music
p6101
aVOn a more serious note, new Of Mice and Men isn't any worse than old Of Mice and Men. Generic scenecore isn't any better than generic radio rock\u000a\u000aBVB, Sworn in, and FIR are more talented than most bands posted here\u000a\u000aBMTH has had scene fans from the very start. Suicide Season and Count Your Blessings are probably their most scene albums\u000a
p6102
aVI have to partially agree with you on FIR. I think overall the songs they make aren't that great, but they were the last band of the day that played at Warped and damn those guitar solos were incredible. 
p6103
aVPeople love to talk shit on bands like FIR or BVB but if you actually take the time to listen to them, they actually sometimes have a fair amount of musical talent. Jackie Vincent is a fantastic guitar player. 
p6104
aVTotally agree with you. You couldn't pay me to listen to FIR in my free time, but there's no denying that FIR do have talent
p6105
aVI agree with all this, and I feel BMTH went from scene fans to Tumblr fans.\u000a\u000aOh I don't agree about FIR etc man I hate those bands.
p6106
aVHaha I dont like those bands either ( Sworn In is okay though,) I'm just saying they're more talented than stuff like ADTR, or MMF (both old and new)
p6107
aVtumblr = the new myspace fr
p6108
aVI see where you are going at but there are plenty of bands here that are more talented like Converge, ETID etc
p6109
aVI love all those bands, but they don't get posted nearly as often as stuff like TDWP, Beartooth, old MMF, TAA etc. Obviously there are gonna be bands like PtH, BTBAM, Converge etc. that are ridiculously more talented than BVB and FIR
p6110
aVIts just most people here don't really like that style of metalcore :/
p6111
aV[deleted]
p6112
aV[deleted]
p6113
aVWoah hey, BVB/FIR &gt; ADTR? What...?
p6114
aVIn terms of both songwriting and technical skill, yes. Maybe ADTR are more talented than they show in their songs, but their music is extremely cookie cutter and simple.\u000a\u000aEdit: I think all three bands have their fair share of cringy lyrics, but I still think overall BVB are better lyricists than ADTR
p6115
aVI would say generic scenecore is more enjoyable/entertaining than radio rock (in general), especially from a musician's perspective. Would you rather listen to Of Mice &amp; Men/Asking Alexandria/BMTH etc on repeat or something like Theory of a Dead Man/Nickelback/Three Days Grace?
p6116
aVThey're both equally bad imo. If we're talking about this from a musician's perspective, there's nothing a genericore guitarist could do that a radio rock guitarist couldn't do
p6117
aVGuitarist, maybe (I've played for 4 years and there's some generic scene core I have trouble playing fast enough for) but drums surely not. I've played the drums for 11 years, and it takes 10x more skill to play any scenecore/hardcore in general drums than any rock song ever, between double bass, off beats, mathcore shit and blast beats, etc etc. That's actually why I even got into core in the first place, cause I like to play along to what I listen to, and I was entirely bored with mainstream/rock music outside of stuff like A7X, Breaking Benjamin, ATR, etc. so I searched for something more stimulating. I've gotten into several arguments with guitarists about the complexity of songs, all unable to see things from a drummer's perspective lol. Even non-musicians who just don't get it.
p6118
aVI'm a self taught drummer and I play guitar (both for about 4 years) and the majority of genericore is easy on both. You said scenecore/hardcore, but you can't really lump them both together. The hardest thing about genicore like Asking Alexandria or Of Mice and Men on drums is just getting the coordination to play the kick patterns, which anyone can get down with a year of practice. I've never heard blast beats or complicated time signatures in a genericore song in my life. This is why you can't lump scenecore and hardcore together; actual hardcore is chock-full of fast blast beats, complicated kick patterns, and unorthodox time signatures. Scenecore has none of this on drums.\u000a\u000aEven if we're talking about guitar, stuff like A7X and Breaking Benjamin is ridiculously more stimulating than genericore, which basically consists of chugging an open chord, maybe playing an alternate picking riff, then going into a chorus which only consists of four powerchords. A7X has plenty of tricky leads and solos that the average genicore guitarist probably can't play\u000a\u000aI think we're on the same page for the most part, but your definition of generic scenecore seems to be a bit different
p6119
aVI think you misunderstood, A7X and Breaking Benjamin were my examples of non generic mainstream music I still listened to when j got into hardcore music, which 'scenecore' is a subgenre of. \u000a\u000aI don't know of you've ever listened Miss May I's early stuff, but its pretty stereotypical scenecore and has plenty of both math beats and blast beats. Most scenecore has off beats actually, Of Mice &amp; Men's first album has a lot of it. Scenecore is very erratic musically in order to sound more complex than it really is. \u000a\u000aI could already play any A7X song when I got into core and I was still blown away by stuff that generic metalcore drummers could do. Regardless of talent or innovation, that extra year you mentioned developing the skill it takes to do even basic scenecore double bass is longer than it would take to learn some generic butt rock song for even a beginner. 
p6120
aVMy bad, I did misunderstand what you said about A7X and Breaking Benjamin. Not sure if I would call metalcore a subgenre of hardcore, more of just a crossover of metal and hardcore punk. But at this point I'm probably just splitting hairs haha\u000a\u000aI've never listened to MMI barring a few songs, so I've never really heard generic metalcore with anything too complicated on drums\u000a\u000aBut if we're talking about guitar, my point still stands: Anyone with a year of experience can chug an open chord and then play some powerchords\u000a\u000a
p6121
aVOM&amp;M were never really that good.
p6122
aVThe fact that Crown the Empire get a decent amount of hate yet The Amity Affliction and Beartooth are praised to no end is, shall we say.....Disgusting. ^^^I'm ^^^sorry
p6123
aVI completely agree. I've never understood how CtE can get knocked for being generic but yet Amity and Beartooth are praised to no end. I like all three of these bands, but there all cut from pretty much the same cloth if you ask me.
p6124
aVCrown the empire's vocalist (guy who screams) is one of the most talented I've ever seen. And I don't even listen to them. 
p6125
aVI thought opinion was pretty split on Beartooth. Like quite a bit of the sub thought Disgusting was lacklustre as shit (such as myself). 
p6126
aVProbably more split than TAA, but CtE get way more hate than they deserve if we're gonna sit here and jerk the other bands. I like TAA too, I just think people are overpraising them. I'll never understand Beartooth though.
p6127
aVI'm entirely guilty for over-praising TAA, if I'm honest. See, I wasn't a fan of CtE's latest album, so I'm pretty much the epitome of what you dislike in this sub. Nice to meet ya.
p6128
aVHaha, see the difference is, you don't shove it down peoples' throats that you like TAA a lot (or that you think they're so much better than all of the other bands). You also contribute a lot of content to this sub and /r/poppunkers (don't see you in /r/posthardcore that much) so in reality, you are the epitome of everything that is *right* with these subs. 
p6129
aVNot as big-up in my ph-c but I like quite a bit of it. Love you too, man :*
p6130
aVIt took me a little bit for metalcore as well. What type of phc do you like? Risecore, Blue Swan-core, classic phc, mid-2000's phc, I the Mighty/Hands Like Houses-core, Electronicore, etc.
p6131
aVThe fact that I can't completely distinguish between those categories kinda says something about my experience with it. My favorite phc bands are Enter Shikari, letlive, A Lot Like Birds and later Brand New. 
p6132
aVI'll try and categorize them for you: \u000a\u000a\u000a**Risecore**: (doesn't have to be on Rise) Sleeping With Sirens, A Skylit Drive, Jamie's Elsewhere (new), I Am King, Youth in Revolt, Whether I, Myka Relocate, Secrets, Alive Like Me, and a bunch that's metalcore. \u000a\u000a\u000a**The Wave**: Touche Amore, La Dispute, Pianos Become the Teeth, Balance &amp; Composure, Tiny Moving Parts, Defeater (Melodic Hardcore), Make Do and Mend, Polar Bear Club (Pre-Death Chorus), Mewithoutyou etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Classic**: Fugazi, Blood Brothers, Drive Like Jehu, At The Drive In, Thrice, Thursday, Glassjaw, He is Legend, Fall of Troy, Foxy Shazam, early Coheed, The Recieving End of Sirens, Fear Before The March of Flames, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Mid 2000's**: Alexisonfire, Senses Fail, Alesana, Silverstein, Armor For Sleep, ATNWT-era ADTR, Anthony Green-era Saosin, Ronnie-era Escape The Fate, Aiden?, MCR (first album), The Used (First two albums), Funeral For A Friend, Ice Nine Kills (Early), Chiodos, Pierce The Veil, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Electronicore**: Enter Shikari, Aaron Pauley-era Jamies Elsewhere, Hands Like Houses' first album was pretty close, not too many others I can think of.\u000a\u000a\u000a**???-core**: Saosin (Cove), Emarosa, Hands Like Houses, I The Mighty, Conditions, Life on Repeat, Slaves, Hearts &amp; Hands, The Alchemy Index, Too Close To Touch, Gates, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Swan-core**: Dance Gavin Dance, A Lot Like Birds, Sianvar, Secret Band, Hail The Sun, Stolas, Adventurer, Juneva, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Theatrical**: I Am Ghost, Set It Off, Get Scared, SycAmour, The Funeral Portait, Vampires Everywhere, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Other**: Brand New, Letlive, The Venetia Fair, Circa Survive, Falling In Reverse, Isles &amp; Glaciers, D.R.U.G.S, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000aThere ya go. I probably forgot a bunch and some are probably wrong and/or debatable, but it's just a very basic categorization to help you.
p6133
aVI can safely say that I listen to at least one band from each of these categories. Well, this will come in useful for my adventures further into phc. Thanks!
p6134
aVWould mewithoutYou fit under "the wave?"
p6135
aVThat was quite funny, I just dislike them all haha
p6136
aVI don't think TAA is that bad, in fact, they're ok, but people around here act like they're gods. Don't even get me started on Beartooth though....
p6137
aVIt makes you sick aye hahahaha sorry for that 
p6138
aVI like Beartooth
p6139
aVI'm on the opposite end of this cos' I don't really understand why there's so much hate for TAA &amp; Beartooth. I love all 3 bands equally.\u000a\u000a

aVI actually agree, I really like ABR, but Parkway just isn't really my thing
p6148
aVDon't get into them...
p6149
aVPretty much all the music we love is for kids. Since the beginning of the genre. It's all for kids. I'm definitely on the older side of the people on here but it's true.
p6150
aVWell what music is for adults? That is aggressive.
p6151
aVI would say a lot more regular hardcore. Metalcore's subject matter just seems to be more directed for the kids these days. Definitely Not all, but most.
p6152
aVAre we including Converge to be a kids band and other mathcore?
p6153
aVI would say they are a little more mature. I personally wouldn't put them in the "kids" category
p6154
aVI'm just checking if the metalcore I like is kids music haha 
p6155
aVhaha well thats the thing though. I said "we love". I'm in the same boat on a bunch of the stuff i love too. Its not a terrible thing, its just the way i see it. 
p6156
aVI'd still be under the age of kid I guess just I think a fair bit of metallic hardcore / mathcore would be listened by not only kids, a large majority would be but just not as much as the popular bands here.
p6157
aVI'd like to respectfully disagree. While a lot of metalcore does seem to appeal mainly to angsty teens, a lot of it does not. I am currently listening to Silent Planet. I do not see how their music is specifically "for kids" in any way. Anyways *upvoted* haha
p6158
aVHaha well with them I'll always see them as kids because I helped A2 and sat in on them recording their first EP. They were so young! Very cool guys though and definitely have talent.
p6159
aVNot sure I agree about it being like it since the beginning. I can't imagine many young teens were spin-kicking and stagediving to bands like Hatebreed or Earth Crisis back in the early-90s. I do agree with what it is now, metalcore bands know their target demographic and that's fair enough, makes going to shows kinda frustrating though.
p6160
aVRestoring Force is Of Mice and Men's best album
p6161
aVPopularization of metalcore is not a bad thing
p6162
aVBeartooth fucking sucks.
p6163
aVBring Me The Horizon's best song is Drown\u000a\u000aAsking Alexandria's best album is From Death To Destiny\u000a\u000aDanny Worsnop will be much better off in We Are Harlot\u000a\u000aRonnie Radke can choke on a dick and die, you're all invited to the party I will be throwing\u000a\u000aOf Mice and Men's best album is Restoring Force\u000a\u000aFor reference I'm 24 years old and feel like these bands are growing up with me, not staying 16 and playing countless pointless breakdowns. 
p6164
aVWhen's the party?\u000a\u000aBMTH 's best work was septerminal in my opinion, have you thought about trying other bands in the genre who don't revolve around chugs and breakdowns, such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch and other mathcore stuff also converge haha 
p6165
aVHonestly, I've never been able to get into Dillinger or Converge. Never heard Botch though
p6166
aVHmm I'd say you wouldn't like them then. What about Every time I die? 
p6167
aVAlways fun to see live!
p6168
aVNot sure how to vote on this... I agree with some but not all of them...
p6169
aVHaha I upvoted because I disagree with them all :) Well played.
p6170
aVBlack Veil Brides' newest album &gt; Asking Alexandria's newest album
p6171
aVI'd pass on both
p6172
aVAnything Black Veil Brides has put out &gt; anything Asking Alexandria has put out\u000a\u000aBetter overall musicianship, and they know how to write lyrics that aren't only about sluts and getting fucked
p6173
aVthis actually
p6174
aVI think August Burns Red, while good, are so god damn lack luster, they seem like the band that everyone bases metal core off of. Maybe that's a good thing, but it holds them back for me. 
p6175
aVAll their stuff sounds so similar, they have some good stuff but then it all sounds alike to me.
p6176
aVThe Truth of a Liar is the only good song by them to me, and ironically enough it's a really damn good song, it's up there in my "favorite song" list. 
p6177
aVI can't think of any band where I only like one song from the artist.
p6178
aVHaha ABR is my take. 
p6179
aVRestoring Force was pretty good and the only album of mice and men has put out that I like.
p6180
aV[deleted]
p6181
aVI really don't like the new stuff by Of Mice and Men but I think this subreddit is being super bitchy about it and not letting it go. I don't think Austin Carlile is a bad guy at all. He's changing his band towards a new direction that he wants to go and they all seem to be going with him on it. Plus his whole saving lives thing isn't negative any way you look at it if people don't like it then whatever they call him corny,if it actually saves a life that's good I'd rather come off super corny and fake then have people commiting suicide.
p6182
aVI agree its better that they send a positive than a negative message.
p6183

aVSame here bro can't wait! \u000a\u000aFor ETID their set closing song of choice always seems to be Moor so give that a listen as it's both easy to learn the lyrics to and a lot of people are gonna be yelling that. Exometrium is also a killer song and they'll be playing that. Honorable mentions also include: The Great Secret, Decayin' With The Boys, Thirst (they'll probably open with this) and Underwater Bimbos From Outer Space is sick too!\u000a\u000aAlso give The Disconnect a listen to, it's by the opening band Counterparts and they're such an outstanding band but I fear they're gonna get little to no love from the crowd as they're not exactly metalcore or very well known but yeah the final lines of The Disconnect are brilliant and you need to learn them to shout out to the band and give 'em some love, Ghost is a great song and so is Outlier if you're willing to give a little more attention to them, they have great stage presence and I would happily pay to go to a show with them headlining.\u000a\u000aI'm not familiar with Blessthefall so I can't help there!\u000a\u000aHope this helps, see you there man!
p6226
aVI checked out ETID and Counterparts. I can hear the punkier side of metalcore in ETID, it's interesting, but not really my thing. Counterparts on the other hand, holy shit I love this.

aVAlso Dan is the drummer mate, I know they look identical but it's gonna be hard for Dan to tune his guitar sat behind a drum kit!

aVLOL I always get them mixed up. I know Tom is the one that writes it so he's the guitarist... Duh. I'll edit it.
p6230
aVThese dudes are elevating metalcore to another fucking level. More bands should strive to be like Architects. 
p6231
aVI was already hyped because i'm going to see them live for the fifth time next saturday. This video gave me even more hype. Holy shit.
p6232
aVKills it? Sure he sounds great live but he skips *sooo* many words.
p6233
aVBut then try screaming for an hour, it's not easy even with experience.
p6234
aVHe isn't skipping the words, he is holding the mic to the crowd, it just isn't picked up in the video I think
p6235
aVSometimes he's holding his mic out to the crowd, but I think there's a few points where he just can't finish the whole line and stops.
p6236
aVI agree with you. I love this band but nothing is more anti-climactic than when the singer comes to the best parts of that particular line and then it just goes silent... I know all about how hard/tiring it is but you go to hear the singer not the crowd. 
p6237
aVYeah, you're probably right lol I posted this after hearing the first 2 songs and then I watched the rest. Still a great performance though.
p6238
aVHoly fucking shit the way Sam handles the last lines in These Colours was fucking mind-blowing, I've been to about 4 Architects shows and have never seen him do lows that well and for that length... Incredible band.

p6257
aVIt's hard for me to get into this album bc I feel like the production was bad on it, like the mix is off and makes the instruments sound too quiet... Is it only me?

aVIt still upsets me how they aren't as popular as they should be 
p6259
aVYou and me both. I'm so excited for a new album, and I'm going to see them on this tour. I drove 8 hours to see them just before Wolves Within came out, hopefully we can get the album before the tour this time, but I doubt it

aVThey don't really play it much anymore though
p6284
aVWhat a shame. I love their new stuff, but that song is just fucking solid for moshing and going crazy.
p6285
aVI just can't get into the first album at all for some reason
p6286
aVI'm a big fan of Mabbitt's work, so I can still play it, but some songs haven't aged well. He was really young when it came out and his vocals tend to go towards the whiny side. Whereas with Beau, he just has higher vocals.
p6287
aVI just don't like Mabbitt that much I think

p6295
aVI've seen ETID 26 times (I live in buffalo) and the play floater at every show, and I swear to god, it gets harder and harder every time. You can tell that they just genuinely love playing it
p6296
aVThat's amazing, about the song and the fact you've seen 26 times, haven't seen them once.i'm going to watch live videos haha
p6297
aVThey play a bunch of older stuff, even The Logic Of Crocodiles from their first record.
p6298
aVOh that's awesome, I love Hot Damn, have you ever heard them play any thing from the burial plot bidding war?
p6299
aVIn person, no.  But I know that they used to play Home Is Where You Hang Yourself quite a bit.  There are probably videos of it.
p6300
aVI've seen some of those from hellfest 2001 (I think) just that ep is so different to their other stuff.
p6301
aVFor sure, they definitely have come full circle since then.
p6302

p6326
aV&gt; pursue some more music\u000a\u000aSadly, they're some promising bands that are posted here and doesn't get upvoted at all or barely but every [PWD, ABR, TDWP...] song posted here gets upvoted thru the roof. Try and listen to those unknown band names often.
p6327
aVMy biggest problem with a lot of bands is the whiny singing. I love Northlane, ABR, PWD, and Zombie EP screaming. Sounds rough but not gurgling if you know what I mean. 
p6328
aVI cannot wait to see these dudes Saturday.  I was originally going for ABR and Erra but holy crap am I pumped after checking them out.
p6329
aVI'm surprised that there're still people on this sub that hadn't heard Northlane yet. They're are all over this sub.
p6330
aVI was one of them.  I saw their posts, I think the last one I paid attention to was a video of Dispossession and at the time I just didn't like it.  Then I check out their setlist and holy crap do I love everything off Singularity.  And Rot is just so orgasmic.  I read up on their story for searching for their current vocalist and I thought that was so damn cool.

aVKillswitch Engage, they pretty much started the formula that bands like OM&amp;M followed and they've been around since ~2000. \u000a\u000aAlso:\u000a\u000aProtest the Hero\u000a\u000aBetween the Buried and Me\u000a\u000aParkway Drive\u000a\u000aConverge\u000a\u000aEvery Time I Die\u000a\u000aHeaven  Shall Burn (arguably melodic death metal, but their earlier stuff like Antigone and Iconoclast was metalcore. and Veto had a strong metalcore edge)\u000a\u000aMisery Signals (these guys are hit or miss for me, but they're probably the most "mature" band I know of in the genre, and if you don't mind chugging they won't be so hit or miss)\u000a\u000aRingworm\u000a\u000a
p6337
aVAll great bands, but definitely check out Heaven Shall Burn, OP.
p6338
aVI'm admittedly not that familiar with them myself (I really need to be). But Valhalla is an amazing song. And their cover of Black Tears is better than the original imo.
p6339
aV[deleted]
p6340
aV&gt;! I didn't even know Black Tears was a cover til I youtubed it one day\u000a\u000aI didn't either, until I listened to Eternal Tears of Sorrow and heard the song come on.

p6343
aVOP asked for recommendations of people's favorite bands, I recommended my favorite band, especially because they don't seem like they would go down the radio rock route
p6344
aVThey won't go down the radio rock route because they're making the same record over and over again.
p6345
aVWhile they've kept a fairly similar overall style, they've put in a lot more experimental/progressive elements into the newer albums, which at least for me keeps them sounding fresh and interesting, apparently not for you though. Compare [Composure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nl_ttX031Y) to [Beauty in Tragedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-noYJ459dE), I think they've changed quite a bit over time
p6346
aVI'm not saying it's a bad thing, I actually enjoyed Rescue and Restore wich is probably their best album along with Constellations, but they are not exciting or fresh anymore at least for me. And PWD are going the same road.
p6347
aVFair enough, I've never been a huge PWD fan, so I haven't really payed much attention to them, from the little studio stuff they've posted so far though, it seems like the new ABR album this year is going to be really good, though who knows what you'll think of it, since I thought Rescue &amp; Restore was a great progression too, and kept me interested
p6348
aVAttila is probably the most mature band in the genre. 
p6349

p6350
aVThey made me the woman I am today.\u000a\u000aJust kidding, but it scares me some people out there have probably said this....I don't want to meet them....
p6351
aVAs I Lay Dying- While they are no more, every single song is a banger. Seriously, they are amazing. \u000a\u000aBreakdown of Sanity -  Because they are fucking amazing. Their album Perception was fantastic and I really hope they get a States tour. They re-released a new song "My heart in your hands" on Dec 31st, self produced and everything. They are so fucking good. \u000a\u000aTexas In July- Personally BloodWork (their most recent album 2014) was my album of the year and quite possibly my all time favorite album. They draw alot of similarities towards August Burns Red (I don't see how they do but everyone's opinion is different). BloodWork features their new single JT Cavey, all their older albums are their old front man, while good, I think JT fits the band better. \u000a\u000aA Breach of Silence -  Their newest album The Darkest Road was like 13 tracks of awesomeness. One of the few bands that I like with clean vocals. \u000a\u000aFeed Her To The Sharks -  Savage Seas is a fucking amazing album, new album releases in 3 days and it's already being streamed. It's awesome. \u000a\u000aWhiteChapel -  On the boarder of deathcore but their most recent album was fucking amazing. Specifically the song The Saw Is The Law. I believe Phil Bozeman(vocalist and one of the best in the business)  said they recorded that track in garage band just to prove it could be done. \u000a\u000aOld MMI -  Apologies are for the weak and Monument are 2 albums of straight fucking headbanging. Their newest albums are meh, but not terrible (can't stand Rise of the lion). \u000a\u000aThis Or The Apocalypse -  one of the few bands whose guitarists play riffs throughout the entire song, including breakdowns. The song Americans is fucking awesome. \u000a\u000aI could go on but I already wrote a novel, if you want more just let me know! \u000a\u000a
p6352
aV&gt; As I Lay Dying\u000a\u000aThey're guaranteed not to change their sound for the next 6 years or so!

aVI loved Sempiternal, don't get me wrong. But Drown is just weird
p6369
aVdrown had TONS of references to there is a hell/sempiternal and I think they was just closing the story arc that they had going.\u000a\u000ait showed their ability to change their sound and pull it off extremely well for a song too, they're an extremely versatile band.
p6370
aVSempiternal is not... nvm.
p6371
aVIt's Metalcore.
p6372
aVI hope this is a troll.\u000a\u000aEither way this comment gave me cancer.
p6373
aVyour comment gave me cancer so we're even\u000a\u000afor a band that everyone constantly copies, bring me the horizon's 3 metalcore albums are some of the best releases in the past ~7 years.
p6374
aVYeah but I thought we were talking about their new release? Are we not?
p6375
aVWhich one? They released two singles late last year, that doesn't mean that they'll be doing music like either song - they've even stated that they won't.
p6376
aVI was thinking drown, I wasn't calling them sellouts, I just strongly disagreed with what he said. I like BMTH but I don't like drown, but I'm happy they said they aren't changing their sound.
p6377
aVOh alright. But yeah I remember Sykes tweeting about how Drown was "just a song that they had to get out there before their next album and isn't indicative of the direction that they will be taking" and then "Dont Look Down" was a song that they did with Foreign Beggars for the Drive re-score where they said the same thing pretty much.
p6378
aVOh, well that's a relief, BMTH is one if the biggest names in metalcore and if they changed their sound that would be a huge disappointment. 
p6379
aVthey've always changed their sound on every album though, they don't stick to one sound like parkway drive or some other generic band though. i'm hoping for a heavier progressive of sempiternal tbh.
p6380
aVExactly, sempiternal is kind of an awkward album, it sort of rides the line between metalcore and post hardcore. I'd really like to see more metalcore from them again. 
p6381
aVit has a lot of post-rock and post-hardcore elements, but it doesn't really ride of the line between metalcore and post-hardcore imo. it's just metalcore with a lot of influence and elements from different genres.
p6382
aVI could see what you mean by that. Pretty good album nonetheless.
p6383
aVI don't see August Burns Red, or Parkway Drive changing thier sound any time soon, and they are the best in the metalcore scene. 
p6384
aVparkway drive no\u000a\u000aabr sure

(lp6449
VThe new fascination with "seriousness" is the newest fad, and it's honestly probably a reaction from the nearly cringeworthy era of 2000's metalcore. The best example I have for this has got to be The Devil Wears Prada. How on earth you could go from [this](http://imgur.com/pjZS1rD) to [this](http://imgur.com/SVECSSx)?\u000a\u000aHowever, I digress. All this is to say that, it's kind of hard to find bands that, well, look like they're having fun. I would check out [The Ongoing Concept](http://youtu.be/joYKnDbwUoI?t=1m14s) though, they have pretty upbeat, fun stuff.
p6450
aVWell you have to consider that the members in TDWP are growing up and maturing, it makes sense that it would have some effect on their music.
p6451
aVOh yeah, I have nothing against new TDWP, it was just the best example. I was gonna use Avenged Sevenfold, because wow, but they aren't really a part of the scene anymore.
p6452
aVOh boy could I rip a new one into A7X. When I heard Hail to the King, I just stopped. I couldn't. I'm all for bands trying new stuff, one of my favorite albums was their self-titled, but Hail to the King was just so...bleh.
p6453
aVDude I know. I listened to all of Waking the Fallen just earlier today, and I figured I'd give Hail to the King another try. I let out an audible laugh during the Italian chanting on one of those songs. It's just so...awkward. 
p6454
aVWell I mean shortly after WtF they said that all their favorite bands weren't nearly as extreme as they were, and then that's why City of Evil happened. And HttK was sort of like City of Evil pt 2, or like CoE with even more classic metal influence.
p6455
aVThat makes sense, they practically ripped that spoken word intro from one of those songs straight off of Bat Country, but it just doesn't do it for me on the new album. 
p6456
aVI feel you, there are some valid complaints about HttK, I still enjoy it however. 
p6457
aVI can respect that. I think it's one of their best selling albums so they gotta be doing something right. 
p6458
aVYeah. Although I am kind of yearning for something a little more complex, like CoE was. And the metalcore fan in me secretly hopes for something a little more like WtF, but there's no way that'll happen.
p6459
aVI feel you. I guess I'll just sit here and listen to Not Ready To Die over and over again, because that's about as close to metalcore as they'll get now. 
p6460
aVHonestly, just looks like they grew up. *shrugs*

p6464
aVFirst of all, welcome back! How long have you been out? If you like Attack Attack! then I would suggest Caleb Shomo's new band Beartooth. It has a much more mature feel to it, but it's still pretty brutal. One of my favorite bands that's pretty diverse and still going strong is A Day to Remember. Here are some other bands that I would recommend checking out, and my favorite song by them:\u000a\u000a- [The Amity Affliciton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu3xGr-lNVI)\u000a\u000a- [August Burns Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97T1Zo5-u-o) [Yes it's the full album, just experience it in its entirety]\u000a\u000a- [Beartooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=557mc5ICVv8)\u000a\u000a- [Born of Osiris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLdlw46Ru9I) [These guys are insane live, and they've become one of my favorite bands after seeing them live at Warped]\u000a\u000a- [Capture the Crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxkjfaV9k8Q) [Not a huge fan of their newer stuff, but their first album was pretty solid]\u000a\u000a- [For All Those Sleeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeU6tx1Nvgs)\u000a\u000a- [For Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_b0VweDx8) [Super heavy stuff. Really big fan of them. Great breakdowns and fantastic vocals]\u000a\u000a- [Ice Nine Kills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maguF26AIik)\u000a\u000a- [Like Moths to Flames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYRYVlgYMlk)\u000a\u000a- [The Plot In You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6Nodj6aDOI) [One of my all-time favorite bands. I don't see them mentioned a lot, but they are seriously worth a listen]\u000a\u000aI have a million other bands to throw at you, but I don't want to take up the entire comments and I don't want to keep others from suggesting their own bands. Let me know if you want more.
p6465
aVI knew that ABR album would be Constellations before opening it. Great choice.
p6466
aVIt's really my favorite album, but almost all of their albums need to be heard in one go for the first time. Yes, even the Christmas album.
p6467
aV&amp;gt; For Today\u000a\u000a&amp;gt; Super heavy stuff\u000a\u000awat
p6468
aVtheir breakdowns have the power of Christ, obviously can't get heavier than that
p6469
aVall of my kek
p6470
aVIdk Portraits is pretty heavy compared to most metalcore bands. 
p6471
aVA day to remember, Architects, Blessthefall, The Amity Affliction are all really good bands with amazing recent stuff, go check them out :).
p6472
aVI agree with you man. Even BMTH isn't as heavy anymore. \u000a\u000a- Try Amity Affliction. Listen to RIP Bon, Open Letter, Chasing Ghosts and Anchors for starters. \u000a\u000a- Blessthefall is still awesome. Beau Bokan picked up the band really well when the old vocalist left the band. Saw them live. Beau Bokan (new vocalist), amazing frontman. I met the band last year. Listen to their new album, Hollow Bodies. Listen to Hollow Bodies and You Wear A Crown But You're No King for starters. \u000a\u000a- Suicide Silence. This varies really. Mitch (old vocalist) died and a new one replaced him. Many think they don't like Eddy (the new vocalist) but I personally like him. He saved the band well, IMO. Listen to You Can't Stop Me, Fuck Everything, Cease To Exit. \u000a\u000a- Upon A Burning Body. THEY ARE AMAZING. Saw them live first at Mayhem and damn they really know how to please the crowd. They have a rendition of Turn Down For What so try that first. As for original songs, try: Scars and Sin City\u000a\u000aEDIT: Added UABB

p6475
aV&gt; fun, aggressive, and breakdown heavy music\u000a\u000aCheck out ETID man.  Not as breakdown heavy as other bands, way more mathy but there are a few here and there.  But in terms of fun and aggression look no further.\u000a\u000aedit: [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVmlf6koQXA)
p6476
aVExactly what I would have said, they are catchy, fast and aggressive and some of there breakdowns are just so epic
p6477
aV&gt;Basically my question is; are there any bands out now that are still making fun, aggressive, and breakdown heavy music?\u000a\u000aNo.\u000a\u000a...Thanks for reminding me, asshole. :(
p6478
aVChunk! No, captain chunk! is pretty upbeat. I don't know if they're technically classified as metalcore or post hardcore though. 
p6479
aVThey remind me a lot of A Day to Remember, and I consider them metalcore.
p6480
aVErra.\u000a\u000aBreakdown of Sanity. \u000a\u000aVolumes.\u000a\u000aWithin the Ruins. \u000a\u000aThe Human Abstract. \u000a\u000aBorn of Osiris. 
p6481
aVI'm kind of late to the party but you should try some The Paramedic if you haven't heard of them. They are generic as fuck and they are really breakdown heavy and they have some fun angry lyrics, listen to Have A Nice Day and tell me what you think.\u000aAnd also... Do yourself a favor and stay away from their song Back To The Start.\u000a\u000aI would also recommend Fit For A King. Their lyrics are serious but they are heavy as fuck and they have some amazing choruses!
p6482
asVTommy Giles most versatile vocalist?
p6483
(lp6484
VI'm not a vocalist, but I think Stu Block is pretty versatile. Here's [Timeless Winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nQ4ZR-NI6A) he did when he was in Into Eternity. And [Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vz4yIgnFt0) with his current band.

p6504
aVa lot of bands that have a more raw sound (typically found in hardcore bands) want the mix to sound like this. it's weird and compressed yes, but it does give it a certain kind of untouched fervent punch.

p6532
aVTheir first album has acoustic stuff.
p6533
aVTrue, However you had me at hello is  great song and it was only 1 from an album. The last 2 albums have had 5 heavy songs between them. 
p6534
aVI hope for more Old Record type music
p6535
aVAs someone who hardly has time to find out about this stuff. Thank you for posting On, this made my day. Can't wait! 
p6536
aVThat was a quick turnaround between albums! 
p6537
aVSomewhat worryingly quick.
p6538
aVThey had CC written for a while before they could release it. They also have said numerous times that they had upwards of 30 songs written while putting it together. So I'm not too worried. Also it said they're going to start recording, so they probably just have a time booked. It won't be till the end of this year or the beginning of next year that we should expect a whole album from them.
p6539
aVADTR have said a few times before that they write on the road so when working on a new album they have songs ready and can head straight into the studio. It could be Summer (new material for festivals) or just after that we here it
p6540
aVMakes sense. I need to stop looking for things to worry about, like the pessimist I am. 
p6541
aVI understand your fear though...I try too hard to find ways to make myself not worry about it. 
p6542
aVHow? This will be out come the two year mark, like most album cycles. CC should've been out 2012, too. All on pace.
p6543
aVDidn't take into account CC's delay. My bad. 
p6544
aVCC was their best imo hope they continue with that sound
p6545
aVu wot m8?
p6546
aVSome of us like CC and WSMFY more
p6547
aVI'm really confused as to why people want a strictly metalcore FTWHH kind of album. They're not just metalcore, and their other stuff is really good and it's what they like to do. Also, why would you ever want a band to make a copy of a previous album?
p6548
aVSeriously, going back to playing generic AtTheGatescore would be awful, it's such a dated and outplayed sound now. Common Courtesy was a huge success and a few steps up from WSMFY. I'm excited to see what they have in store, as always.
p6549
aVI loved Common Courtesy. Hope they keep that sound up!
p6550
aVI really love ADTR but I hope they right some more varied breakdowns this time. Almost all of them, across all albums, sound pretty much the same. Gets a bit boring after a while.
p6551
aVI want to be, but I can't get excited for this... 
p6552
aVMake it all heavy. PLEASE. No more Pop-Punk.
p6553
aVHow have people not figured out that ADTR are a fusion band? They play a little heavy, they play a little soft. 
p6554
aVSeriously! ADTR aren't as popular as they are because of their heavy stuff, it's because of their catchy poppy tunes. They aren't going to completely disregard that fan base who likes their softer music just like how they won't abandon their heavier roots for their long time fans. ADTR are one of the only bands in the metalcore genre that I can tolerate the clean and poppy vocals. No, they didn't reinvent the wheel or anything but they have a formula and they can perfectly execute it. 
p6555
aVI'm really glad and a little surprised that they haven't stopped doing heavier tracks.
p6556
aVEspecially after WSMFY the future of a heavy ADTR seemed bleak. I was very pleased with the sound of CC. Life Lessons Learned The Hard Way is definitely one of their heaviest songs to date.
p6557
aVReally? I thought WSMFY was their heaviest album. Second Sucks, You be tails and stick ands bricks are proper metalcore songs.
p6558
aVYeah, but besides those 3 songs, the rest of the album was entirely pop-punk. Compared to Homesick, there was way less metalcore songs or parts. And FTWHH had metalcore elements in almost every song.
p6559
aVWat? Homesick has  a breakdown in almost every song. WSMFY only has 2 heavy songs... 
p6560
aVPop-mosh and proud
p6561
aVnoo, they were never pop punk until WSMFY, and it's generic as shit too. Sounds like any other pop punk band.
p6562
aVBoth Monument and Here's to the Past off FTWHH are borderline pop punk, not to mention The Price We Pay is a very soft song off the same album. Moreover, Homesick had Downfall of Us All, NJ Legion Iced Tea, Homesick, and Another Song About the Weekend.\u000a\u000aThere's no denying that ADTR has had punk and pop punk influences from their earlier days. WSYFM wasn't there first album with pop punk, nor will it be their last.
p6563
aVMan... I like a DISRESPECT YOUR SURROUNDINGS song as much as the next guy, but the songs you mention are some of my favorites from ADTR. I like the band for what they are. There are thousands of metalcore and deathcore bands out there that make great heavy music, no need for ADTR to be the same all the time.
p6564
aVHave you listened to Old Record at all?! Some quality pop punk on that album.
p6565
aVAren't they a pop punk band?

aVI hope it doesnt sound like Common Courtesy, not many good songs on that album. Which is wierd coming from ADTR a band that has so many good songs that it's hard to choose a favorite.

aVOli must have improved a lot since I heard him live a few years ago.
p6650
aVHe has. His vocals on a track such as Pray For Plagues or Diamonds Aren't Forever wont be as raw anymore, but when he gave up the drugs his cleans improved drastically.
p6651
aVHe never did cleans whilst he was addicted to K. Sempiternal is all about getting over his addiction and he didn't sing before that album.\u000a\u000ait's still true that his vocals have improved a lot over the last year or two, though.
p6652
aVI honestly thought he was lip syncing for about 3/4 of it until he held out the mic and his vocals stopped. Completely blown away with how great his voice is now.
p6653
aVI wonder if Oli's vocals were altered in the post production of this footage. I love the band, but I find it mildly suspicious that he sounds off in all the live footage I've viewed of him, but he sounds basically perfect in this one.
p6654
aVIt probably was, but I'm not gonna deny that he's improved a shit ton over the last couple years.
p6655
aVHe's improved A LOT in the last year. Just watch [this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlDLnv9WT4)
p6656
aVHe sounded basically the same live, sounded like they were playing a CD for most of it. This is re-edited though, there are bits where the inflection in his voice is slightly different than it was live so I think they've mixed parts of the live audio with the original, studio recorded track. He's really improved a lot though, even Pray for Plagues sounded amazing and I was expecting that era of their music to suck now but he blew everyone away.
p6657
aVGod fucking damn he ***NAILED*** those vocals. I want to see BMTH live again now :(

aVThis sent shivers down my spine.

p6670
aVI forgot they played at Wembley last year. As for this performance, I bet their record label got payed for this big time. So I can imagine the label gave them a really long time to make the setlist/practice. So I am not surprised at all that the sound was on key for most of it.

p6731
(lp6732

p6733
aVHow can you tell if you scream through your throat and not your diaphragm?
p6734
aVIf you're screaming from your diaphragm, you should feel your stomach tighten and your throat won't hurt
p6735
aVYeah I don't think I do that, haha
p6736
aVAh, might want to fix that then
p6737
aVI've been doing it since I heard about Matt Tuck's throat problems years ago. There was an article in Kerrang magazine that said he'd been to a vocal coach and that made me look into vocal training for metal. Nowadays most screamers put up tutorials on youtube but I find they tend to say the same things. I'll list a few of the common ones.  \u000a  \u000a1. Warm up. There's good videos online but you should warm up your throat before screaming as with all singing. I tend to hum scales and then low sing them but there's loads of ways to do it.  \u000a2. Know your range. Not everyone can do everything, most of my highs sound like shit, especially if my voice isn't on top form so I stick to a lot of lows. You can really hurt yourself over exerting your voice to be trying to hit notes you can't do as it takes serious training to be able to do all, some naturally can but it's rare.  \u000a3. Hydrate. Simple, but once your throats dry screaming gets terrible.  \u000a4. Rest. Once your voice starts to hurt, rest it. Same as any part of your body, you will seriously fuck it up if you push it while it's in pain.  \u000a5. Practice. If there's a particular type of screaming you're trying to do, practice at it. Eventually you will get there, but it takes time to learn techniques of voice modulation.  \u000a6. Breathe. You need good breathing for good screaming. All good roars come from the chest, not from shredding your vocal cords. Breathe deep, and try to breathe through your nose a lot, clear airways are important and breathing in through your mouth can dehydrate.  \u000a  \u000aThere's more but youtube and google are your friend here, a lot of deathcore vocalists put tips up, ask if you have any specific questions?
p6738
aVThis. 100% this. [Way to go, bing-bong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnMalCuytHA)
p6739
aVJust practicing and getting the hang of a basic level of screaming (at whatever your most comfortable range is) is the biggest, as far as sounding good and being able to sing songs I mean. It's not super intuitive at first, and you'll initially get a basic technique but not really something you can do much with.\u000a\u000aBut as you get more and more used to utilizing the correct vocal control it becomes a great deal more natural. After a little while the execution becomes second nature and you can more easily experiment with different areas of range. Don't try and go crazy all over the place from the get-go. \u000a\u000aBreathing is what impresses me a lot with some vocalists. Some of those parts require a great deal of breathe. 
p6740
aVThis is a solid set of tips!\u000a\u000aI usually just scream for the fun of it (like scaring people lol) or along with the music, but it's definitely important to know how to do it right!
p6741
aVAlso, use your diaphragm, is something I see everywhere. And its true. Push with your diaphragm, not throat.
p6742
aVI thought I tore a vocal cord the other day singing Attila in the car. So no, I'd say I can't
p6743
aVI burst a blood vessel in my eye singing a long to Writing on the Walls the other day. I suddenly felt a pain in my eye and looked in the mirror and saw the red. I don't know if I should try anymore.
p6744
aVthat's brutal
p6745
aVI sing along to Writing on the Walls all the time, now I'm worried...was it during the "WE WALK ALONE" bit?
p6746
aVHaha I can't remember exactly when, somewhere in the middle, it may have been that.
p6747
aVThat part used to screw up my voice all the time before I got used to screaming, lol.
p6748
aVI watched a shitload of Youtube tutorials and then kept trying until I found the right technique (that didn't hurt my throat--this is crucial. If your throat hurts at all while scremaing, stop immediately and rest for a day or so. Don't even risk damaging your vocal chords.) and then I just practiced by screaming along to my favourite bands. Also drink LOTS of water.
p6749
aV[Check out Ryan Strain's tutorial!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrSXmRutALs)
p6750
aVThis.  Ryan Strain knows his shit.
p6751
aVYeah I can, I do it averagely but what I found is that I'm quite limted as my voice is deep as so my highs don't sound right and I learnt from a friend in a band and youtube clips but to be honest I'm not fully aware of the techinque I use as its become second nature, watch heaps of clips and PRACTICE lots as that matters a lot, you will start off shit and be shit for ages haha
p6752
aVKinda, I never put too much time into practicing since it's nothing I would ever really do outside of singing(screaming) along with songs, pretty much just have the basic fundamentals down after doing it on and off for like 2 years
p6753
aVI got started when I put on some loud music and let 'er rip. As I became more and more comfortable with the sound I looked into refining my technique and have settled into a nice and brutal false chord sound.
p6754
aVMelissa Cross &amp; The Zen of screaming. 1 &amp;2
p6755
aVYeah I can, not too well though. I just learned from youtube tutorials. \u000a\u000aQuick crash course: \u000a\u000aDo the batman voice, or like a long drawn out sigh of exasperation. Then do it harder and lower. Boom, false-chord/growl.  \u000a\u000aNow bark like a pit bull. Like "Ruff!" or "roof" or whatever. Push that sound, and make it higher or lower. That's a mid false chord. \u000a\u000aFry screams? Make the Marge Simpson groan noise. Open your mouth. Thats a fry scream. \u000a\u000aThese will all sound like shit when you start, but keep practicing. Always practice, every day, but don't hurt yourself. If it hurts, stop. \u000a\u000aAlso being good at singing will help, and vice versa. So get decent at singing (breathing, volume control, stuff like that) and you'll probably be able to scream better or have an easier time learning.
p6756
aVI've been screaming for a few years now, and it really comes down to having your screams come from your core (diaphragm), and make sure you warm up well before you tear shit up. Once you learn how to properly, it is a blast. 
p6757
aVI can. I have been doing vocals since i was 15, i am 18 now. I can't tell you anything about it that has not been covered earlier in this thread. I only got 1 advice for you that i got from a friend, [you may know him from youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4IZ9Xz13BU). He says ''If you wanna scream, then fucking scream. You need to have kind of a *dont give a fuck* attitude about it.'' This helped me quite a lot. I suggest you just try to make some sounds, don't try to scream along to your favorite songs right away. Try to see if you can create some screams or growls before you started covering songs. Good luck buddy\u000a
p6758
aVI don't know exactly how I do it, but I do high and low death growls, kind of like Mitch Lucker. the way I would describe it is like the noise you make when you're trying to cough up phlegm, but you concentrate the sound to your liking.
p6759
aVSame rules everyone is saying. use your diaphragm not your throat, and if your throat hurts stop. \u000a\u000aBut I basically put on Young and Aspiring by UnderOath and tried to sound like Spencer. I mean I don't sound like him at all but it did teach me how to do it. And then you develop your sound as you go. I've started getting more into hardcore so now my scream has a bit more of a yell sound to it. 
p6760
aVI'd like to think I can. I actually starting out doing growls first as they're less intense to perform and less straining on your vocals cords and in general come easier.   \u000a \u000aWhile practicing the growls for a year or so I learned about proper breathing, warming up and projecting my voice.  \u000a \u000aWith my growls improving my clean vocals also improved a lot, I should note that at the beginning I had no clue how to sing at all, i sung flat, emotionless and without any volume.  \u000a  \u000aMy screams actually came after all that, about 3 years into being a vocalist. The way I scream is basically combining my head voice with a rasp/distortion. I believe it's a similar technique to what Chester Bennington uses, but right now I sound more like Caleb Schomo, the whole technique is still kind of new to me.  \u000a \u000aSome safe tips I can probably give you are:  \u000a* Learn about proper breathing technique.    \u000a* Learn about warming up your voice. Top athletes don't try to set a new record without warming up their muscles and neither should you.  \u000a* Practice a lot, but don't practice to the point where it hurts. In my first 2 years I practiced an hour a day divided into 2 segments of 30 minutes (driving from home to work worked wonders).  \u000a
p6761
aVGet the fundamentals down, no one can tell you exactly how to do it, because everyone has their own style.  However, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9MPYY7vtrQ) helped me get the the basics which eventually helped me build my unique sound.  I can now say, after a few years of practice, that i have perfected the high fry scream and low growl, with minimal to no discomfort.  I'm still working on managing my air, however i can keep the high scream for a decent amount of time, coming close to the likes of Austin Carlile's scream up-times from [old Attack Attack!.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3_L6NFBjs)\u000a\u000aAlso, another tip i would give is find a vocalist you like, and try to mimic their scream sound.  While you aren't trying to copy it, hearing it allows you to adjust the sound, and kind of get a feel for the type of screams you prefer to do.  Also, you always need a goal to strive for, so saying something along the lines of "I'm going to practice till i sound like him" is also a good way to measure your progress.  Again i want to stress that there are ALOT of techniques for screaming and that these are just the things that helped me get the sound i wanted.   
p6762
aVI'm not so good anymore, but i watched a shitload of videos on youtube and i have torn my voice several times doing shit improperly. \u000a\u000aMy main enemy is confidence, i sound like shit when i sing, scream, or even talk without confidence. Just tell yourself that you CAN do it, and try not to think about it too much
p6763
aVI learned for the reason you mentioned, because I wanted to sing and scream along with my favorite songs. Everything /u/TheStormCallsYou said is pretty much spot on, also I'd like to add that if you have asthma like me make sure you take your inhaler at least 15 minutes before you warm up. And take it once more than what's recommended on the box, opens your lungs up so much better 
p6764
aVTrial and error to find a way I didn't fuck up my throat
p6765
aVI find my highs are great, I can low exhale okay, (think  ADTR) I just can't exhale gutteral, I'm slowly getting better. But I can throw some old school Chelsea Grin inhales, I feel brutal covering Crewcabanger xD
p6766
aVI taught myself how through various YouTube videos &amp; written tutorials back when I was like 14 or 15. As others have said, it's all about the diaphragm.

aVI can play bass and scream! Let's make shitty myspace metalcore a thing again. 
p6798
aVwhat do you mean 'can't wait'?
p6799
aVidk man I just miss the days when blatant autotune, overuse of semitones, and cheesy synth was the standard (srs)
p6800
aVwell yeah me too but you say it like it's inevitable that metalcore is going to be like that soon again
p6801
aV1. Musical trends are pretty cyclical so the style will probably resurface in one form or another before too long\u000a\u000a2. I am full of conviction I can't place that the second coming of crabcore is as true and certain as the changing of the seasons
p6802
aVactually there's been talk and rumors and articles going around lately that a scene revival is about to happen. which would mean a crabcore revival:) 
p6803
aVAustin should see this video. Maybe he'd remember music can be fun.
p6804
aVI've heard this from so many different sources, but can someone ELI5, what he's done that makes him such a douche?\u000a\u000aI'm not doubting it, just curious
p6805
aVNot a douche in my opinion at all. I love the guys music. But go from attack attack, to om&amp;m. The music gets less and less fun. But it's their band. They can do whatever they want.
p6806
aVThey can also do what the record label wants.
p6807
aVNostalgia
p6808
aVAustin having fun hearing their own songs looks so funny
p6809
aVWhen Austin wasn't saving lives and they were actually having fun :((
p6810
aVThe best part is that they know that what they're doing is ridiculous. They have no idea if it'll work, but it didn't matter. Imagine if they coulda seen how that song/record would shape the scene and their lives...also Austin still looks like a douche. 
p6811
aVIt's such a shame really. These guys are like all best friends and just doing it to have fun, but unfortunately AA! mainly fell apart due to countless member disputes. It's sad.
p6812
aVthe synth master in his prime, incredible. 
p6813
aVI wish the synthmaster would do another AMA about his days in AA!
p6814
aVLmao, you're still so miffed about that! 
p6815
aVno i just want another ama. ;_;
p6816
aVOur time will come again, MWM. 
p6817
aVWhat ever happened to that documentary that AA! was going to release?
p6818
aVI believe Andrew Wetzel said they just got lazy and never got around to it lol.
p6819
aVI watch this video once a month to boost my self esteem
p6820
aVWe used to play beer pong and put this video on the TV looped.  \u000aIt would make everything better after someone would decide to flash their balls mid-toss to derail the game.
p6821
aVi cri evertim
p6822
aVWoah, has Caleb even hit puberty yet in this video?
p6823
aVHe was 16, so half way done
p6824
aVCrazy how young he was by 18 he was the face of the band. 
p6825
aVWhen can double lip piercings make a comeback?
p6826
aVThe scenecore dream is alive and well in my heart, and this video inspires me to bring it back in full force. Just need to buy some neon shirts again. 
p6827
aVAs a recent Beartooth fan who paid no attention to Attack Attack during their heyday, it's so weird to see Caleb Shomo rocking the black emo hair and double lip piercings, playing the synthesizer. I didn't even realize it was him at first, even though I knew he was in the band at the time. 
p6828
aVCall Triple A! 
p6829
aVMy favorite thing Austin Carlile has ever said
p6830
aVLOL. I had such huge crushes on dudes that looked like that back in high school. The more straight hair in your face, the better. 
p6831
aVThey seem like nice girls.
p6832

VAh, damn, haven't listened to this band in about 3 years, forgot about them\u000a\u000aEdit: Turns out they're also playing pretty close to my town in a month, this is great, bands pretty much never come to western Massachusetts
p6843
aVTheir new album is pretty good\u000a
p6844
aVCool, I'll check it out, I haven't listened to anything from them after Truth and Purpose
p6845
aVMy favorites are Swine Cult, Soul Seek, and Chain Breaker. Overall I think it's better than T&amp;P. 
p6846
aVJust listened to it, not bad, but I think I still liked Truth and Purpose more
p6847
aVAh, good to know, I was in the middle of practicing my vocals before, but I'll check it out now
p6848
aVlol they posted about it before i could agree with them on a time, yolo.\u000a\u000athanks for making this post
p6849
aVYessssss
p6850
aVJust saw them in orlando and they were amazing it was the first time I had ever seen them and I just fell in love with their music
p6851
asVWhat is your opinion on "grimy", "dirty" vocals?
p6852
(lp6853
Vthe sludgier the better
p6854
aVPersonally I really dig them. A lot of people can't stand it, but I feel that I can feel the emotion. The screechy, dirty vocals add a whole new level to the lyrics.
p6855
aVI really dig it, a lot of stuff I post here has really dirty vocals and gets no upvotes haha
p6856
aVRelevant flair? I don't come on this sub much but Converge was definitely an acquired taste for me.
p6857
aVFlair is very relevant haha I'm not the biggest fan of typical metalcore or most metalcore. Its an acquired taste, but its mainly just hard to get into initially 
p6858
aVThe distress the US tour is the epitome of what I'm talking about, lol. But it really grows on you. I love it
p6859
aVa bit more post hardcore - but fallen from the sky has some of the best dirty vocals: \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD4phRfUCjE
p6860
aVNever listened to either of those, would [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPPPGMGNg8I) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN1roEt7CVI) count?
p6861
aVGod damn, Skeletonwitch is so awesome! I kind of thought of them too at first. Their vocals remind me of black metal vocals, but they're definitely pretty dirty sounding. Gotta get more of their albums! I only have Forever Abomination. 
p6862
aV&gt;Gotta get more of their albums! I only have Forever Abomination.\u000a\u000aGo with either Breathing the Fire, or Beyond the Permafrost. Breathing the Fire if you want something faster and thrashier. Beyond the Permafrost if you want something with a little more bm atmosphere. 
p6863
aVI can see the appeal, though I don't listen to them much. It does hurt just to listen to them, though, and I'll probably avoid them in general, just to keep away from developing bad habits.
p6864
aVlove them. The plot in you, landon tewers, sworn in, gift giver, new Vanna. dank shit
p6865
aVDo you mean people who actually scream and not just do weird simulated vocal techniques?\u000a\u000aI totally prefer it. 100%. At least there is feeling in it, people taking classes and "perfecting" their vocal technique takes so much away from the the anger or what ever emotion they are trying to convey.\u000a\u000aSome how people have managed to make screaming sound fucking squeaky clean and that really bothers me.
p6866
aVExactly what you said, far too many over produced vocals. A lot of hardcore bands have great screams in my opinion like Trap them, Jungbluth, Code Orange, Calaviire (great band in the vein of Converge) , oathbreaker  and so many others
p6867
aVOh man, I forgot Code Orange. Ahhhh I love them. Reba with the high pitched screams live are great.
p6868
aVHaven't got to see them live yet, but she has mean vocals, they all do actually 
p6869
asVneed a little help with making a "home studio" on Interfaces..

VI'd say check over in /r/singing, or there's probably another better different sub that I don't know about. Unless you're talking about recording instruments, then maybe check out /r/guitar. There's also probably a sound engineering or recording sub somewhere. 
p6872
aVyeah i'm talking about recording guitar, thanks!
p6873
aVThere has to be better subreddits than this for this kind of questions
p6874
aVwell I don't know of any but I figured since this is the genre that I'm going to be recording that there would be some home recorders here to help me out.

p6891
aVI always think about music related tattoos in general and I just don't think I could bring myself to get one. I guess I wouldn't be up for getting one of any band in particular, but maybe some sort of imagery that reflects the sound.
p6892
aVThis.  But I always draw blanks when trying to think of an image that captures what this music is all about
p6893
aVI'm thinking of bringing in a picture of TesseracT's newest album as part of the inspiration for a new tat.
p6894
aVI have "True beauty lies beneath the skin, **BLEGH**" tattooed like a noose around my neck 
p6895
aVCame here for MMF lyrics, was not disappoint. I myself have the entirety of Challenger scribed in Roman calligraphy all over my ribcage, and a portrait of Tyler Carter staring thoughtfully at a lighthouse on my back, with "You're Not Alone" written under it in all the wrong Japanese characters. \u000a\u000aI'm also thinking about getting a chibi-drawn Ronnie Radke working at a bikini car wash on my bicep. Maybe then, u/ManWithoutModem-senpai will finally notice me...

p6906
aVIf Oh, Sleeper puts out another perfect album I'll heavily consider getting their symbol tatted on me. 
p6907
aVI kinda want to get a tattoo of Dillinger Escape Plan's feather design from their latest album.
p6908
aVMy first tattoo was a compass with "Know Hope" written under it.  I hope to get Architects lyrics this summer.

aVWatched the first few tracks before submitting, but just finished the rest and holy crap, this is phenomenal! Props to /u/hate5six!\u000a\u000aProbably the best attempt at capturing the energy and cohesiveness of their live act to date. Converge is such a visceral yet refined live show, and it's hard for vids to give them justice, but this nails it!
p6917
aVThis is such a huge compliment. I am beyond flattered. I take filming live music incredibly seriously and I'm humbled when people notice the attention to detail.

p6932
aVWhole-heatedly agree. After their EP, I couldn't wait to get my hands on their full-length (heh). It left a lot to be desired in my opinion.
p6933
aVThat one's great too
p6934
aVWhat are your thoughts on the album?

p6948
aVHe looks like a skinny Seth Rogan.
p6949
aVSounds like him too
p6950
aVthe "oh my god" at the end was about as Rogan as you can get. 
p6951
aVI've done the Price is Right before, and can totally imagine the producers loving Adam D. You queue up to fill out paperwork and stuff for a few hours before the taping, and a part of it is a short group interview with the producers. They ask what you do and maybe a random question like why you're excited for the show. I imagine Adam D being his usual self and telling them he's in a metal band called Killswitch Engage and they loved it.
p6952
aVAdam is honestly my favorite guy in the scene. Such a funny dude.
p6953
aVI'm dying. Lol that's so hilarious. And the fact that he won just takes it over the top, tho I wouldn't expect anything less from Adam D.
p6954
aVAnd he did it all in sandals, which is the funniest part of this to me for some reason
p6955
aVThe funniest part of the video is how the last woman who bid 925 had no idea how the game worked. If all the bidders are over everyone bids again.
p6956
aVFuck the cock monger in the comment section who says he doesn't deserve it. That guy is painted green with jealousy.
p6957
aVhahahaha holy shit the big metal roar he lets out every time he wins something. So good.
p6958
aVI wonder how "regular" people reacted to him.
p6959
aVYou realize this guy isn't just the guitarist for a famous metal group. He basically shaped the modern metalcore sound by producing for bands like Parkway Drive and Unearth.
p6960
aVAaaand As I Lay Dying, All That Remains, Norma Jean, The Devil Wears Prada, the list goes on..

aVI've said it once and I'll say it again, I absolutely love the music from this album, but I just can't listen to those screams.
p6994
aVReally? I was late to this album, only listened to Barbarian and Your Little Suburbia Is In Ruins until I got the whole thing in 2011. Anyways, I thought this was Jake until I looked up more info on it.
p6995
aVI love Jake's vocals so much that these practically stick out like a sore thumb. However, the grab the wheel part of Barbarian is badass. 
p6996
aVCompletely agree with you, really hoping they re-record it with Jake at some point
p6997
aVThat would be sick, though I would prefer new music over it. But why not both? 
p6998
aVI agree, but a re-recorded version of Thrill Seeker would be cool too\u000a\u000aEdit: The main reason I think that might happen is that JB mentioned it as a possibility in an interview or AMA a while ago

sVIn Hearts Wake - Departure (feat. Winston McCall)
p7074
(lp7075
VI feel like In Hearts Wake is really good at shifting their music (even just slightly) to sound like the person they have featured in the song. So you'll notice right as Winston comes in the drums change up just a bit and the song overall sounds a little bit like a PWD song.  \u000aThey do it in [Earthwalker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ0QCx792gI) when Joel from TAA comes in. The guitars sound a bit more Amity-like, and the vocal effect at ~1:33 is staight out of Amity's playbook. Just something I noticed.
p7076
aVI definitely agree, they're really good at changing it slightly to fit the guest vocals. It's the same in Shapeless when Adrian comes in, it just changed to a bit more of a Northlane vibe. It really adds to the song.
p7077
aVYeap, i always thought departure sounded pretty PWD like
p7078
aVAbsolutely, 'Shapeless' is straight up Northlane even without Adrian's part, I really like that about IHW.
p7079
aVBefore I say this, I love In Hearts Wake. Favorite up and coming band\u000a\u000aWith that being said why does this have a Popular band tag? 
p7080
aVWondering the same thing. Popular Band tag is definitely not warranted.
p7081
aVMaybe it's from an Australian point of view, In Hearts Wake would definitely be considered "popular" in the Australian scene. 
p7082
aVThey're home town heroes that's for sure. Maybe the mod is from Byron Bay.
p7083
aVYeah, I've barely ever heard of them. That tag is usually reserved for August Burns Red, Parkway Drive (Maybe because it features Winston?), The Devil Wears Prada, and occasionally, Bring Me the Horizon.
p7084
aVBecause Winston McCall is in it, I assume. He's a popular guy.

aVi haven't legitimately jerked TDWP in months
p7228
aVI've been living in the past....
p7229
aVBleghs and disgusting noises in general and/or songs that start off with a long scream, like these:\u000a\u000a[Aversions Crown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tFYdzSB8bI&amp;t=2m43s)\u000a\u000a[Make Them Suffer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4sFt1ARmrE&amp;t=4m0s)\u000a\u000a[All That Remains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raRHUG0PkQU)\u000a\u000a[Devil You Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-SRDiJlRg8)\u000a\u000a[Whitechapel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAdnHZMj7n4)
p7230
aVWhy is that a guilty pleasure?
p7231
aVyea I kinda realized the songs I linked werent the best examples of ''guilty'' pleasures, but there are some bands that I just listen to for those ''blegh'' moments, like Like Moths to Flames, Of Mice &amp; Men, etc.
p7232
aV&gt;songs that start off with a long scream\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NyMGQd6BlE\u000a\u000aOne of my all-time favorite intro screams
p7233
aVYessss, I was gonna link that too but I figured I already used them as an example, Make Them Suffer is best
p7234
aVSynth breakdowns. Sure they are overdone most of the time but theres a ton of good ones too.
p7235
aVYou probably really like Enter Shikari then
p7236
aVSurprisingly, I only listen to a few songs by them. My usual synth go to's are the browning, fail emotions, and his statue falls.
p7237
aV+1 for Fail Emotions, those guys are great
p7238

aVMakes sense considering their not even metalcore. More post hardcore/experimental
p7240
aVHave you tried Horse the Band?
p7241
aVYea i tries to get into them but i just couldnt.
p7242
aVIt's all about Dear Love era TDWP. The synth breakdown at the end of Dogs Grow Beards All Over is beautiful.
p7243
aVThis. Nothing is quite like the Dear Love album. Still trying to find music that sounds like it!

p7245
aV[deleted]
p7246
aVThe use of really cheesy synths in a song(Stick Stickly, AA's cover of Right Now, We Butter The Bread With Butter's first 2 albums). I don't know, it kinda makes a song more fun. A nice touch i guess.\u000a\u000aOther things like catchy drums, chuggy guitars &amp; high vocals(Jonny Craig, Tyler Carter, Devin Oliver, Michael Swank) are what i usually crave for.
p7247
aVif u like old school AA and havent already, check out house vs. hurricane specifically the Forfeiture EP and Perspectives.
p7248
aVWeird atmospheric/proggy bits in the middle of heavy songs\u000a\u000aEdit: Not really a guilty pleasure I guess, just something I really like in songs
p7249
aVNorthlane is good for that. 
p7250
aVThey definitely are, one of my favorite bands
p7251
aVCatchy as hell choruses with soaring vocal harmonies. Blissful 
p7252
aVIssues has perfected this. 
p7253
aVCan definitely agree 
p7254
aVGuilty? \u000a\u000aProbably when a vocalist screams something stupid before a breakdown (like in "Hypocrisy" by Sworn In).\u000a\u000aThis doesn't include that CTC breakdown.
p7255
aVI love that line lol
p7256
aVTAKE YOUR NECKLACE OFF AND PUT A FUCKING NOOSE IN ITS PLACE *breakdown*
p7257
aV....Blegh!
p7258
aV"SO TAKE YOUR NECKLACE OFF AND PUT A FUCKING NOOSE IN ITS PLACE! BLEGH!"\u000a\u000aI love Sworn In, even bought a few of their songs but the first time I heard that line I just chuckled.
p7259
aVThe phrases before the breakdown, the only reason I like the song never say die by any given day is because of the SURPRISE motherfucker breakdown
p7260
aVSongs that take the piss even if I know they are complete garabage like the hardcore 2 step song otherwise not ashamed of anything.
p7261
aVI love a good solo occasionally
p7262
aVPersonally, and as a guitarist I apologize for this, but I hate guitar solos in most metalcore songs. I guess that's a guilty pleasure, I'd rather have a good breakdown than a ripping and shredding solo.
p7263
aVI agree with you but occasionally I enjoy one
p7264
aVI suppose if I had to pick something I was reluctant to admit I was fond of it'd be the poppier side of the genre. High vocals, electronics, more breakdowns and less riffs, that sort of thing.  Stuff like Attack Attack!, I See Stars, and Palisades.  It's not always my go to, but I enjoy a wide variety of bands this genre provides both ridiculously heavy and outrageously poppy.  Keeps things interesting. 
p7265
aVHeavy as fuck breakdowns, with massive 808 bass drops.\u000a\u000aThose make me wet.
p7266
aVNo guilty pleasures. I just enjoy the things I enjoy. Pussy-ass high singing? Love that shit. Genericore? Can't get enough.
p7267
aVWell, maybe my only guilty pleasure would be listening to Falling in Reverse sometimes. Because I feel guilty for supporting Radke. But not for digging their songs.

p7281
aVIf only it didnt have all that deadly shit... but yea their videos are always in some amazing looking location.
p7282
aVI'm going to be completely honest, Australia isn't as deadly as it's made out to be.
p7283
aVIt doesn't need to be deadly, spiders in toilets is enough for me.
p7284
aVI'm liking the amount of love these guys are getting as of late. They deserve all of it. 
p7285
aVThey really do, I saw them a few weeks ago and was really impressed, they just seem like nice guys making music they love.
p7286
aVSO happy this album is happening, Earthwalker was AOTY for me last year and now they open with this awesome single and a re-mixed Skydancer which is incredible. These guys are becoming a fave for me, pre-ordering this next week!

aVFeels like yesterday when that came out.
p7299
aVShame the whiny cleans take up so much of the song. Biggest pitfall of this band. 
p7300
aVI really think this is an improvement from the cleans on some of their other songs. The rework of skydancer cleans was much better as well.\u000aBut yeah, Divination is hard to beat. 
p7301

p7312
aVI'll be the one wearing clothes as well! Twins!
p7313
aVWoo! I wonder if there will be anyone else there wearing clothes.
p7314
aVA bit of a disappointment imo, skydancer was so much better
p7315
aVSaw them last night in Dallas, opened for 68, Being as an ocean, The Amity Affliction, and Stick to your guns. They packed one hell of a punch for an opener, was surprised that they'd be better live than Amity. \u000a\u000aI'm a massive Amity fan but was disappointed because Joel appeared to be hammered, and Ahren's cleans on Pittsburgh were terrible. Glad to see IHW distinguishing themselves
p7316
aVJoel was wasted in Detroit as well lol, he was using a pole to hold himself up/leaning against it for a good part of the set. He still sounded decent tho. Sad to hear Ahren didn't sound good in Pittsburgh cause he sounded like an absolute beast when I saw them.

VThese guys deserve more love. Seen 'em live about 3 weeks ago. One of the best shows ever. These guys have a real cool perspective on things.  \u000a \u000aDuring their set the singer invited everyone over to hang out near the merchbooth after the show, saying that VIP packages are bullshit and that the way you get to interact with a band shouldn't be decided by how much money you have. I swear their singer and bass player hung out for like an hour before and two hours after their set.  \u000a\u000aI thought that was pretty genuine and cool.

aVYeah floorboards is very special and a bit too complex BUT if you give it a try it is really nice and after about 20 listenings I really enjoy it. Catchy lines. \u000a\u000a\u000aSorry can't help out with the sound-a-like band.

aVI remember deafheaven's sunbather was actually really good slowed down and speed up by 0.25

aVI don't know if I'd call that metalcore. Kinda Southern Punk Metal...or something. Not metalcore in the traditional sense anyway. Not in a bad way, but it wasn't what I was expecting to hear in this group.
p7416
aVSouthern metalcore/mathcore metalcore actually varies heaps.
p7417
aV&gt; southern punk metal\u000a\u000aThat's hardcore punk + southern metal, which would still be metalcore. Also no metalcore is still 'traditional' metalcore which was really just hardcore played with metal riffs.

aVOne of the better light shows I have seen.,and a solid set list to back it up. I want to see that drum part at the end again, that was pretty cool.

aVHaven't been to an ABR show so I have no idea what people wear to their gigs. \u000a\u000aI just thought you were serious.

aVIt's cool. Metal shows in general tend to be predominantly black.
p7431
aVFucking pissed I'm missing this show. Had 2 people get the AIDS flu at work, and I was supposed to get out early so I could go. The HOB is the best place to see a show around here. \u000a\u000aRock out for me, bro's.

aVI had to miss it too because I'm out of class at UCF too late on Mondays :/ wouldn't have been there in time. Least I was on the Less Than Jake stream a few weeks ago at HOB.

p7448
aVnails is so good, I love power violence / grindcore, weekend nachos is another favourete of mine 
p7449
aVWeekend Nachos slam so hard. I saw them in November with Harms Way and No Zodiac and it was NUTS
p7450
aVthat show sounds intense 
p7451
aVI never could get into weekend nachos, just the vocals. Your thoughts on Orchid? Someone once said they were emo violence haha

aVI don't mind orchid but its so hard to make out the vocals\u000a\u000ai find the latest weekend nachos is easier to understand\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plQRupKi9yI
p7453
aVI'll have to give that album a full listen, as I enjoyed that quite a lot I'm just not the biggest on growls you know. And what Shai Hulud?
p7454
aVthe band that literally coined the term metalcore, because they sound like metal and hardcore......so unlike 90% of the bands posted here even tho I like alot of them
p7455
aVCan you link or rec me some sings by them? I've mainly only heard some stuff that sounded really melodic
p7456
aVreach beyond the sun, a profound hatred of man, my heart bleeds the darkest blood, set your body ablaze 
p7457
aVThe amount of posts you make that include the words "Converge" and "Code Orange" are out of this world. Not complaining though, Nails is dope.
p7458
aVIts because those bands are sick as hahaha do you like them? Also they are mainly the only metalcore bands I dig except for mathcore and oathbreaker haha
p7459
aVI love Code Orange, not really into Converge but I like them from time to time.
p7460
aVCode Orange Kids actually got me into Converge  and were one of the first hardcore bands I liked so they are special to me and Converge were kind of the first metalcore band I liked, both in my top 5 artists.

aVSworn In. Album: The Death Card 
p7463
aVstart / end has dem bass drops tho
p7464
aVI 100% agree but I just figured the death card might be more approachable or at least known
p7465
aVAll I can say is yes
p7466
aVWell, I would recommend ABR, but it seems like you're already familiar with them, I'd say stuff from Miss May I's first two albums, Monument and Apologies Are For the Weak. Also Fit For a King, and even though they're more along the lines of melodic hardcore, Defeater, especially the songs Bastards and Warm Blood Rush
p7467
aVI enjoy ABR too much for it to be my anger jams. The riffs are too fun haha. \u000aLove me some Miss May I, never listened to Apologies though... Will have to give it a listen. 
p7468
aV&gt; never listened to Apologies though\u000a\u000aOh my god. I am so jealous of you right now. Enjoy.
p7469
aVAh, fair enough, I'd usually agree on ABR, but some songs like Poor Millionaire and Animals are great when I'm angry, also definitely check out Fit For a King, one of my favorite angry bands
p7470
aVNot metalcore, but when i'm pissed I give anything off Iowa by Slipknot a listen. People = Shit and Disasterpiece are both great for your particular mindset.
p7471
aVI'll try it, but there's generally something about Slipknot that makes me unable to listen to them. Thanks.
p7472
aVThats what I like to hear though, the open mindedness to try new things. Maybe in a different state of mind they will resonate with you, but if not thats cool too! Different strokes for different folks.

VI'm a big Sworn In fan, but they've ditched everything I like about them for autotuned choruses and even cheesier lyrics. Also, the production on this album is very underwhelming compared to the loud, raw sound on the death card. 
p7507
aVDefinitely Agree 
p7508
aVThat chorus is atrocious. I know it's not happening anytime soon or ever again but what I would give for them to release something like Start/End again.

aVI generally dislike Sworn In, but I actually really dig this song.  The lyrics are still pretty crap, but at least I can't hear them as much and there's a lot less whiny crybaby vocal shit.  I like the instrumentals a lot, I feel like this is actually a step up from their old stuff in that regard.

Every awesome band goes touring in the US for 10yrs, then make it an EU-tour where they basicly only plays in Germany, France and UK.

aVYeah he looks stiff as hell.
p7578
aVHis style is a lot like the circle of contempt drummers, albeit a lot less tight. He should use ghost notes more sparingly, I feel like they don't even come through on the single recording either
p7579
aVI was just gonna say, man those ghost notes damn!! I like it. 
p7580
aVI'm not musically inclined; can any drummer's tell me how you/these guys remember all the notes? I get that there is a general rhythm for each song, but how do they manage to play the same (or close) set each time and then do it again for a dozen more songs when they play live?
p7581
aVHow do you remember the lyrics to your favorite songs?
p7582
aVHe looks like an idiot savant playing drums for the first time. 
p7583
aVFucking dead at dude's face while he's playing 
p7584
aVThis guy feels like a really good drummer who just got word that metal heads cream their pants over ghost notes. So now he's trying to just throw them everywhere whether they sound good or not. He'd rather seem technical than sound good. Like what is that fill at 0:51? I don't care how off time your snare hits are if it sounds like butt.

p7586
(lp7587
sVArchitects - Broken Cross
p7588
(lp7589
VI'm a Christian and I actually like this song. \u000a\u000aI personally thinks it calls out Christians, which is something that needs to happen, because Christians today have a lot of things backwards. \u000a\u000aI personally think the song is a reminder that Christians need to love others, because they're who are supposed to show God's love. Obviously the vocalist does not feel God's love. That's a failure of Christians everywhere.\u000a\u000aThe song convicts me. \u000a\u000aIt also sounds fucking awesome. These guys are great live. 
p7590
aVSeems more like a rejection of God than calling out christians. As in even if God is real, he's still not a loving being, with all the suffering in the world and whatnot. Humans are fucked up, and the lyrics tell that God basically feels like we are a mistake and regrets creating us.\u000a\u000a(Not trying to ruin the song for you though. Bleh on, brother.)
p7591
aVThat's the beauty of music though. It can mean different things to different people.  
p7592
aVThat's just art/media in general. 
p7593
aVSure, I just went with music since that's the medium we're discussing. It fits.
p7594
aVNah man, I understand songs mean different things to different people. You're right about humans being fucked up. A lot of the suffering in the world could be solved if Christians actually loved people though. Not all of them, of course. But yeah! Cheers! 
p7595
aVI agree, it seems like it's more of a fundamental disagreement with Christianity rather than a disagreement with the actions of the church. BMTH's music usually seems like more of a "Christians are hypocrites" tone, and I feel like Architects are more of a "I don't understand how suffering/hate exist under a Christian God" tone. The first line of the song is kinda what gives it away for me, "God only knows why we were born to burn....." \u000a\u000aI don't agree with the content of the song, but it's definitely a viewpoint I can understand. 
p7596
aVChristianity's story (along with many other religions) start with the creation of humans with the hope that they would thrive, not "burn". It's human nature that caused humanity to fall, not a predetermined fate that we would fuck up. \u000aIn Christian viewpoints, God created people to be perfectly happy in the Garden of Eden , and just because the God is all-powerful doesn't require him to intervene. He may seem like a mean god, but the bible says people screwed up, not God.
p7597
aVI understand that, but I think the song is trying to make the point that a God who's merciful wouldn't allow those things to happen. 
p7598
aVAgreed, and I love the song. I can't disagree with the song's message, and even Silent Planet's new album is all about the same thing. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I like songs like this that challenge people to question their beliefs.
p7599
aVYeah for sure
p7600
aVIf you were a father who told his kids to do anything they wanted except for one thing, and that the consequences of the one thing would be horrible, and they did it anyway, would you let them suffer the consequence of their action, or go back on your word and give them a less severe punishment (Or no punishment at all)? 
p7601
aVOkay, I'll use your same example here. Let's say you had a son who did something absolutely terrible, I mean just abhorrent, that landed himself a life sentence in prison. Would you want him to be in prison? \u000a\u000aEven more important than that, let's say his wife was pregnant with your grandson. Would you send your grandson to live a life sentence in prison too? I mean, his father really screwed up, won't he be the same? Wouldn't it be best to just lock him up before he has a chance to really do something bad? \u000a\u000aFrom what I hear, that's really the point of the song. How could God do something like that to me if I was never given the chance? It seems like a fundamental disagreement with Christianity. Again, I don't agree with the viewpoint of the song, but I can understand the line of thought. 
p7602
aVNow the North Korean penalty system all makes sense. Kim Jong-un is literally God.
p7603
aVIrrefutable evidence. 
p7604
aVBut also, Christianity doesn't say that God causes suffering. According to the Bible, only man causes suffering. God doesn't fix everyone's problems because he wants people to live with their faults and see that they need him to rescue them. \u000a\u000aIf everyone were perfect and never had a problem, there would be no need for God. I'm a Christian because I see that I am a fundamentally flawed creature who needs something greater than myself to rescue me from this life that I've already screwed up pretty badly. 
p7605
aVHow did you screwed up pretty badly?
p7606
aVI've lied to people, I've stolen from people, I've done thing that I regret, I've been horrible to people, etc. Plenty of things that I've done wrong. 
p7607
aVWould I want him to be in prison? No. Would I let him out? No. He needs to understand the consequence of his actions. I wouldn't put the child in prison, but he also needs to see the consequence of his father's actions, so that he can learn from it. Instead of being in prison himself, he has to live with his dad being in prison, so likely not growing up with him, being basically constantly separated from him, never really knowing his father. To me, that would be worse than prison. Then he would be messed up because he didn't grow up with a father. Then his kid would be messed up because he didn't know how to be a father since he never had one. Then his kid would be messed up because his dad's dad didn't know how to be a father, so his dad didn't either, and now neither does he. \u000a\u000aSo on and so forth. One action introduces the problem for many generations. 
p7608
aVI actually had this come on my shuffle today and thought the same thing.  I'm Christian too and when I hear, "Hate must weigh on you like a broken cross" I think of the "Fire and brimstone" version of Christians and how they need to reform and be accepting of folks from all walks of life. Christianity is about love, not about being better than anyone else. Cheers!
p7609
aVWas going to say the same thing. I'm a Christian and I love this song. I don't arrive at the same answers but I resonate with the questions raised by the song. The existence of evil can be difficult to square with the existence of a loving God. If you're going to repudiate and reject God this is kind of the best music to use: Brutal, but beautifully sad too. 
p7610
aVYeah, I'd agree man. 
p7611
aVI love this song as an atheist because it reminds me that hate is actually what I'm supposed to be against. I'll admit sometimes I get very bitter about the subject of religion but this song makes me understand that you can't fight fire with fire. \u000a\u000aHate is the line that we should all strive not to step across. 
p7612
aVAgreed. \u000a\u000aSorry about whatever made/makes you bitter toward religion. Hope it is remedied soon! 
p7613
aVThere's always something very bad happening "because" of religion, so very unlikely.
p7614
aVYeah that's true. If everyone could just get along. 
p7615
aVI will never not upvote this song. Absolutely brilliant.

aVArchiblehcts
p7617
aVI saw Architects on tour with Stray from the Path as main support. There were never more Blehs said in one night.
p7618
aVThey are so good. Listening to The Distant Blue album right now. God a chance to them live back in November and it was one show I will never forget!
p7619
aVThis band is so incredible. They were fantastic live! I was so blown away by their performance. This album is definitely the best album of 2014 IMO. I can't get enough. \u000a\u000aSide note. I'm rocking a sticker for them on my prybar/screwdriver holder on my toolbox. \u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/b9s95YG.jpg
p7620
aVI saw them when they opened for Every Time I Die in my city recently.  They were so good that they almost stole the show.  I highly recommend.  I say "almost" because ETID was fuckin wild.
p7621
aVHaven't seen the nsfc tag until now. Amazing! 
p7622
aVIt gets used on pretty much every BMTH song
p7623
aVHaha, no shock. 
p7624
aVWhaaaat? Even on Chelsea Smile? Pretty sure that has a religious influence to it. 
p7625
aVI might be weird for this, but as a Christian who doesn't listen to certain bands based on their message/language, the tag is actually really useful to me. I hope it gets used more frequently where appropriate.\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: I still respect bands with a message like that of this song, and I think there's a place for it. I think there is something valuable that everyone can learn from it. I just prefer not to listen to it myself. 
p7626
aVDifferent strokes, not a big deal. Used to be Christian as a young lass. However I would listen to literally everything. 
p7627
aVI still am a Christian and listen to everything. If a song is going to somehow cause you to ditch your faith, there are bigger problems in your life than that song...
p7628
aVSo while acknowledging that there is something to learn, you state that you choose to ignore it... ignorance is bliss.
p7629
aVI feel like that's a thought pattern you have to have to be a Christian in this day and age. Yesyes, I have a neckbeard, a fedora and read the god delusion religiously. 
p7630
aVIt's required for being religious at all...
p7631
aVThey were very kickass when I saw them two days ago and this was the first song they played here. I also had fun in the pit since there were no seats and I didn't have that much experience before.\u000a\u000aWish it could've been longer but they played all of LF//LT (with the last and first song as the closer), two songs from Hollow Crown, two from Daybreaker, and one from The Here and Now.\u000a\u000aThey also announced in the show that their touring second guitarist is now an official member of the band so that's pretty cool.
p7632
aVITT: Christians whoring for upvotes on a le atheist song
p7633
aV"I'm Christian but I like this song, give me UpCarters for not having a narrow-minded idea of religion xD"
p7634
aVI'm a Christian and I FUCKING LOVE THIS FUCKING SONG!!! FUCK YEAH SAMMY KEEP THEM SCREAMS COMIN!
p7635
aVI love this song- particularly as someone who is distinctly unreligious- but how can you like it as a Christian?... It calls your god a fucking tyrant in a hollow crown? 
p7636
aVI like Silent Planet's music and I'm not Christian. Just because you don't agree with that band's beliefs doesn't mean you have to dislike their music. There's also the fact that Architects raise a fair point in this song, it's not just like 'fuck religion, god isn't real', which is basically what BMTH's House of Wolves is. 
p7637
aV&gt;Just because you don't agree with that band's beliefs doesn't mean you have to dislike their music\u000a\u000aObviously. I'm talking about this particular song, which basically calls this guy's god- who he (from his pov) has a strong personal relationship with- a cunt. The chords may sound nice but I'm wondering why the lyrics he'll be singing along to don't offend or upset him in any way. 
p7638
aVBecause the band raise a fair point?
p7639
aVIt's a middle finger against the corruption of organized religion, not my personal belief, that's how I enjoy it duhhhh 
p7640
aVBecause many people listen to music just for the music.
p7641
aVThis song became a hell of alot more powerful to me after contemplating what stephen fry said on the topic of god.
p7642
aVYou mean the problem of evil that has been around as long as Platonic theism?\u000a\u000aWhat he said was not profound or special.
p7643
aVI know. I guess call it coincidence that I listened to S.Fry and then this song in the space of like a minute.

p7663
aVNo question that I prefer AILD, like you. I really wanted to see them with KSE when they were getting ready to tour. Instead Tim had to go do his thing.
p7664
aVOh yeah, I remember they were about to tour with KsE before Tim's shit. I also wanted to go see them. It sucks listening to them now and just in the back of your head knowing what Tim tried to do.
p7665
aVYap, my favorite metalcore band. I stopped listening to them that often after everything happened with Tim. Wovenwar is good, but to be honest, Tim was a better singer than Shane.\u000a\u000aIt's a pity that they no longer exist, I think that the next album would be perfect. The last one was one of their best IMO, with songs as Resilience, My Only Home, Tear Out My Eyes.. The lyrics were really something, and they really were becoming better and better. Fuck you Tim.. fuck you
p7666
aVTim wasn't the singer, that's always been Josh. Shane doesn't do very many screams too so it's unfair to compare the two.\u000a\u000aThat being said, Shane and Josh's harmonies with Wovenwar are awesome.

asVTo those of you that play an instrument, who inspired you to start playing, or start playing metalcore more specifically?
p7740
(lp7741
VI've been playing for like 5 or six years i guess. I started because of Disturbed, but really it was Avenged Sevenfold that made me want to get better at guitar. I'm not sure when it was that I started liking metalcore, but I think it was Unholy Confessions and Second Heartbeat off Waking the Fallen. From there I got into stuff like War of Ages, and then Of Mice &amp; Men, Asking Alexandria, Alesana, Bring me the Horizon, and so on/
p7742
aVAhh, good ol' Disturbed. I feel like they are a gateway band to harder music, and still one of my favorite bands. I started off playing a lot of their stuff as well. I'm pretty sure Ten Thousand Fists was the first physical copy of an album I purchased with my own money.
p7743
aVYeah, Indestructible is what got me into metal. I rarely listen to them now. They're like one of the only bands I've been huge into but couldn't give a shit about now. 
p7744
aVI've been playing guitar for eight years.  I've been screaming for three.  I've been singing for one.  \u000a\u000aJohn Frusciante and Jimi Hendrix are my guitar idols.  They both make me cream.  \u000a\u000aI want to scream with the versatility and endurance that Ian from Rings of Saturn has.\u000a\u000aI want to sing like Jesse Cash or that dude from TesseracT. \u000a\u000aPractice makes perfect, kiddos.
p7745
aVI'm starting screaming too and the guys in Rings Of Saturn and Angelmaker are making me so motivated.
p7746
aVAshe or Dan from TesseracT? 
p7747
aVYes.\u000a\u000aI don't know.  Both. 
p7748
aVGood choice. 
p7749
aVI've been screaming for about three years now, and at first I was mostly influenced by bands like Motionless in White and Chelsea Grin, but when I got into August Burns Red in early 2013, Jake's vocals really inspired me to take it a lot more seriously, and practicing screaming ABR songs has really helped my vocals get a lot better over time
p7750
aVJakes vocals are really awesome to scream along with. 
p7751
aVThey definitely are
p7752
aVI started playing guitar ages ago and then stopped, but when I picked up last year La Dispute influenced me too, though now Kurt Ballou is influencing me more (but not up to skill)\u000a\u000aScreaming was the same, but right now Jacob Bannon and all the members of Code Orange are influencing my style.\u000a\u000aThough with screaming I've been thinking about trying to do amenra's thing or dillinger/ etid style 
p7753
aVBeing playing guitar for about 6-7 years, I'm only 17 - Metallica (thanks to their Guitar Hero title) got me into guitar. Bullet For My Valentine are the ones who converted me over to the "hardcore" / "metalcore" genres.
p7754
aVThe one who inspired my to pick up the the guitar was Tom Morello. The man came out with so many amazing riffs in both Rage and Audioslave. But once I started listening to metalcore, Chris Rubey was a huge inspiration. The Devil Wears Prada has so man earth shattering riffs like Born To Lose but then you get some sweet leads like Assistant to the Regional Manager.  Chris is just a really talented guitarist.
p7755
aVChris Rubey is huge to me too, the earlier stuff is simplistic yet awesome. 
p7756
aVI started screaming my freshman year of high school, and I'm a senior now so that's almost 4 full years. I was inspired by Mike Hranica and Austin Carlile, and I feel my style blends Austin Carlile's highs (on the OM&amp;M self titled) with Mike Hranica's lows (on Zombie/Dead Throne)
p7757
aVI really like Austin's highs, if you ever put material out or join a band I would love to hear how it sounds :)
p7758
aV&lt;3
p7759
aVStarted playing guitar about 8 years ago, was inspired to start playing by listening to metallica but within a year I was listening to metalcore starting with all that remains and atreyu.
p7760
aVUnderoath made me like heavy music, so Underoath.  \u000a\u000aBut Metallica taught me EVERYTHING I needed to know to play metal guitar. 
p7761
aVHonestly, I was inspired by School of Rock when it came out. I know that sounds lame, but seeing Zack (don't know his real name) play the guitar like that at 11 made me realize I probably could too.\u000a\u000aMetalcore-wise, As I Lay Dying, Parkway Drive, and August Burns Red have some of the coolest riffs, and I think I started playing those first. 
p7762
aVI started playing about 8 years ago but lost interest in it, but about Freshmen year I found A Day To Remember and I instantly began obsessing over them. Their simplistic formula and easy to do but awesome breakdowns made me pick up the guitar again. Every since then I've gotten a LOT better.

p7785
(lp7786
VYou did chose a relatively unpopular time on the sub haha only 27 people online. I hope others enjoy as much as me and sorry for replying again hahaha\u000a\u000aEDIT: the description is just amazing " it's like Meshuggah and The Dillinger Escape Plan had a baby and tortured it for hours on end." \u000a\u000aWhat could sound better?
p7787
aVNo worries with the replying thing haha. It's nice to have someone to talk to that enjoys Car Bomb. I guess I picked a bad time. Oh well. The Karma is nice, but it is great just to see other people enjoying them and hopefully a few of those people are new listeners.\u000a\u000aThat description is awesome. Those are both also two influences on them, as well as Squarepusher, Frank Zappa, Aphex Twin, and Converge. Quite wide selection of influence, but I guess that's one reason their stuff sounds so fresh.
p7788
aVYou introduced me too them by the way so that's one person and with the tag mathcore I'm sure you got some others too!\u000a\u000aI wouldn't have guessed the aphex twins to be honest but they do keep it original.\u000a\u000aOh you should get yourself a flair on the subreddit!
p7789
aVAwesome!\u000a\u000aAnd how do I go about getting some flair? I'm starting to get nostalgic about Office Space now hahaha
p7790
aVUnder the subscribe button there's a thing that says select your flair, and then there's heaps to choose from, no car bomb though sorry ahah 
p7791
aVHmm, should I go for Dillinger, Between the Buried and Me, The Human Abstract, the Browning, or, nevermind, I settled on one.\u000a\u000aWas surprised to see Lamb of God. Seeing Atreyu made me nostalgic.\u000a\u000aI didn't want to go too obvious with All That Remains or Killswitch, though those are some of my first metalcore bands.
p7792
aVI've never listened to within ruins before, to be honest you may listen to more metalcore than I haha
p7793
aVTo be honest they are more Deathcore, and haha, I don't know. I know of a handful of metalcore bands that I listen to periodically, but not as often anymore as say melodeath or now deathgrindish stuff.\u000a\u000aI have accumulated a pretty decent collection though, if I may say so. My brother keeps recommending bands to me, we both do, but he is where I find out about most metalcore or deathcore. Like Within the Ruins, actually. He bought some albums, and then handed me one, and I really liked it hahaha. I keep trying to get him into grindcore, but, aside from a few bands, I don't think he's as into it yet. Some day
p7794
aVGrindcore takes ages to get into, I only like a few bands and it took me months haha its cool you and your brother share music, I don't really have many friends that like my music my brother hates it haha. I'm generally not too keen on anything death related just growls and those riffs don't do it for me.
p7795
aVYeah, death metal took me a bit too. I still don't like the cookie monster type growls.\u000a\u000aGrindcore for me was one thing that I always said to myself that i'd never listen to. You know, like you say, "that stuffs just to what I want." And then I heard Napalm Death and Caninus, and I was like, "wait, this isn't even that heavy." But I still don't really like stuff like Pig Destroyer that much.\u000a\u000aRecently I got into Cattle Decapitation because of Monolith of Inhumanity. That CD just blew me away. A "Living, Breathing Piece of Defecating Meat," "Dead Set on Suicide," and "Lifestalker" I practically listened to on repeat hahaha.\u000a\u000aOut of the blue, do you happen to like experimental metal, like not necessarily avant garde, but like funky metal?
p7796
aVHmm I'm the opposite with grind I can't touch anything that is more death than hardcore, like what do you think of nails and full of hell? Probably ny two favourite grind. I can't take the vocals of cattle decipation haha\u000a\u000a\u000aYou are going to have link me some man! I haven't heard it before, well I've heard math metal and I enjoy that.
p7797
aVI like that cattle decapitation cd, because it doesn't have the over done growls of their stuff before, and has more shrieks, and interesting cleans.\u000a\u000aI like Nails. I haven't heard much Full of Hell, though.\u000a\u000aYou should check out Maximum the Hormone. They mix funk, punk, pop, doom metal, metalcore, grindcore, and a little bit of Hardcore and Death Metal. They are super fun.\u000a\u000aHere's some links:\u000a\u000a[Yoshu Fukushu](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Yoshu+Fukushu/9154720) is their most recent, and tracks like F, Beauty Killoseum, Unbelievable, Benjo Sandal Dance, and the title track are among some of the best on the CD. Also Tsume Tsume Tsume, Alien, and the 2nd+3rd songs, together.\u000a\u000aThe album Bu-ikikaesu is the one right before Yoshu, and is tied for my favorite. It is hard to find the full album in one place, but some of my favorites from that CD are Zetsubou Billy, Shimi, Akagi, and well, the whole thing is pretty sweet.\u000a\u000aBoth those albums were so good that I imported them at exorbitant prices just to have the music hahaha. Their music before is good too, but these CDs are pretty much perfect. Zetsubou Billy was one of the songs that got me into them, and it is one of my favorite metal songs. Though it isn't just metal. Make sure you at least check that song out.\u000a\u000aAnd then there is Mr. Bungle. Haha, they aren't always metal, but man, they are all around crazy. The CD California is like Doo-wop, surfer rock, ska-ish, and then some times goes into tribal music or thrash. Some of their other stuff is more like switching between genres, usually with some form of non-extreme metal as the staple. They are weird above all else hahaha.\u000a\u000a\u000aBut, Ninjaspy is pretty cool. Like Reggae-ish ska fused with metalcore or deathcore. Any song is a good bet to get a good taste.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd if Ninjaspy is something you're interested in, or just want more Ska-Metal, The Flaming Tsunamis is like very Hardcore punk version of Ska Punk. A lot of screaming there.\u000a\u000aSorry about the dump, but I wanted to pay you back for the suggestions hahahahaha 
p7798
aVI relistened to cattle decapitation and it was actually not really that heavy or harsh haha just what time does, i was talking to my friend and he described Converge to be the harshest vocals and full of hell the heaviest thing i linked him haha "dragged through hell" \u000a\u000aMaxium the Hormone was alright, not my favourite though, Yoshu Fukushu was some of the weirdest stuff ive ever heard... like there was a lot of pop punk in there but then it was super crazy i quite enjoyed it, will listen again and i thought Mr. Bungle was great and it seemed like they influenced system of a down and TDEP quite a bit, don't you think?\u000a\u000aI enjoyed ninjaspy and loved The flaming Tsunamis haha\u000a\u000aThanks dude!
p7799
aVOn the Mr. Bungle influence, actually they have a huge influence on tons of bands, including System and I'm pretty sure DEP. Mike Patton has a lot of other bands that are also super influential on everything from Nirvana, to Tool. Crazy how much of an impact he has made.\u000a\u000aMaximum the Hormone is just insane. Almost all of the songs are comedic, and it is pretty much just 4 long time friends doing what ever they think is fun at the time. Also, the chick is a damn good drummer, and one time she was drumming so much while pregnant that they had to quit the tour after she was bleeding from it. \u000a\u000aI love Ska-metal, I just wish there was more of it. Skindred has some Reggae metal stuff, but they aren't super heavy, and some of their newer stuff is more like alt-metal, so it isn't as interesting or fun.\u000a\u000aNo problem!!!\u000a\u000aAnd Converge is awesome!
p7800
aVYou know Mike Patton did vocals on a DEP ep?  I'm at the heart a punk/hardcore kid so I love faster music so that's why the ska stuff was so good haha
p7801
aVSka is one of my favorite genres! I grew up with it just as much as metal, so that's been a huge part of my life too. And yes, the Mike Patton stuff with DEP was awesome. When Good Dogs do Bad Things is actually one of my favorites of theirs. The beginning part is so batshit insane, and then the rest is brilliant. Such a good one.\u000a\u000aAnd their cover of Aphex Twin's Come to Daddy is spot on. It was like a huge chunk of my favorite artists all represented in one song hahaha.

aVHard call. Black Minute, The Bad Thing, Stranger Things... Just too much to handle. Album is incredible
p7812
aVI agree, so many good songs on both albums. I think what really makes the song my favorite is what /u/immortalis said, the Alpha chorus coming in at the very end gives me goosebumps everytime.

aVCreatures was good but I prefer Infamous and Reincarnate. Though I hope on their next album they use more keyboard playing cause Josh is the shit at it! 
p7891
aVThis is a song I thing is perfect all around. Lyrics are fun to sing and easy but have lots of meaning alluding to the crucible. Guitar is really fun to play. Breakdowns are super on point and keep it interesting while not trying to sound too different.

aVSorry, what album are we talking about? Also, what makes Adam D a good producer? I know like nothing about this stuff.
p7940
aVTheir 2009 album (self titled) was only co-produced by Adam. Their style was a bit different and didn't quite feel like a Killswitch album. Adam is part of the band and the fact that he's also their producer really adds to the outcome. They have a distinct style. Also, they typically avoid performing anything from that particular album now that they have another album out.

aVDude, don't base your musical tastes off what other people think, especially those around here. I'm not sure why you are concerned about having a "well-developed musical taste", whatever that is.

aVSeriously though, it was music like this that got me into Metalcore in the first place.\u000a\u000aI really like the interplay between clean vocals and harsh ones. Sorry to beg for recs, but do you have any suggestions for bands like that?
p7959
aVWell, I'd suggest a lot of the bands they're currently on tour with, Miss May I, Northlane, and Fit For a King. August Burns Red doesn't have any cleans, but they're still a great band, and they have some really nice melodic riffs. Also definitely check out Architects, especially their album Daybreaker if you like great cleans
p7960
aVThanks, I'll look them up.
p7961
aVSounds good, hope you like them!
p7962
aVSilent Planet is really similar to Erra too
p7963
aVThank you! Never heard of them before, I'm halfway through Augment and I think I'm in love.
p7964
aVGreat!
p7965
aVI don't like breakdowns, I think you'll be just fine liking whiny vocals. 
p7966
aV&gt; I don't like breakdowns\u000a\u000aBlasphemy.
p7967
aV....okay... fine... there are some breakdowns I like. 
p7968
aVI was just kidding but almost every one that likes metalcore will like at least one breakdown
p7969
aVI can definitely think of a few I like. 
p7970
aVDo you dig the "we'rewolf" one by ETID
p7971
aVI just relistened to it and didn't hear a breakdown. So, I guess so? I know I loved every second of the song. 
p7972
aVWell I'm not sure if you can call it a breakdown but I was meaning when that awesome riff happens at the end but at the same time it makes me want to mosh haha its such an epic fun song
p7973
aVIt is a great song. \u000a\u000aBut if you want an example of a breakdown I do like, listen to In Coalesce With Filth and Faith by Carnifex, that's my favorite one. 
p7974
aVNot the biggest deathcore fan or of those types of breakdown but its better than the breakdowns at every chorus that are slow as fuck 
p7975
aVHm. With that breakdown, it's the kick drums hitting behind the chugs that makes me like it. Angels Shall Shall Sin, Demons Shall Pray by Chelsea Grin is another one like that.  For a metalcore breakdown try Suffocating Sight by Trivium, Defender by As I Lay Dying, or  Indictment by All That Remains. \u000a\u000aAlso Beaten in Lips by Beartooth. 
p7976
aVI'm not the biggest metalcore fan either, mathcore and hardcore is where I'm at. Though thanks for them, will get around to jaming to all those breakdowns
p7977
aVI usually go with the normal life advice for this kinda stuff. People like what they like, and some people don't. I like AA, alot of people don't. Should that cause me to dislike them? Not at all, you like who you like.
p7978
aVWhiny high vocals can get a bit much to be honest. My experience is listen to what you want and if you like it continue to listen to it. However be careful what you mention around here, people get mad when you say things like Sworn In, or Black Veil Brides.
p7979
aVI love Sworn in. Wearing a Sworn In hoodie right now haha
p7980
aVIf you like a band it really shouldn't matter what other people think about it. Musical taste is thankfully subjective. \u000a\u000aAlso, from my experiences there are bands with high pitched, "whiny" vocals that are pretty well liked here. Bands like blessthefall and I See Stars usually get a lot of upvotes. Which bands are you talking about in particular?
p7981
aVThis thread was inspired from a friend recently showing me a song by A Skylit Drive (specifically, *Rise*) which I thought sounded good. Nothing I hadn't heard before, but I liked it. But then another guy told me "Oh that band is complete shit dude, don't listen to them".\u000a
p7982
aVASD are pretty good, especially their old stuff. They are generally considered post-hardcore though.
p7983
aV&gt;ASD are pretty good\u000a\u000aOh...\u000a\u000aI just assumed that this sub would hate them. Yay, I can like them now! I've heard them referred to as "Melodic Metalcore" as well as Post-Hardcore, though. These subgenres are confusing.\u000a\u000aAnd yeah, Post-Hardcore is the other genre I'm thinking of getting into, mainly because for the longest time I've been listening to this Japanese band called Foreground Eclipse which is PHC. Eventually, I was just "I should listen to more bands like this" so I started searching and then started getting interested in Metalcore.
p7984
aVThis sub is not some elitist group of heavy loving music, clean vocals on the whole are loved here, I'm not the biggest fan but some bands do it well as. 
p7985
aVYou a Touhou fan? Foreground Eclipse got me into the fandom a few years ago.
p7986
aVYeah, FE was was like the only metal band I listened to for a while, then I was like "Shit, I should look up more bands like this" so I started looking and well...here I am.
p7987
aVHigh five brotha. If you haven't heard of them, check out [Draw the Emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMafB3gqwwU) and [Crow'sclaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8lmsQ_Ugds). Lots of excellent Touhou rock and metal bands out there. 
p7988
aVAdelphia by ASD is one of my top 10 albums. \u000a\u000aEDIT: PS - check out Bury Tomorrow if you like cleans that aren't whiny. Specifically 'These woods aren't safe for us' 'Her bones in the Sand' and 'You and I' 
p7989
aVI used to loveeeee ASD. I even loved "Infinity on Fire" which always gets shat on. But I don't care for the new record as much, I just think its boring. But "Adelphia" and "Wires" are just mind-blowing records. 
p7990
aVHow about you just like what you like and not give a fuck what anyone says? For real. Fuck everyone else.
p7991
aVFuck what the subreddit says. Listen to what you think sounds good and your taste will eventually evolve to what most of the subreddit says. Trust me, its exactly what happened to me.
p7992
aVIf you like high vocals then try some Saosin, Tides of Man, Circa Survive, and the newer Dance Gavin Dance stuff. It's more posthardcore than metalcore but I think you'll like it.
p7993
aVIt is, and you should feel bad. That aside, just listen to what you like... even if everyone hates it.
p7994
aV&gt;It is, and you should feel bad.\u000a\u000aThis is literally the exact kind of shit I was talking about.\u000a\u000a&gt;even if everyone hates it.\u000a\u000aBut this is nonsense. If everyone else hates something, then it's probably shit, so you shouldn't listen to it. \u000a\u000aLiking shitty things is a sign of bad taste, and who the fuck wants to have bad taste?
p7995
aV&gt;Liking shitty things is a sign of bad taste, and who the fuck wants to have bad taste?\u000a\u000aBad taste doesn't exist. Music is 100% subjective. 
p7996
aVBe yourself. Don't base your concept of "good taste" on other people. Like 75% of the population listen to "poppy radio shit", why don't you base your good taste off them?
p7997
aVTrue... but if you can't help but like shit music, what can you do? You could force yourself to listen to what everyone deems "good music" and see if it will grow on you. \u000aPersonally, I usually double back every 2 years or so and listen to bands(not just metalcore) I didn't like at first or didn't understand the appeal. My music tastes evolve enough for me to find the enjoyment in the music that I previously didn't get understand.\u000aAnd if you seriously want to have better music tastes... that's your own journey to go through and discover.
p7998
aV&gt;You could force yourself to listen to what everyone deems "good music" and see if it will grow on you.\u000a\u000aUh...I'm not forcing myself. I often end up liking both what is considered "bad" music and "good" music, that's the thing. Honestly, most of the time, I can find *something* good in almost any song, because I just listen to songs, instead of endlessly yelling about what is good and what isn't. \u000a\u000aI have pretty good music tastes already. It's just that unlike most, I only care about whether the song sounds good. I could care less who made it or what genre it's in or whatever. I have my genre preferences but I wont write off a song just because it's in a particular genre (unless it's poppy radio shit, that stuff just sucks in general).
p7999
aV... then why are we even having this conversation? It seemed to me that you were worried that people would judge you because you like a certain type of metalcore.
p8000
aVBecause as much as I hate to admit it, people will judge you depending on your tastes in music?\u000a\u000aI mean, I don't really care what people think, but it's still very annoying when someone endlessly shits all over stuff you like.
p8001
aV&gt;Because as much as I hate to admit it, people will judge you depending on your tastes in music?\u000a\u000aChildren, maybe. \u000a\u000aNo grown ass adult gives a fuck about your taste enough to give you shit.\u000a\u000aPeople don't like your taste? Fuck 'em. They're petty and worthless. \u000a\u000a&gt;I mean, I don't really care what people think, but it's still very annoying when someone endlessly shits all over stuff you like.\u000a\u000aTell them to kiss your ass and fuck off. There's no point wasting your time on people that petty and immature. 
p8002
aVYep, but that's kind of what the Internet is known for at this point. Its pretty much unavoidable.
p8003
aVSo you're saying la dispute is shit? As they have whinny vocals
p8004
aVI guess so...? I've never seriously gave them a listen. But if it has the vocals, I don't know if I'll be able to stomach it.
p8005
aVWell they are generally you love them or hate them, they are very very highly critically acclaimed just saying. 
p8006
aValright... well give me a song...
p8007
aVWell you can't judge them off a song you have to listen to like the whole album, just try Wildlife and don't judge it on vocals they are growers. For specific songs you could try Edward Benz 27 times, Said the King to the river, Hudsonville MI and he is here he is not afraid this is a song from each album
p8008
aV&gt;Well you can't judge them off a song you have to listen to like the whole album\u000a\u000aIf I honestly can't get into any of the songs, I'm not gonna force myself to listen to a whole album just to know if I like them or not. I get them or I don't.
p8009
aV&gt; Edward Benz 27 times\u000a\u000aAlso, this sounds like a Fugazi song.
p8010
aVJust listen to the songs I suggested, its in a way you listen to Jane Doe from Converge 
p8011
aVAre you asking if I have listened to the song Jane Doe by Converge?
p8012
aVNo the album, everyone says just listen to that album you know?
p8013
aVI guess, i always thought that album had a bunch of fillers on it, but that is a whole another argument.
p8014
aVI find that album to be near perfect personally 
p8015
aVI can't speak for you, but a perfect album is not rare for me. I counted at least 26 albums I love beginning to end. So a perfect album isn't as big of a deal to me as it is for others. And that said... I'm still very picky for some reason.
p8016
aVI'm picky as too, like I hardly like cleans, chugs and a lot of breakdowns and growls. To me a perfect album is more than just a collection of songs, just my idea but we are all different 
p8017
aVYep, I'm slowly teaching myself to not "flip my shit" everytime someone doesn't like music I like.
p8018
aVIf i can take a guess i'd say you listen to deathcore?
p8019
aVHaha, no. I mean I listen to a couple deathcore bands, but it's mostly alternative rock.
p8020
aVAnd the vocals I think he was referring to are the pre-pubescent high whiny vocals. 
p8021
aVI straight up hate those vocals just saying but thats just my opinion, I don't mind whiny vocals in the form of emo and La Dispute
p8022
aVI do too. so when you started talking about La Dispute, I thought you were talking about the little boy high vocals.
p8023
aVOh nah it just sounds almost like he's whinning haha he doesn't sing or scream its weird
p8024
aVSounds fine to me, I'm not by any means a fan. But I could listen to it, I just didn't get into it... didn't really wow me.
p8025
aVHorses for courses.
p8026
asVWe are I The Breather, Ask Us Anything!
p8027
(lp8028
VHow do you guys feel about atheistic lyrics like in BMTH and Motionless in White? Do you think it's fine and just an expression of their beliefs or do you have a problem with them?\u000a\u000aAlso, do you think Spotify/YouTube is good for the music industry or bad?
p8029
aVThey aren't a Christian band anymore
p8030
aVFuck
p8031
aVStill, I think its a pretty good question. 
p8032
aV\u005c&gt;tfw ignored
p8033
aV\u005c _(\u30c4)_/
p8034
aVWould you ever consider touring with a band called attila in the future?
p8035
aVWe'd love to!\u000a\u000aConor
p8036
aVWhat about Verb The Noun?
p8037
aVDo you still consider yourselves a Christian metalcore band?
p8038
aVWere just a ground of dudes who want to inspire people through our music. I wouldn't consider it a Christian band but we do have Christian like influence in some of our music. I feel like narrowing us to open particular category pulls away from all the other subjects we touch on. -Shawn
p8039
aVHow do you feel about the comparisons you get to August Burns Red regarding your sound?
p8040
aVI personally love it because I've always loved that band. Definitely not ashamed of the comparison, makes me think we're doing something right! -Aaron
p8041
aVI dont personally think our newer stuff is abr like but as far as T&amp;amp;P/TAMS go, they were very metal core influenced so you will hear similarities. -Shawn
p8042
aV[deleted]
p8043
aVI ask the hard hitting questions. 
p8044
aV[deleted]
p8045
aVgod i hate these kind of gifs
p8046
aV[deleted]
p8047
aVI feel like TAMS is the only one slightly similar to Messengers ABR. 
p8048
aVI just wanted to ask since I've always felt like I The Breather and Texas In July sounded like they were **heavily** influenced by Messengers era August Burns Red.
p8049
aVTruuuu
p8050
aVFor a band of your level, what is the financial situation/outlook like? I don't want specifics since that would obviously be rude/a breach of contract for you guys most likely, but are you guys able to live off of tour income in between tours or do you have jobs back at home? I know the big bands like MMF, BMTH, etc can live off their income pretty well, but I'm more curious what it's like for mid-level bands like you guys. 
p8051
aVWhat is your favorite food? If you added rice to it what rating would you give it out of 10? 
p8052
aVMexican food/sushi - both of which contain rice so yes 10/10\u000a\u000aConor
p8053
aVSteak with sauted onions and mushrooms made by my dad..rice with steak? Nahhhhh -Aaron
p8054
aVShawn, you're a cool ass dude, and so is your hair. How do you do it?
p8055
aVhis hair is a cool ass dude?
p8056
aVYes
p8057
aVI use a product called Uppercut. Thanks haha 
p8058
aVare you 100% happy with your latest record? If not, what's one major change you'd like to make?
p8059
aVI absolutely love it, I'm sure there's things that we could've made differently, but I love how it turned out and wouldn't change it -Aaron
p8060
aVBy far my favorite album we've written as a band -Shawn 
p8061
aVI think we'd all say we're more satisfied with Life Reaper than any album we've put out, but there are some things I'd change. I wish the message of the songs was clearer, some of the choruses were a little different, and I wish the record in general was more dynamic. But that's what the best album's for!\u000a\u000aConor
p8062
aVWhen do you reckon you make your way back to Australia? It was rad seeing you guys here in 2013 :)
p8063
aVWe'd absolutely love to be back! Tell your local promoters to speed up the process \U0001f609\u000a\u000aConor
p8064
aVNo questions really, but thanks for being one of the only bands that's coming to western Massachusetts, I'll see you guys March 12th!
p8065
aVSounds awesome man!! Thanks for listening -Aaron
p8066
aVSee you there!\u000a\u000aConor
p8067
aVwhat are some of your biggest influences? has that changed much since your first album?\u000a\u000aalso, who came up with the band's name and what exactly does it mean?
p8068
aVSome of my biggest influences (bands) would definitely be Foo Fighters, August Burns Red, Slipknot, Deftones and many more. (musicians) Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Matt Greiner, Adam Gray, Chris Coleman and Benny Greb -Aaron
p8069
aVIt's cool to see so many metalcore bands with Deftones influences. 
p8070
aVWhat's the weirdest thing to happen to you guys on tour?
p8071
aVThis is tough - we've seen A LOT of weird things generally involving people who are EXTREMELY high/drunk\u000a\u000aConor
p8072
aVWhat's the MOST RECENT weird thing you've seen on tour involving an extremely high/drunk person?
p8073
aVIn the metal realm, and just in general, who do you guys really like listening to lately? 
p8074
aVLately for me it's been the new Title Fight album "Hyperview" and the new Turnstile album "Nonstop Feeling" -Aaron
p8075
aVI just earned a ton more respect for you guys for listen to those bands. sick.
p8076
aVHey guys, big fan here after I saw you at Warped for the first time. What venue would you consider your holy grail to play at? (Even if you haven't played there yet) \u000aAlso, if each of you could be any animal, what would it be and why is it a penguin?\u000aPenguins are cool.
p8077
aVWe played Blossom Music Center in Ohio and that was certainly a fantastic experience because I remember watching a lot of my favorite bands perform there when I was younger. \u000a\u000aAs much as I love penguins, I believe my spirit animal would definitely have to be an elephant hahahah \u000a-Aaron
p8078
aVThat's awesome that you guys enjoyed Blossom! Saw you guys there this past year and you signed some stuff for me. Great group of guys and great music!
p8079
aVNortheast Ohio FTW!
p8080
aVAfter being too multiple Pittsburgh warped tours, and one at Blossom, Id say blossom blew Pittsburgh outta the water! The atmosphere is so much better
p8081
aVHow do you think of the acceptance of faith in the metalcore (and metal) community and industry? did anybody ever do you wrong because of your faith?
p8082
aV[deleted]
p8083
aVRegarding the whole band:\u000aWhat is your favourite breakdown to play?
p8084
aVSoul : Seek, for sure -Aaron
p8085
aVAh! Awesome! Such a sick breakdown! I love it! =D Thank you so much for the reply Aaron! =D
p8086
aVNo, way that happens to be my favorite breakdown of yours.
p8087
aVSoul:Seek and a High Rise\u000a\u000aConor
p8088
aVAh! Awesome! Soul:Seek is SO sick, and I just finished listening to High Rise for the first time, and I'm listening to it right now! The breakdown near the end of the song is SO sick! =D Thank you SO much for the reply Conor! =D
p8089
aVWhich song are you most proud of, and why?\u000a\u000aMy personal favourite of yours is 04.12.11, hands down. 
p8090
aVShape : Shifter because it's emotional, groovy and catchy -Aaron
p8091
aVFavorite band you've ever toured with?
p8092
aVits always a party whenever Born of Osiris is around so I'd have to say those guys\u000a\u000a-Kyle
p8093
aVBorn of Osiris (as people); SLIPKNOT (as one of the biggest bands on earth)\u000a\u000aConor
p8094
aVBad Rabbits on Warped Tour -Aaron
p8095
aVSylar - the band is sick!!! -Shawn
p8096
aVWhat is the biggest influence on your band?
p8097
aVWhere does your band name originate from?
p8098
aV[deleted]
p8099
aVHigh Rise, Forgiven, False Prophet, Setting : Sun and Soul : Seek -Aaron
p8100
aVMy exact list, but I'd also ad Chain: Breaker 
p8101
aVI'd put Conquer on there somewhere. I don't know what to take out, but Conquer needs to be on that list.
p8102
aVIt's hard for me to say without knowing what bands are your favorites so I'll say Swine:Cult, Shape:Shifter, Lunar, Mentalist, and Setting:Sun show the widest scope of our music.
p8103
aV[deleted]
p8104
aVDo you prefer hardcore dancing or push moshing?
p8105

aVAs someone who has yet to get into your music, how would you describe your sound? Why should I give you guys a listen (not to say I won't, I just wanna know what makes you guys special)?
p8126
aVEmotionally-driven, technical and groovy. I'd say listen to us because there's nothing out right now that really sounds like us. Our new album Life Reaper is a banger -Aaron
p8127
aVAwesome, thanks for the reply. I'll definitely check you guys out!

aVHey, ITB! How have band practices changed after replacing so many members?
p8147
aVWe all live in different parts of the country so we have 1 rehearsal before tour. -Shawn
p8148
aVWow that is impressive. How common do you see this in other bands you've all toured with? Also, what are your experiences between playing with best friends you've grown up with compared to playing with dudes from all around the country?
p8149
aVWhat's it like touring with ABR and Silverstein? I remember first seeing y'all at that tour back in 2012!
p8150
aVWhat is the process like for getting tours together/scheduling dates and venues for shows?
p8151

p8155

aVMy solar system half sleeve -Aaron
p8161
aVDo any of you guys ever get a little bummed out when you are playing a small show and the crowd is absolutely dead? 
p8162
aVNot really! You'll have those shows, it's a part of being in a touring band. Some cities are great, some not so great. We're still playing our music and showing our passion to others, regardless the size of the crowd -Aaron
p8163
aVNot as long as the kids that are there are excited! Those shows can be a blast. Every band experiences it or has at one point, so it's best to make the best of it.
p8164
aVI started listening to you guys a few months ago and haven't stopped since. What do you guys like to do in your free time on tour? 
p8165
aVWe love hanging out with the other bands, trying food from everywhere, and wasting time on our phones\u000a\u000aConor
p8166
aVFor sure. hope to see you guys soon.\u000a\u000aThanks!
p8167
aVYo guys!\u000a\u000aI had the pleasure of seeing you dudes at warped tour (PNC, NJ) and me and my girlfriend somehow got lucky enough to snag some VIP passes for your set thru a vendor. You guys killed it, and Shawn was super cool! \u000a\u000aI have a couple of questions for you guys- \u000a\u000a- What do you guys like to do in your leisure time on tour, if there is any?\u000a\u000a- Do you guys have a favorite song to play together live?\u000a\u000aAnd for Shawn-\u000a\u000a- How do you expect things to change when the baby comes around? (Congrats, dude!)
p8168
aVThanks so much! I personally spend far too much time eating and playing games on my phone. I also enjoy reading.\u000a\u000aMy favorite songs to play live are Life:Reaper, Swine:Cult, and Shape:Shifter\u000a\u000aConor

p8177
aVHow to you guys actually create a song? I've always been fascinated by the process. Do you just start off with a guitar riff and work from there? Thanks so much, love everything you guys do!
p8178
aVGenerally yes - we'll start with a main riff and build around it. In the future Id like to start by writing choruses first\u000a\u000a- Conor
p8179
aVKyle,what kind of advice would you give a fellow guitarist who feels stagnant in his playing? What is your way of always progressing and bettering your playing?
p8180
aVHey ITB, going back to the old school, what was it like recording with that faggot Durv? \u000aKidding. Not a serious question.\u000a\u000aBest studio story? I still think the singing ruled on the first album. \u000aThanks ITb

aVI love you guys and your music. That is all.
p8184
aVMight seem like a dick question, but when I the Breather ceases to be, what are your backup plans for the rest of your lives? Will you guys stay involved in music in some way, or get regular jackoff jobs? \u000a\u000aPersonally hoping you guys continue to pursue music long after Breather has run its course.

aV^\u000a\u000aI told them to post it early to gather questions/let the best questions bubble up to the top via the upvote and downvote system.

p8194
asVPlease take the time to sign this petition about facebook charging money to bands for reaching "fans" they have already acquired. More info inside.
p8195
(lp8196
VWhile I agree with the point of the petition - there's nothing anyone can do? It's just part of facebook's business model.
p8197
aVThey used to have options to pay for promotions and advertising on other pages/other people's feeds. Let's say I listen to Northlane, and Invent, Animate wants to promote to people who listen to Northlane, there used to be a fee you could pay to get promoted on Northlane's page as well as on the "things you might like" section for people who liked Northlane. Now its not only that, but if you want your posts to show up (for people who have already liked your page) on people's feeds, you have to pay money for access to that. They already liked the page, they already subscribed interest in your material. Bands shouldn't have to pay to reach those people. You don't pay for your friends to see your status updates on how br00tal the new Falling In Reverse album is. So why does The Browning need to pay for their Facebook fans to see that they've booked a new tour? 
p8198
aVI agree you shouldn't have to pay to reach your fans, but the fact is that you're still on Facebook's site. They can do whatever they want in terms of charging people and trying to make them change policies on the grounds of ethics wouldn't hold any weight.
p8199
aVI mean, to an extent. Companies should do whatever they want, regardless of how they treat their users? Ethics should play a role in how you run your company. 
p8200
aVIn general if users feel like they are being treated badly then they will simply move to another site/company. Unfortunately there is no other site (except for maybe twitter) so they are forced to pay. Sure it's unethical but there is a market for it and some bands seem to be willing to pay - so from their point of view why should they stop?
p8201
aVIt wasn't until recently and correct me if I'm wrong but they were doing more than fine without this.
p8202
aVThey're also a business, and businesses try to make money. This is why I wish MySpace were still relevant.
p8203
aVIt's been one 2 years I want to say. \u000a\u000aAnd they are a public company, what do you expect them to do?\u000a\u000aEdit: Spelling on mobile when for first wake up. 
p8204
aVGo home your drunk
p8205
aVFor people who run bandpages, paying money to facebook so people can actually see what you post on on your page pretty much costs more than you would ever make playing a show now for local bands. On top of buying gear, rehearsal rooms, petrol (gas), advertising and taking time off work for shows it is next to impossible for new bands to make an impact anywhere without investing a fuck ton of money as it is, the last thing any one needs are these ludicrous fees (that we already pay) added on top.
p8206
aVThis is a nice sentiment, but it will literally accomplish nothing.
p8207
aVNot with that attitude!
p8208
aVAttitude doesn't change factual reality.
p8209
aVAttitude opens up opportunity.
p8210
aVI 100% guarantee you that this petition will not do a single thing, and that's just the way it is. 21,000 people have signed this, which seems like a good number. But when over 500,000,000 people are using facebook, this is nothing and will do nothing.
p8211
aVI never said it would, but the more people that realise what is going on the better.
p8212
aVGood attitude
p8213
aVIt's just being realistic.
p8214

Thanks for sharing this dude, I hope it leads to a change.
p8217
aVIt's great that people are this supportive of their favourite bands, but frankly, petitions like this one won't help a lot. The people at Facebook probably  know that there are many who don't like it, but it's just how they operate.
p8218
aVWell if there is one thing I've learned its that every one here is a bunch of push overs
p8219
aVI do agree with this in spirit but Facebook had to make money somehow. You knew this was coming when you signed to for an account FOR FREE. \u000a\u000aYou have other options. Twitter, MySpace, Google Plus etc. Use them if you don't like Facebook. 
p8220
aVWould be an option if any one actually paid attention to them.\u000a\u000aThey make their money off adverts. That is totally cool, and I respect that. But charging kids who don't even make any money so people actually know they exist? That's shitty.\u000a\u000aGiant acts like Kanye West and who ever the fuck with millions of dollars behind them are subject to the same rules as some 15 year old kids playing in their dads garage on some 10 watt marshals. It doesn't make sense. They have forced them selves into our lives and now are expecting us to pay for it.
p8221
aVI have a bandpage &amp; want to sign. But I'm not about to give change.org my house address or my e-mail.\u000a\u000aYou want to talk about unnecessary, then why do they my mailing address? Facebook doesn't ask for your address..

p8263
aVHoly fuck that was awesome. First time actually listening to these guys.\u000a\u000aEARTH WALKERS - WILL NEVER ddiiiIIIEEE 
p8264
aVI love all of their songs.. usually I dislike at least a couple songs from someone, but these guys are just great..
p8265
aVI loved their last album, Divination, but I feel like the production just fell through on this one. Can't get into it.
p8266
aVDon't know why you got downvoted...I think the production is just different. Divination was gritty and agressive. This was more polished and clean Different sounds, but I enjoyed Divination more.\u000a\u000aEdit: In addition, I think the guitar work reflects this perfectly. The chug patterns/riffs in Divination are way more technical, aggressive and djent-y. As a guitar player, I hear some of the patterns on that album and I'm like "Nopeee" but on Earthwalker, they're similar (for the most part) and not as djent-y. I'm not as scared to try and play along with those songs. Also the tone on them is cleaner, making the leads more prominent. So instead of this crushing your skull in feel driven by heavy riffs and chugs, you get this more dreamy/atmospheric feel led by leads and synthy stuff.  
p8267
aVYou nailed it.  \u000a\u000aWith Divination, IHW were a young, unsigned band.  I wanted to capture that raw energy and live sound.  With Earthwalker/Skydancer, I wanted the production to reflect their maturity as individuals and songwriters.  If you go back and watch the old videos, they're produced the same way.  Wait until you see "Breakaway"... some of the highest production you'll ever see in a metalcore video.
p8268
aVThat last sentence has me so amped!! I thought "Divination" was a spectacular video...so I can't wait to see what "Breakaway" holds!!

aVMy thoughts exactly. I was really missing that sound with Structures subsequent release. These guys are definitely one of my favorite new things to listen to.

aVSame. I actually won tickets to the show, too. I listened to ADTR a lot and tried to get into PTV before seeing them live.  I didn't like PTV at all until seeing their live show, and WCAR tore it up too. I instantly got their first album after I went home.  This was probably one of my favorite shows ever, all genres included.
p8310
aVI'm guessing I'm the oldest one here. It's hard to remember exactly what my first metalcore show was, but one of my first ones has to be back in 1996 or 1997. I saw Living Sacrifice, Jesus Freaks, and Elliott (who changed their name to Eso-Charis...Corey from Norma Jean was the vocalist) down in Nashville at Rocketown. 
p8311
aVNot counting Warped tour, it was August Burns Red, Blessthefall, Defeater, and Beartooth in fall 2013. Still one of the best shows I've been at\u000a\u000aEdit: Before that, I did go to Warped tour in 2012 and 2013 though
p8312
aVDid you have that awkward "I don't know what to do with myself" moment your first time in the pit? 
p8313
aVNot really, since the first pit I was in was I See Stars' pit at Warped tour, and it wasn't too crazy, just a lot of people jumping, so I just went along with that and it was pretty fun, then later that night I went into ABR's pit, and that was a bit crazier, but still really fun
p8314
aVAhh lol first thing I encountered was a wall of death to 2012 by TWA....
p8315
aVAh, yeah, that would be an interesting first pit experience
p8316
aVFirst pit I was ever in was I See Stars at Warped Tour aswell. Fucking love ISS.

p8318
aVSame dude! Such a good show. 
p8319
aVABR in 2012 was my first warped tour/metal core show\u000aAnd since they were my favorite band I went into the pit, sadly as soon as I got in I got elbowed in the nose and started bleeding like crazy and had to sit it out. \u000a\u000aStill the best show I've ever been to. 
p8320
aVThey had some crazy tours in 2012, sadly I didn't really get into them until 2013
p8321
aVThey did. I've seen them every year except last because they didn't come to my state last year and it only gets better
p8322
aVI got into them a little before Rescue &amp; Restore came out, and I've been to a show on every US tour they've done since then, even though I had to go out to Pennsylvania for their summer mini-headliner, since it went nowhere near where I live (Massachusetts), but since it was the middle of summer, I thought a road trip would be a good idea, and it ended up being a great show and definitely worth it
p8323
aVSaw them minus Beartooth later that tour.  I was really disappointed that Beartooth wasn't opening, but Blessthefall and ABR were both awesome.  That was my second show, with the first being letlive, Texas In July, Silverstein, and ABR in winter 2012.
p8324
aVJeez I feel old here reading most of the comments... \u000aMy first was maybe 2003-2004ish, Norma Jean headlined with The Agony Scene, The Beloved, and Figure Four. Just about the time that "Bless The Martyr and Kiss the Child" had been released. Shit was absolutely crazy.
p8325
aVSame beloved that made death to traitors?

p8327
aVahh okay yea that song was so good, unfortunately the only song I know from them. Can you recommend another one?

I'm on my phone so lmk if this doesn't work but their first release, [The Running,](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDB0E89026043798C) is an awesome listen. Their second album, [Failure On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RisQon7og1I&amp;list=PL0ivlkG7Rj556lm8MiKIEsfyToNGHGrMK) is my personal favorite, also the album that has the song you mentioned.

aVIt was pretty sick. It got me into a lot lc those bands, because I was just starting to really listen to these genres. 
p8337
aVSad to say? AA was good in 2010
p8338
aVI wouldn't say good, but I did enjoy them at the time. Not so much anymore. 
p8339
aVDead Throne Tour in Australia 2011 it had The Devil Wears Prada, We Came As Romans, and Dream On Dreamer.
p8340
aVNot necessarily Metalcore but I saw Insomnium and Dark Tranquility back in January. However I did see Dillinger open for Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails in August last year. I dont know if that counts :/\u000a\u000a
p8341
aVMine was the Dead Throne tour with TDWP, Whitechapel, Enter Shikari, and For Today. It's still one of the best shows I've ever seen 
p8342
aVSounds like it hot damn 
p8343
aVI still resent the fact that that tour never came near me, because TDWP with Whitechapel sounds unreal.
p8344
aVI saw Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, DevilDriver, and Soilwork back in 2007. It was on the anniversary of Dimebag's death, so at the end of the show they all came out and played 5 Minutes Alone by Pantera! That set the bar pretty high for my first metal show! [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVFH5uK0Jhg) a video of them performing it. 
p8345
aVWent to see BFMV with Atreyu and Bring Me in 2009. It was a great show. 
p8346
aVSeeing as I'm from Ocala, Florida, my first show was A Day to Remember and Underoath back when they were still more of local bands. 
p8347
aV2011 with A Day To Remember, August Burns Red,The Ghost Inside and Living With Lions
p8348
aVReally wish I could've gone to that tour, sadly it was in Europe and I wasn't even into this genre at the time
p8349
aVWe Came As Romans in London Ontario September 2012. Abandon all Ships and Ice Nine Kill opened.\u000a\u000aThe room was pretty empty. The 'pit' was two guys fighting invisible ninjas, the rest of the crowed was pretty docile. Probably the worst crowd I've been in. WCAR still had a great performance though.
p8350
aVsaw this show in st kitts without ice nine....crowd was good bands were mucho meh
p8351
aVBack in I think 2009 I saw The Devil Wears Prada, A Day to Remember, Sky Eats Airplane and Emarosa and it was the first metalcore show I have ever been too. Blew my mind. Right before Roots came out so the setlist was basically Plagues, a few songs off of Dear Love and a few new ones off Roots.
p8352
aVMy first (and only) metalcore show was in January 2012. Metalcore bands rarely ever play here in Norway, and I'm not much of a concert goer anyway. But I decided to drag my friends along for a weekend trip to London.   The show was Asking Alexandria, blessthefall, Chelsea Grin and With One Last Breath. We ended up missing WOLB and CG because the queue was damn long, so we waited with some beers in the pub nearby. I met Eric from btf at the bar, and probably made a fool of myself (drunk). Both blessthefall and Asking Alexandria put on a great show, though I'd say btf were better performers. All in all a great show, and even my friends who aren't really into metalcore had a good time.
p8353
aVdepends what counts...\u000a\u000aWarped Tour 2004 10th Anniversary show in Boston, Avenged Sevenfold played, still using the harsh vocals.  Blew my mind as I was really into those guys.\u000a\u000aOct 25, 2005 - Avenged Sevenfold City of Evil headliner at The Palladium in Worcester, MA.  They played M.I.A., Wicked End, Strength of the World.  First of a plethora of shows I've attended at that venue...and that count has grown every year by a handful.\u000a\u000aMar 10, 2006 - Haste The Day, Bleeding Through, Between the Buried and Me, and Every Time I Die show at The Palladium.
p8354
aVI saw Of Mice &amp; Men on their first headliner.  They were with ISMFOF, Woe, Is Me, Sleeping with Sirens, and The Amity Affliction.  It was pretty awesome.
p8355
aVI was at that too! Fucking amazing show. Mine was in Chicago. 
p8356
aVThe Devil Wears Prada, ADTR, Emarosa and Sky Eats Airplane back in May(?) of 2009 I believe. The Pulling Your Pud Tour later that year was a lot better. Even got to meet the entire band before the show, that was amazing. \u000a\u000aEdit: I feel like I'm dating myself with this but the first "show" I actually went to was The Fall of Troy at this piece of shit bar called Saratoga Winners back in 2006. Fuck I'm old. 
p8357
aVAsking Alexandria and Born of Osiris in 2010 at the Rave in Milwaukee. Danny asked for 20 bras on stage before they would play an encore and he ended up getting it. Turns out there was a chick who took off everything except for her panties in the front row and he called her on stage despite the security guards trying to keep her down. She got up there and showed the whole crowd her tits, and then AA started the song. It was fucking crazy and I haven't seen anything like it at the 30+ shows I've been to since. There's a YouTube video of it somewhere, but it's been edited to cut off before that part happens. \u000a\u000aEdit: [Found it](http://youtu.be/zVHKPioyKaw)\u000a\u000aShe was insanely hot. 
p8358
aVwith all that remains I think I went to this in toronto, only for born of osiris, worth it
p8359
aVThe Zombie 5 tour.
p8360
aVYou're in for a treat ;)
p8361
aVI saw Architects and Bring Me The Horizon at Reading in 2011. That's what got me into metalcore. I saw how crazy the crowd was and i just... got it.
p8362
aVWW3 with Hollywood Undead headlining (eww), Asking Alexandria, We Came as Romans, D.R.U.G.S., and Borgore (for whatever reason).\u000a\u000aNovember 2011.
p8363
aVI saw Memphis May Fire a few years back just after they put out Challenger. I was way up front and I distinctly remember being kicked in the head twice by crowd surfers. Needless to say I have gone back for more.
p8364
aVMine was the Haste the Day farewell tour with MyChildren Mybride, The Chariot, and A Plea for Purging. 3/4 bands have broken up now and they are definitely all three in the list of my favorite bands. That was where I fell in love with the genre and started to get into every metalcore ,deathcore, hardcore, or melodic hardcore band known to man.
p8365
aVMy first was in 2011. A Skylit Drive, Animals as Leaders, and Thursday opened for Underoath. It was a phenomenal show!
p8366
aVI think it was Scream it Like You Mean it 2012. The show had Attack Attack!, WCAR, Woe is Me, Abandon All Ships, etc. It was a long ass show. 
p8367
aVArtery foundation tour 2009\u000a\u000aDance Gavin Dance,\u000aA Skylit Drive,\u000aAttack Attack!,\u000aOur Last Night ,\u000aEmarosa.
p8368
aVI don't remember the year exactly but Atreyu was headlining, touring for The Curse. I recall From Autumn to Ashes opening for them, but I can't for the life of me remember who else was on the bill.
p8369
aVI saw Killswitch Engage once, but as far as like modern metalcore type of stuff I guess I guess it would have been Motionless in White/Capture the Crown/Asking Alexandria.  Feel like I'm forgetting someone but can't remember.  
p8370
aVAs I Lay Dying, All that Remains, and Haste the Day back in '07. My friend and I had our parents drive and everything hahah we were like 15. 
p8371
aVKillswitch Engage, Every Time I Die, &amp; Parkway back in 2008. It was fucking awesome! 
p8372
aVTDWP and haste the day on the napalm and noise tour in 2009. What a great fucking show it was as well.
p8373
aVAp Fall Tour 2010 August Burns Red, BMTH, Emarosa (with Johnny Craig), Polar Bear Club and This Is Hell.
p8374
aVLooks like an interesting lineup
p8375
aVIt was awesome. 2012 I believe and it was We Came As Romans, Miss May I, Of Mice &amp; Men, Texas In July, and Close to Home. Easily still the top show I've ever been to. 
p8376
aVAugust Burns Red with Of Mice and Men, The Color Morale, and Overseer at the House Of Blues Anaheim. Sick show, first time throwing down\u000a
p8377
aVGreat tour, really wish I could've done to that one
p8378
aVApril 2009.\u000a\u000aOpener to Closer:\u000a\u000aMunicipal Waste (thrash as fuck and just brilliant live. so much fun.)\u000a\u000aGod Forbid\u000a\u000aChildren of Boredom\u000a\u000aAs I Lay Dying\u000a\u000aLamb of God
p8379
aVBack in '09 I saw ADTR, ABR, Enter Shikari, and Silverstein it was a badass show.
p8380
aVThat's a pretty nice lineup
p8381
aVThe best part was when Enter Shikari threw condoms in the crowd, and said "don't worry we got you covered."
p8382
aVI saw All That Remains open for Hollywood Undead ages ago at my first show ever.\u000a\u000aFirst all-core show was Falling in Reverse, Enter Shikari and letlive.\u000a\u000aFirst *all-metalcore* show was the Break Down the Walls tour early last year. 
p8383
aVThe Break Down the Walls tour was definitely a fun one
p8384
aVWarped your was first festival, but my first show was The Color Morale, For today, The Devil wears prada, and As I Lay Dying. It was so sick.
p8385
aVTransmission Festival back in 2010 I believe. We Came As Romans, ISMFOF, Legend, MyChildren MyBride, and a bunch of other bands just to name a few.\u000a\u000aI think the first metalcore concert I went to though was the Back To The Roots tour with TDWP, Miss May I and Your Demise
p8386
aVFirst show ever for me was:\u000a\u000a* Abandon All Ships\u000a* For All Those Sleeping\u000a* Skip the Foreplay\u000a* Upon This Dawning\u000a* ~~Palisades~~ (couldn't make it to the Little Rock date)\u000a\u000aHere's the [admat](http://www.thearteryfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/552129_10152035702720360_834428766_n.jpeg).
p8387
aVI loved that concert
p8388
aVIt sucks Palisades couldn't make it. But I did see them on the Not Your American Idols tour.
p8389
aVPalisades was at the Richmond, VA stop and I must say they are the nicest guys I've ever met.
p8390
aVI highly agree with this statement.
p8391
aVFirst show was A day to remember's right back at it again tour. It was Them, Of mice &amp; men, and issues. \u000aIt was pretty crowded and I was scared at first but it was quite the experience.\u000aI've been going to a show at least once a month ever since (:
p8392
aVa day to remember
p8393
aVWe Came as Romans and a bunch of local bands. WeCAR and like 2 of the 6 or so other bands were good. Rest was pretty awful. 
p8394
aVI See Stars and Abandon All Ships way back in the day. Fucking awesome time that was
p8395
aVThe Cool Tour with As I Lay Dying. Honestly forgot who else performed. Sick show though
p8396
aVTDWP, The Ghost Inside, Volumes, and Texas In July last year.  
p8397
aVTDWP, ABR, and Miss May I at Summerfest in Milwaukee 
p8398
aVThere was this small band from Denton, TX called Tuesday Aggression that I went to see for my first show. Local band, pretty good too. It was during the MySpace era so that's how I found them. Shame they stopped though I really dig their stuff. Granted they only had like 3-4 songs haha\u000a
p8399
aVHa! I live in Lewisville. 
p8400
aVParkway Drive, I Killed The Prom Queen, Northlane and Survival. 22nd of December 2012 at Festival Hall MLB. 
p8401
aVParkway Drive and The Ghost Inside. There were two other bands that I can't remember. Both The Ghost Inside and Parkway Drive completely blew my mind. The breakdown for Between the Lines at that show is one of, if not the, beat live experiences I've ever had. That shit shook the entire building. 
p8402
aVThis Is A Family Tour (2010)- Attack Attack, Emmure, Pierce the Veil, Of Mice and Men, In Fear and Faith. One for the books right there
p8403
aVJust some local gig, it was average haha
p8404
aVFeeling a bit old but It was parkway drive doing a free show in 2005 or 2006 just before they went on their first American tour. 
p8405
aVOur Last Night, Crown The Empire, Lions Lions, and Palisades in June 2012.
p8406
aVDisarm the Descent Tour with Killswitch Engage, Miss May I, Affiance, Darkest Hour, and The Word Alive.
p8407
aVI saw this gig when it came through Vancouver. Easily one of the best lineups and concerts I've had the privilege of seeing. The return of Jesse was amazing after having seen Howard with the band twice previously. 
p8408
aVYeah i met some of the guys from Affiance. They're pretty chill.
p8409
aVAs did I. Denis walked off stage super nonchalantly and we chatted about what it was like touring at this point in their careers and how they were liking Western Canada. Awesome guy. 
p8410
aVYeah i talked a bit with the guitarists. He was tired after the show but it he was pretty happy for how it went.
p8411
aVHoly shit, I feel old reading these. My first metalcore concert was when I saw Unearth, Killswitch Engage (who were promoting TEOH) and Slipknot (who were promoting Subliminal Verses). This was in 2004 at the PNE Forum in Vancouver, which is a huge barn, essentially. The place was fucking wild as Slipknot was at the top of their stage game at this point. \u000a\u000aSeeing KSE blew me away and led me to discover AOJB. And the rest is history. 
p8412
aVWe Came as Romans in late 2012 in my city! I saw them the summer of 2013 at warped tour as well. Really different shows, one was small and felt more personal cause it was a small venue at the time, and warped was much more energetic cause of the massive crowd.
p8413
aVFreshman year of high school in 03: \u000a\u000a- Fear Before the March of Flames \u000a- Hopesfall\u000a- The Chariot \u000a- Underoath \u000a\u000a@ The Door, Dallas, TX\u000a\u000aEDIT: First concert, not metalcore, also in 03: \u000a\u000a- Coheed and Cambria \u000a- Thrice \u000a- Thursday
p8414
aVProtest The Hero/Architects/Affiance back in November of 2013.
p8415
aVI can't remember what the tour was but it had AA, WCAR, Crown The Empire and someone else I can't even remember. 
p8416
aVWas it the Break Down the Walls tour? That had Asking Alexandria, August Burns Red, We Came as Romans, Crown the Empire, and Born of Osiris
p8417
aVYeah! That was it. I got kicked out right after WCAR so I didn't pay much attention.
p8418
aVAh, damn, you missed a great show from ABR
p8419
aVThe Devil Wears Prada playing a local venue on their 2012 uk tour
p8420
aVThe Dead Throne tour back in 2012 with The Devil wears prada, Whitechapel, For Today and Enter Shikari.
p8421
aVHahaha okay so I think if this counts it was seeing Asking Alexandria on the "Buried Alive tour" put on by Avenged Sevenfold in 2011 Avenged played chapter four so I count it 
p8422
asVFavorite metalcore riff?
p8423
(lp8424
VOpening to Cursing Akhenaten by After the Burial
p8425
aVAnd Fractal Effect and Rareform and Beserker and Aspiration... And pretty much the whole album is a riff fest.
p8426
aVIt's such a fun album to listen to. I know it's a chugfest, but I feel like A Vicious Reforming of Features doesn't get enough love. I would KILL to see them play that one live! 
p8427
aVThe opening riff in Dispossession by Northlane.
p8428
aVI'll do my top 5:\u000a\u000a1. The Devil Wears Prada - My Questions (this entire song is just one long kick ass jam)\u000a\u000a2. The Devil Wears Prada - Escape (tough call between this one and My Questions, but this guitar riff slays)\u000a\u000a3. Structures - The Worst Of Both Worlds (god what an awesome riff)\u000a\u000a4. Of Mice &amp; Men - OG Loko (hate me for it)\u000a\u000a5. The Dillinger Escape Plan - 43% Burnt (I SMELL THAT WHORE!!!!!!!)
p8429
aVThat TDEP one is so sick
p8430
aVThat Meshuggah-esque F# based riff at the end of Cursing Akhenaten by After the Burial\u000a\u000aThe big melodic part in Sky Eats Airplane's song Alias (After the "Don't you think I can change, don't you think that I can change, just for you?" part)\u000a\u000aERRA - White Noise: Opening riff\u000a\u000aThey aren't metalcore but the opening of Periphery's Zyglrox and the opening of Periphery's Luck as a Constant
p8431
aVNot here to debate genres or attack you, but Periphery is considered metalcore and this sub definitely welcomes anything Periphery :)\u000a\u000aThe ending solo to Luck as a Constant is too good though!
p8432
aVThey're even band of the month!
p8433
aVThe one in [Doomsayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQ00DEUnl4)by Darkest Hour, it comes in at ~1:10. Or [We Stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVwLY7wlEtQ) by All That Remains. Or [Confined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI3CF3CkYKM) by As I Lay Dying. \u000a\u000aOr to go with one that's not ripping off At the Gates, [The Weak Willed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdA5Br5qGQQ) by All That Remains. 
p8434
aVThe main riff in The Weak Willed is so fucking brutal. 
p8435
aVMelodic Metalcore rarely gets heavy, I think The Weak Willed is the heaviest Melodic Metalcore song I've ever heard. 
p8436
aVOpening riff of Nothing Left by As I Lay Dying. One of the best I've ever heard.\u000a\u000aTHAT riff in Dementia by ERRA, you know which one.\u000a\u000aThe ending (last ~1 minute) of Beauty in Tragedy by ABR.
p8437
aVThat Beauty in Tragedy riff is so good
p8438
aVYep, it's also basically the song that made me fall in love with ABR.
p8439
aVFor me it was the 2nd second half of Meddler.
p8440
aVAh, for me it was Empire, since that one wasn't out yet, but I can definitely see why
p8441
aVBeauty in Tragedy live was so good, being in the pit for that was nuts.
p8442
aVThat means you just got into ABR like a year and a half ago at the most.
p8443
aVYea, I haven't been listening to metalcore for that long.
p8444
aV[deleted]
p8445
aVTie between *the* [Meddler riff](http://youtu.be/ugPxKkDmh5M?t=1m13s) and this nasty riff in [Animal Bones](http://youtu.be/hp8HL2DCbbU?t=13s)
p8446
aVThe whole Volition album in general is just full of crazy riffs
p8447
aV[Opening riff] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVP5gJBmRtA) of The End of Heartache. This song played during the end credits of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, which is the first time I heard it or anything by Killswitch. That riff is the kind of riff that makes your skin tingle and sweat a little because it's so good. I immediately had to know what band it was, and when I found out I bought the album. And that, ladies and gentlemen was how I was introduced to metalcore. 
p8448
aV[Trivium - A Skyline's Severance](http://youtu.be/ejLnrchVh18?t=2m19s)\u000a\u000aThe whole 40 second stretch is pretty dope.\u000a\u000a[Northlane - Worldeater](http://youtu.be/Wl29rKtCVe4?t=55s)
p8449
aVOpening of Through Struggle by AILD\u000a\u000aAlso, Sleepwalker by Parkway Drive
p8450
aVKarma - Parkway. You know which one
p8451
aVIt woupd have to be the riff at like the 1 minute mark of "glacial pace" by Converge.\u000a\u000aEdit: I would link, but it would use data. The line that follows the riff is "if being alive is just to survive " fuck it's so awesome
p8452
aVThis one right [here?](http://youtu.be/4eji87lXFmc?t=1m29s)\u000a\u000aOn a side note, THAT ART. Jacob Bannon produces the best art I've ever laid my eyes on. The colours, textures and layout of all his work astounds me. 
p8453
aVYep  that one, sick aye? And yes! He is such a good artist, you have to see his Jane Doe booklet too
p8454
aVYeah its a sweet riff ;) And man, I love the Jane Doe art. I just picked up this [shirt](http://kingsroadmerch.s3.amazonaws.com/images/us/1/7/8/17876_400x400.jpg) a few weeks ago, it's probably my favourite band tee!
p8455
aVI only recently bought Jane doe and looking at the booklet I was just amazed, I unfortunately haven't got any converge shirts, I'll try to buy one with the next Converge album or when I do another big deathwish haul. That shirt you got awesome, nice work!
p8456
aVThanks! They always have a few badass shirts to pick from in their merch store, you should nab one!
p8457
aVI think they were out when I did my last order, but I have two death wish shirts, la dispute, Touche Amore and Code Orange Kids shirts, but I really want mire, just shipping is unbelievable...\u000a\u000aIf they come to NZ soon, I'll make sure to pick some up.
p8458
aVYikes I could only imagine the shipping costs. You have some great taste, btw!
p8459
aVThank you, I would say you do too. Who are some of your favourites ? I decided to buy on black Friday due to the deals and the shipping added up to about 8-14% but it was a big order as I got stuff for my friend so we saved on shipping.
p8460
aVMy tastes vary quite a bit; I tend to listen to more progressive metal these days but I always go back to my metalcore roots since that's pretty much where I started when it comes to heavier music. My favourites (at the moment) are probably Protest the Hero, BtBam, Northlane, Revocation, Deafheaven, Converge, The Contortionist, Dillinger Escape Plan, Erra, and Misery Signals
p8461
aVI enjoy almost all those bands, haven't heard revocation though. I don't know much prog but I dig early mastodon 
p8462
aVRevocation is a weird one for me. I've listened to every record since their 2nd one came out and aside from a couple songs I never really got into them. I bought their latest album on a whim, loved it, and now for some reason I enjoy the previous albums that I pretty much wrote off. Anyways, they're on the thrashier side of death metal so they aren't everyone's cup of tea but listen to [Labyrinth of Eyes](http://youtu.be/CwSEJBq7gYU) and [The Blackest Reaches](http://youtu.be/l_NvpwEQj9Q) and see what you think!\u000a\u000aOh yeah, Mastodon is another one of my favourites! They've really shifted their style from their earlier stuff but they're still great. Crack The Skye is one of my favourite prog metal records if you wanna check that out too!
p8463
aVThe one after the soft part in Beauty in Tragedy by August Burns Red
p8464
aVIntro to 94 Hours or the small riff in Meddler. You know the one.
p8465
aV[As I Lay Dying - Forsaken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhD0li7KOnA&amp;t=1m55s)\u000a\u000aHits like a ton of bricks.
p8466
aVEvery riff that Andy Williams and Jordan Buckley have ever written.
p8467
aVBen Threw by Of Mice and Men
p8468
aV[December - Host](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBaZwLjbb6g)\u000a\u000aDevin Townsend produced the record. You're going to miss out if you're listening through laptop speakers.
p8469
aV[Isolation Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=3lz0ZiJjykQ#t=212) by Erra (Can't stress enough how good their old sound was back then in synergy with Alan)\u000a\u000a[Hero] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgK4vHt0Dng&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=175) by Breakdow Of Sanity\u000a\u000athe beginning of [Follow The Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0wxgZo3bgE&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=13) by Architects\u000a\u000athe beginning of [The Ghosts That Wait For Spring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCwIncm8-ZY) by The Safety Fire\u000a\u000a[It's Torn Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sATB9UDNBiE&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=231) by Veil Of Maya \u000a\u000a[If These Bullets Could Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF2brTlU3Qs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=98) by The Number 12 Looks Like You

aVThe Truth of A Liar by ABR has a super awesome riff at about a minute and a half in, I fell in love with it when I first heard it. 
p8471
aVTWDP - Constance, midway through. [Nasty.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkEAQxdw9GE&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=82)

aVOP did you like the early AA, with Austin Carlile as their vocalist?
p8544
aVI actually have only heard this album. He is the guy from of Mice and Men right?
p8545
aVYes. When he was in Attack Attack! he didn't have the awful vocal style he does now though. He was similar to The Flood and the self titled album.\u000a\u000aYou should definitely check out the sings "Stick Stickly", "Shred White and Blue", and "Dr. Shavargo Pt. 3".\u000a\u000aBe warned though, Attack Attack!'s first album is pretty heavy on the auto tune and synth stuff. Caleb Shomo (the vocalist from the album you've heard) actually played the synth back then. 
p8546
aVThat is interesting how the synth guy took over for screams. But I will definitely check into it! Thank you for the suggestions!
p8547
aVHe eventually took over the clean vocals as well.

asVDo you understand the lyrics during unclean vocals?
p8552
(lp8553
VThis use to happen to me a lot and it still does sometimes but I think after a while you become used to the pronouncing of words in screams especially from the same vocalist. \u000a\u000aSide note, it's one of the reasons people says metal sucks or whatever since they can't understand lyrics. 
p8554
aVYeah, I can't usually understand at first, but when I listen to a band enough I can understand them pretty well.
p8555
aVThat, and reading the lyrics. After reading them while listening, I almost never forget what they are again.
p8556
aVI'll be honest, I've listened to metalcore for 6-7 years and I still can't really understand. I think part of it is that I'm usually more focused on the instrumental parts of the songs rather than the lyrics
p8557
aVOnce I get used to a band/vocalist's vocal style, I don't really have any problem with it
p8558
aVI usually am able to most of the time. But for the life of me, I could not understand Jesse when I was getting into Erra. I'm not even sure what it was but it just sounds like he doesn't enunciate his words enough when he sings.
p8559
aVFor the most part yeah. Unless it's a gurgle like [Wayne Knupp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqLwL7LIWaw) or god knows what the hell [Lord Worm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkNbTS7uhLE) does.\u000a\u000aBut I can understand someone like [Stu Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nQ4ZR-NI6A),  [John Henry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QUl2AuT4ko), [Chance Garnette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX-bNkngk3U), [Phil Bozeman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3uB0jV2s48) (especially on their [newest album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9c1NaIDaAQ), [Tim Lambesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI3CF3CkYKM) (the guy from As I Lay Dying), [Bjorn Strid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl9ZfEkaqAs),[Karl Shubach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqMfm0bOFLk), [Jesse Leach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNhIw6Soa_4), [Howard Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0Em909-00Q), or [Tomas Lindberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Pm3cy3zPU) crystal clear like they're clean vocals.\u000a\u000aSome I can understand for the most part, but not completely like [Linus Bjrklund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhowrsXn8Gs), [Matt Heafy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEe3rf6gqJQ), and [Ian Bearer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQYWC9ezebw)\u000a\u000aI do struggle with some, like [Dimitri Minakakis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtbi9CHvikY), [Oliver Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8WSoKzhVfY) (I can understand the lows well enough, but his highs confuse me), [Scott Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPhvx0oywMU) (early on at least, he's clear as day on [Die Without Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjjhoQWX408), and [Jonny Davy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG7o3rWBud0). 
p8560
aVI like how you only mentioned the band on, Jesse Leach and Howard Jones aside, the best known vocalist in this (very fine) list 
p8561
aVKarl Schubach ftw. Not only an amazing vocalist (both studio and live) but a killer dude. Met him when he came through Vancouver and shot the shit about the tour, how he was enjoying Canada, etc. Bro. 
p8562
aVWhen it comes to new bands, it's definitely really hard for me. Like OAA is a different language to me most of the time, but when I read the lyrics with it, it becomes so clear obviously.
p8563
aVfirst time I listen to an album, I usually read the lyrics along with it, after that it's kinda ingrained in my head
p8564
aVYeah once I listen to it a few times and know the lyrics it's not too bad. Some of the lines are still kinda hazy though in the songs I listen to
p8565
aVI actually know the guitar parts of songs more than I know the lyrics... My ears just automatically focus on the riffs since I play. It takes some thinking to make out lyrics.
p8566
aVSame here. The guitars tend to attract me to songs (despite having not played guitar in a while) and then I get used to the vocals after listening to the song more.
p8567
aVI'm the same! Always feels weird when I go to gigs and I'm not singing along because I know the riffs more than the vocals. 
p8568
aVKinda depends for me, if it's a really high or low scream then I have trouble making it out.
p8569
aVOn the first run through, usually not. I do make an effort to get the lyrics at some point, and and it usually comes pretty easily once you read the lyrics rather than trying to pick them all out on your own. When you know what to listen for it's kind of like... "Oh, how did I not understand that?"\u000a\u000aThat said some vocalists just don't make an effort to be understood and the words never sound like words, even if you know what you're supposed to be hearing.
p8570
aVI can understand some uncleans mostly lows and mids but I can't understand vocals like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVTTZfmIo1M) ( the yrics are infront me but I'm still lost) and also I'm clueless with blackened stuff and grindcore haha
p8571
aVConverge is tricky. They do not *aim* to be understood, and sometimes the lyrics even differ from the stuff that's actually said.
p8572
aVYeah they do, the album of Jane Doe is a perfect example, great band, great album 
p8573
aVNo, English isn't my native tongue and I never really focus on the lyrics, so it's almost impossible for me to understand them without looking them up.
p8574
aVAfter listening to this type of music for as long as I have I understand most of the lyrics now. You just sort of develop an ear for it after a while.
p8575
aVMost of the time I can, but I generally don't care for the lyrics. I don't listen to metal to gain deep, philosophical worldly insight through its lyrical content. \u000a\u000aFor the most part, I listen to the instruments, but if the lyrics are jarring then it can just kill an otherwise awesome song.
p8576
aVIt depends on the vocalist for me. I can hear ADTR, Attila, I See Stars just fine but ask me to tell you the lyrics to a Miss May I song and I'll get 85% of it wrong.
p8577
aVDepends who the vocalist is and how much emphasis they use on enunciation
p8578
aVIm a vocalist so about 90 percent of the time i can. But there are certain vocalists like Mike Champa for FATS thats is just impossible for me to understand. But people like Alex Koehler from Chelsea Grin or Eddie from SS and ASP i find are really easy to understand.
p8579
aVJust part of the general consensus: I'm better now than I was when I first started listening, especially with bands I know really well. Some people are just easier to understand than others (Jake from ABR is pretty good, so was Adrian from Northlane), but sometimes I'll be like "whaaaa?" and miss what they said. But its all good. I like reading lyrics anyways. 
p8580
aVOnce you get used to it understanding them becomes second nature
p8581
aVIf I listen to a song once, very vague maybe.\u000a\u000aIf I listen to it often, I hear the lyrics clearer every time i listen to it.\u000a\u000aAlso what the top comment guy said, some words are pronounced differently in screams and it also helps to get used to certain screamers.\u000a\u000aIn some earlier albums of BMTH, Oli had very unclear screams sometimes due to his IRL english accent and he pronounces some words in screams differently than other singers.
p8582
aVWhenever anyone uses the argument "You can't understand them" or I have someone ask "Do you even understand that" I compare it to learning a new language. You don't just jump right in and understand exactly what's going on, you just have to take your time and adjust to it. I just started listening to Volumes, for instance, and I'm starting to pick up on the vocals, but it'll take a bit.
p8583
aVTHE KELLOGS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THIS \u000aSince english isn't my native tongue I always thought ABR put it into the lyrics for no reason,but then I looked it up and felt really stupid
p8584
aVNot at all.
p8585
aVSometimes.
p8586
asVWorried about the new Of Mice &amp; Men tour...
p8587
(lp8588
VWell here's the thing dude: the past few tours they've been out on were as support acts for Linkin Park, meaning they play only 30-ish minutes and try to cater to those listeners that haven't heard of them/are nu-metal fans/etc. So they play a lot of songs for that demographic. \u000a\u000aObviously, they're going to play a lot of their new stuff on a headliner too, as that's the album cycle they are touring for. They want to sell records/people to hear the new jams/stuff of that nature. But, they'll be playing a lot longer and I'm sure they do realize they have tons of fans of their first two CD's. So my point is, the setlist won't be front to back Restoring Force. My best bet would be half songs from the first two CD's, half tracks from the new record. \u000a\u000aNot a huge OM&amp;M fan, but just looking at it from past experiences/logical standpoints. CtE puts on a good show, and Volumes is sick so I'd say go to the show. Any metalcore show, especially of bands you like, is better than sitting around for the night. 
p8589
aVyeah this is what I was thinking as well. they're not gonna play the crazy stuff at a LP show, I don't blame them. 
p8590
aV[deleted]
p8591
aVIt's funny, those are all bands where I like or have liked their older stuff, but I'm really not a fan of any of their new stuff, so I'm probably not going. If only Defeater's headliner came to my state instead of this one
p8592
aVI'm in the same situation with their UK tour. The supports are awesome (The Amity Affliction and Volumes), but I know that OMAM are going to stick to their new stuff.

aVAustin tweeted they're going to play songs from every record so I think they'll have plenty of variety
p8602
aVI'd honestly say if you disliked Restoring Force don't go to a OM&amp;M concert. It'll just be a dissapointment. I love CTE and Volumes also but they tour a lot and i hated RF so I'm just gonna wait for a different tour on this one.
p8603
aVit's not that I hate it, it's just I want to see something other than it

aVI hate to be that guy, but this is grindcore and is way too good for this sub.
p8613
aVGrindcore? You sure there? Thought TDEP was considered Mathcore.  \u000a\u000aFuck genres, it's good music. Oh and nice flair.
p8614
aVThanks man. Yeah... the genre is really "noisecore" but it overlaps with the likes of "mathcore" and "grindcore." I try not to get too hung up on genres either, but it is a handy way of finding similar music and if someone were to like Dillinger and then look for similar "Metalcore" bands, they'll be severely disappointed to find that metalcore is really just emo/pop punk music with hardcore influences. 
p8615
aVYou can have that attitude, or you can see them as the kings of metalcore with other greats like Converge, Botch, Cult leader etc\u000a\u000aThough I don't think I would call any Dillinger song grindcore, at times noisecore, always mathcore but mathcore is pretty much a subgenre of metalcore.\u000a\u000aAnd the state of metalcore today is pretty bad.\u000a\u000aOh and nice flair.\u000a\u000aEdit : I forgot I changed my flair to Botch, but still all the same

aVWell...he is getting better: less auto tune each record + doesn't sound so shitty live anymore. 
p8638
aVKyle is getting better, but WCAR isn't...
p8639
aVEh, I disagree. I don't think they've progressed, but they sure haven't regressed. They're making the music they want to make, which as they grow up, happens to be less heavy. I know I for one would want them to make six different To Plant a Seed's in their career. I respect them for doing what they wanna do, I just know that there are lots of people out there like you (and there's nothing wrong with that) that will always want bands to sound exactly how they were when you first heard them. And that's just an unrealistic expectation. 
p8640
aVHonetsly, I actually liked UWWGTB more than To Plant a Seed, I thought it was a good progression. The jump from UWWGTB to Tracing Back Roots was from metalcore to almost every song being post-hardcore. I didn't want 6 TPAS either, but I wish they kept the direction they were going with the second album. They dropped the technicality which is what I and many others loved about WCAR. I can still understand why their new music is enjoyed though, it is catchier and easier to follow. I still see their live shows, and support the band's future.
p8641
aVI thought most of the tracks still sounded as if they fell into the metalcore subgenre, with a few (Fade Away, Never Let Me Go, etc.) gravitating toward radio rock. Not really post-hardcore to me. \u000a\u000aI may be one of the few, but I've enjoyed each album more than the last. And with Benedeth producing the new one, there will most likely be *even more* radio rock and less of the technicality + metalcore than there was on Tracing Back Roots. \u000a\u000aI don't really mind where they're going, I find it all to be pretty good. I just like to think of bands such as WCAR as less-talented A7X's lol. And I'd rather hear WCAR on radio (even if it is songs like Fade Away) than most of that saturated rock or indie/electronic/Imagine Dragons type shit every "rock" station plays nowadays.

aVCouldn't have said it better. People often say he is terrible live but last time I saw them he was great.

aVI guess one of those will be the song playing 9 mins into the making of LFLT video

aVOh yeah!! The album is in my opinion their best so far. Cant wait for the 2 bonus songs\u000a
p8755
aVI did t know architects were signed to Rise Records 
p8756
aVArchitects are a solid band but fuck Epitaph for forcing people to presumably pay twice for an album just to get two new songs. If they wanted to be cool about it they should have some way to get the new songs for less, or free, with proof of purchase of the original version. They must know people are going to pirate it anyway.
p8757
aVTo be fair, they're not forcing you. I bought the album, but I'm fucked if I'm gonna spend 12 again just for two songs, I'll just get them online, the same as I'm sure a large majority will. Bands complain about people downloading their music, but then sign with labels that try and double dip their fans, doesn't make sense to me.
p8758
aVBack when I used to pre-order albums I got so upset about this.  Used to.
p8759
aVOr it's *warranted* incentive for newer fans to purchase a copy. Architects are *still* touring and promoting this material (and this act itself isn't the placeholder it's become to keep a band relevant during break/recording .\u000a\u000aI became a fan of Architects in the middle of the Daybreaker cycle. I was ready to buy the original version and, boom, they announced the deluxe version - allowing me to get the grandest version of the album possible.\u000a\u000aJust have to look at it from a different angle, *especially* in Architects' case -considering that LF/LT was an acclaimed. hit, the band's highest selling record yet and they just got done supporting ETID and TGI (and IKTPQ tour in Australia's case).\u000a\u000a\u000aSometimes-necessary evil.\u000a\u000aEdit: And it's not even Epitaph, it's UNFD. Rise just partnered with them. This is just the band trying to reach a wider audience. This is the Northlane thing but backwards.
p8760
aVThey're not even new songs. If you look on Wikipedia, they were Australian bonus tracks.
p8761
aVwhy cant i find them then?
p8762
aVBecause the deluxe edition hasn't been released yet. Wikipedia isn't always reliable. 
p8763
aVNo they weren't, we received the exact same songs as everyone else in the world when it was released last year. The deluxe is being released exclusively in Australia, but we haven't gotten the tracks yet. The "bonus tracks" thing would be referring to the deluxe edition that has yet to be released. 
p8764
aVWeird. I looked on Wikipedia about a week ago and it was already there and who knows when they added it.
p8765
aVWell they announced the deluxe edition of the album over a month ago, I dunno why it's only now getting publicity. 
p8766
aVAhh, that would explain it. I was wondering why I couldn't find the songs anywhere when I looked.

asVNorthern Lights (Mikey Sawyer &amp; Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune/Michael Skaggs of Outline in Color) - ASHAMED [New Song/Band's Debut]
p8768
(lp8769
VJosh Kikta is an incredible guitar player and it really sucks that you can barely hear any guitar in there. Maybe its the shitty Facebook embedment audio compressing, but its likely that the producer is Cameron Mizell, who infamously *muted* both guitarists of Memphis May Fire on Unconditional.\u000a\u000aThey also said they'd be somewhat nu-metal, not hearing that so far. \u000a\u000aRegardless, its not bad. Looking forward to what the rest brings. 
p8770
aVJosh Kikta is incredible, but you are wrong. Cameron Mizell is a great producer and has produced many records with pronounced guitar work such as Of Machine's *As If Everything Was Held in Place* and the recent Mireau debut *The World In Your Way*.\u000a\u000aMemphis May Fire's very own guitarist and only original member, Kellen McGregor, has been producing or involved heavily in the production of every MMF release since 2010. The guitars sound the way they do on *Unconditional* because the band wants them to sound that way. That is probably the case here with this song.
p8771
aVSorry to break it to you holmes, but from personally speaking to Kellen and asking him about why the guitars are so forced to the background on Unconditional, I know it to be the case. He told me that it was intentionally made to sound that way to highlight Matty's voice and it was NOT his call...which means its either Rise, Mizell, or both. \u000a\u000aI have nothing against Cameron Mizell, I think he's pretty good at what he does and I'm a fan of a lot of it, but this does not appear to be his best work. 
p8772
aVSick as fuck, don't forget that the drummer is also from a pretty cool post-hardcore band called Elenora.
p8773
aVOf course. Nick Taylor is a beast, and [Sterling Morrison aka Ghost Noise] (https://soundcloud.com/iamghostnoise) has done some sick stuff on his own. Their future stuff is going to be much more heavily EDM-influenced. I'm so stoked.
p8774
aVI can't wait for what they have in store, it's gonna be awesome.
p8775
aVMikey is one of my favourite vocalists in the scene right now, so good. \u000a\u000aGood song, but really didn't like the production here, hopefully it improves.
p8776
aVHaven't heard a good Mizell mix in a while. Why do bands keep going to him?
p8777
aVI think it probably has to do with the contacts he could potentially set a band up with. It sure as hell isn't his mixes. 
p8778
aVAll of his mixes/production sounds the same, much like Caleb Shomo's. Sylar's debut album + Come the Dawn's debut album + Tear Out the Heart's latest album sound the same.

VThis sub and bands Facebook pages. 
p8792
aVcorrect answer. I have about 20 different bands on Facebook that I've set to get notifications whenever they post something. Usually it's boring stuff like tour announcements that won't be hitting my hometown or photos of the band's drummer like "hey i'm pissing in this plant lol!!!" or whatever but sometimes it works out really well, like yesterday when i got home from work to find DGD's new song waiting for me.
p8793
aVI follow Alternative Press on Facebook, a lot of their articles are bullshit, but they always post whenever bands announce new stuff
p8794
aVFollow bands you like on Twitter, Facebook and Insta and follow some pages (MetalSucks, Metal Injection, Alternative Press). You'll find most of the info you need on new releases from there.\u000a\u000aEdit: Follow labels as well. I follow Sumerian, and Metal Blade. You may also want to follow Solid State, Victory, etc.

aVFacebook and here, I follow a ridiculous amount of bands/labels on facebook to the point where I just made a separate profile just for music related stuff

p8805
(lp8806
VHardcore "hardcore punk" - basically heavier and faster punk. Lyrical themes are usually political or anti-conformism. Vocals are also  mostly yelling.\u000aPost-hardcore - probably the most ambiguous of the "core" genres since it literally means the movement of music after hardcore. Fugazi are credited for being pioneers of the genre so a lot of ph bands nowadays tend to have influences from them on their records. Expressiveness and punk influences seem to be what most ph bands have in common, but you can get any range of sounds from half-shouted poetry like La Dispute to screamed/diva sung vocals accompanied with super noodly guitars like Dance Gavin Dance.\u000aMetalcore "Metallic Hardcore" - it Started as metal influenced hardcore but the sound has changed quite a bit throughout the years. It's had several phases where bands like Converge, Botch, and Coalesce were the heavyweights, then it transitioned to bands like Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, and As I Lay Dying, and now bands like Asking Alexandria and a bunch of Rise Records bands seem to have taken over the genre's sound. It's gotten to the point where some bands prefer to be called metallic hardcore than be associated with "metalcore". If the song you're listening to has a breakdown that sounds like "dun dun dunna dunna dun", you're probably listening to metalcore. Also, Vocals are usually a combination of singing and screaming.\u000a

aVMetalcore is a mix of metal, and hardcore punk rock. Hardcore is just short for hardcore punk rock. Post hardcore is the new wave of hardcore punk rock, but is less actual punk rock, and more just one-note breakdowns that last the entire song it seems.

VThese guys keep getting better and better.  They help fill my love of slightly-better-than-genericore genericore.\u000a\u000aI'm really looking forward to the album.  
p8823
aVmy thoughts exactly
p8824
aVSeeing them on Saturday in Wiesbaden got two tickets but no company. Originally bought the ticket to give it to whoever who comes with me for free. \u000a\u000aBut somehow most people are busy with valentines stuff or birthdays.
p8825
aVAwww that sucks, im going to see them on the 21st in Berlin and Im so stoked, because of all the praise they get for their live shows :)
p8826
aVI kinda know that feeling wasy going to see them in Wiesbaden too with a friend but he must go to work that day now i'm going alone. Well i am still stoked to see them.

aVI like how bands who arent native English speakers have a irregular cadence. Breakdown of Sanity is pretty notable for it.\u000a\u000aIts unintentional, but its a cool effect and gives them a unique sound.

aVHonest question but aren't they more on the post-hardcore side?
p8835
aVtheyre on the edge, but /r/posthardcore is more for fans of bands like Emarosa who play a completely different version of Post Hardcore, so I thought more people here would enjoy them and their whatevercore (very generic) :)

aVI remember discovering these guys because of their Lady Gaga cover. As with most "post-hardcore" bands that do covers, I didn't listen to them much except for the cover every once in awhile. Cookie-cutter bands do covers all the time and never amount to much more.\u000a\u000aPleasantly surprised to see these guys not only upped the production quality of their music, but they also upped the quality of the songwriting itself. Good stuff

p8882
aVMan, I really I hope I get to see this guys live one more time, they put on an absolutely insane show.
p8883
aVThis obviously is subjective, but I feel like this song is the definition of metalcore. A good mix of clean and dirty vocals, intelligible all the way through. It has good dynamics instrumentally and rhythmically. And the lyrics tell a good story. This song is so good all the way 'round.
p8884
aVI'd agree with that
p8885
aVI was at this show! 
p8886
aVAnyone go to any of the free shows around dfw they've put on? The one I went to was fucking wild, one of the most fun shows I've ever been to.

p8888
aVI would recommend diving further into their music.

aVHell yeah love me some oh, Sleeper... Guess we wont hear anything new though because theyre all occupied with life and Shane has wovenwar which is steadily growing :/
p8890
aVShane has publicly stated that Oh Sleeper will always come first. They're just not doing anything currently, so he's doin the Wovenwar thing to occupy his time.
p8891
aVI missed that, thanks for filling me in
p8892
aVIt was one post Shane made shortly after joining Wovenwar, so most people missed it. Still, I want more from Oh Sleeper so badly, they're one of my favorites.

p8901
aVThis is literally shit
p8902
aVThis didn't surprise me at all.  He's been wanting to do more rock sounding stuff for quite a while. 
p8903
aVyou guys ever heard of The Damned Things? It was a sideproject that was fronted by Every Time I Die's Keith Buckley. They made some incredible hard rock. I'd love it for We Are Harlot to follow in suit.
p8904
aVI quite like the new band, and it fits his vocals incredibly well. 
p8905
aVYeah We Are Harlot is cool. You can tell Danny had quite a few difficulties with his voice through-out his carreer with Asking Alexandria (blowing his voice out, wrecking his cords). I think We Are Harlot suits his voice a lot better and probably strains his vocals cords a lot less. Besides, now AA can leave the rock 'n roll stuff behind and go back to making Metalcore on the next record.

VI'll never fully believe that the committee for the grammys sat there, listened/watched this video and nominated it for best music video. Don't get me wrong, its a gorgeous, psychedelic video and its a powerful song (one of my favorites ever). It just blows my mind a little that its THAT good. Underoath was in the zone on this album, and this video/its nomination just shows that perfectly.

aVI feel like I listen to this song and Moving For the Sake of Motion at least once a week, and I already have today. The flow between songs is so perfect, and those fucking breakdowns murder. They're the most clich thing now, but that's because everyone was trying to copy them. Drop D tuning and only one bass kick on most songs, yet Underoath managed to rip harder than just about any modern metalcore band does. I miss these guys.
p8915
aVMan, I miss these guys... Especially Aaron. 
p8916
aVSuch a good song! That ending where they hit hard at the finish is so, so good.

aVThe song that got me into heavy music.

aVThis song is probably THE metalcore jam.. but man 2:20-3:00 is god damn amazing. I love when bands put these little "jam sessions" in their songs.

p8936
(lp8937
VNot heavy. Time to give up hoping for Fall of Ideals type tracks. 
p8938
aVI'm not expecting Fall of Ideals again. I'd be ok with Overcome or even For We Are Many. The last album (A War You Cannot Win) got me thinking like "ok this isn't very good, but they'll do better on the next one." Now that we're on the next one, it's SO TERRIBLE it makes me cringe. It's bad when the newest Nickelback album is heavier than ATR. I think if I wanted to see them evolve I wish they would have evolved into something similar to the last couple As I Lay Dying albums (even though most AILD hate their last couple albums). 
p8939
aVHahaha, aside from a few cheesy lyrics, I fucking love this album. I really don't get what you people are looking for from these guys now, there's awesome guitars and crazy drums, and plenty of screaming (at least for my taste). The vocals were really the only "bad" part about this album and only a few songs at that. But a lot of the melodies just soar and kick ass, and when there is screaming it is great, especially on "Trv-Kvlt-Metal" and "Victory Lap". I don't know why y'all say they sold out and went radio friendly, because if I had a radio station around here that would play this kind of stuff I'd shit myself.
p8940
aVMusically, I think this is better than their last two or three albums. The vocals ruin the album (Have you heard "The Greatest Generation"?). Phil barely has any range and it seems emotionless, he has to depend on Jeanne for backup vox. And the lyrics! The lyrics sound like the struggles of a pubescent 13 year old kid. Honestly i dont know where this band is going to go after this album.\u000a
p8941
aVI'm just going to copy and paste what I wrote on Facebook about the album\u000a\u000aAll That Remains's new album is great just in terms of musicianship. If just looked at in terms of a heavy rock album, there are few flaws. \u000aThe disappointing thing is that ATR released, in my opinion, two of the best metalcore albums of the last decade in The Fall of Ideals and For We Are Many, and then they put out A War You Cannot Win (only 5 songs with screaming) and then The Order of Things, that has 4. I don't care if a band screams or not. Sometimes I'll say the music would sound better with screams, but that's not my criteria for judging a band. \u000aBut when you give me a song like The Weak Willed and then follow that up with What if I Was Nothing ("I told you that I loved you girl, I'm nothing without you") I'm going to be a little pissed

VI remember that during my senior year of high school (2012) during our football season, we would play music in the locker room before games and what not. For years it was all rap music or radio rock like Three Days Grace or something. One day a guy on our team blasts this song, and is like "This is so heavy! It gets me amped!" And I just shook my head and laughed. The guy asked why I laughed and I got out my ipod and was like "No, this is the heaviest song by this band," and proceeded to play "Undying". He never played another Demon Hunter song in the locker room haha

p8996
aVHow can this be called ex Attack Attack! ?\u000a\u000aThe only guy in this band who was in Attack Attack! is the vocalist, and he only ever toured with the band. Only recorded one song and it was never even meant to be released.

p8998
aVNot blaming you, just sorta putting it out there.

aVI dig it. Gonna check out their EP now, thanks!
p9004
aVThose screams are actually *fantastic*. Forgot this dude existed. \u000a\u000aSongwriting is boring overall, but this band certainly has potential
p9005
aVPeople need to stop putting "ex-AA on all of these new bands that have one or more people from AA, because honestly. Most of those bands just disband soon enough, also of course they have to end up somewhere if they want to pursue music after the AA disband :)\u000a\u000aThe song was awesome though. Except for maybe the same clean vocals during choruses as in most of these catchy metalcore bands. It's tiring and overused.
p9006
aVThat's so true, after AA broke up for good several bands had formed and disbanded. You can't use that terminology anymore.

aVDon't really like this at all, the clean vocals are not my thing.

VSick &amp; Disgusting by Caleb and the Bearteeth is probably the easiest/first one that comes to mind. \u000a\u000aI enjoy Sempiternal by BMTH front to back on a regular basis, but I'm not too crazy about Crooked Young, and I sometimes skip it on my play throughs. \u000a\u000aThe Poison by BFMV is an absolute classic but I really hate Cries in Vain. \u000a\u000aManiacal Me off Crown the Empire's new CD is really bad on my ears, dunno why. \u000a\u000aWe're Not in Kansas Anymore by I See Stars is the only song I ever skip on New Demons. \u000a\u000aThat's all I got for metalcore. 
p9015
aVSeconding Sick &amp; Disgusting. The crying makes me cringe.\u000a\u000aDon't agree with Crooked Young though, it's one of my favourites of Sempiternal.
p9016
aVYeah Crooked Young is so good 
p9017
aVI ended up just burning a version of Rise of the Runaways with Maniacal Me taken off just cause I hate it so much. It has a stupid auto tune voice in it plus they begin the song by smashing in with a really annoying guitar riff.
p9018
aVHaha love it. I should probably do the same!
p9019
aVI think Antivist is much worse than Crooked Young.
p9020
aVIt must be the 14-15 year old still inside me that gets fired up too much at "MIDDLE FINGERS UP" for me not to enjoy that track. 
p9021
aVIt's just pretty jarring that the rest of the album is kind of introspective and relatively deep then this song comes on and like you said, sounds like it's for 14 year olds.
p9022
aVIt's kinda the Football Season Is Over of Sempiternal
p9023
aVI agree it is a bit out of place, but I don't mind it. Its one of my favorite "pump-up" songs for sure. 
p9024
aVWhat's wrong with Sick and Disgusting?
p9025
aVI appreciate it for Caleb's emotion and lyrics, but its just too much for me to listen to. Ultimately, I just end up cringing in some parts and just get bored listening to it in other parts. 
p9026
aVOh okay, I gotcha. I personally love the song. But Keep Your American Dream on the other hand, it doesn't do it for me. 
p9027
aVWhy is that? Its catchy as hell and doesn't stray from the main tune of the album. I personally think its a great song. 
p9028
aVI don't really like the chorus of the song, I guess that's about it. It's the only song on the album I never stuck with. 
p9029
aVAw man Maniacal Me is my favorite from that album
p9030
aVMan Crooked Young is one of my favorites! It's got a big It Never Ends vibe to it.
p9031
aVCrooked Young is best if you think of it like the soundtrack to a movie. Definitely not the best song on the album though, I'll give you that.
p9032
aVI usually skip Maniacal me and Second Heart or whatever that songs called. They kinda ruin the flow of the album to me and kinda bore me.
p9033
aVU HAD ME @ HELLO - ADTR\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9034
aVPersonality Cult by Issues. \u000a\u000aI don't really know why, but this song sticks out like a sore thumb. It just sounded weird to me even till today. The whole album is great, but this is the only song in the album that I don't mind skipping.
p9035
aVReally? I think that's actually one of my favorites from the album, I can't really stand Tear on the Runway though I don't like their tones in it I think.
p9036
aVI loved Tears On The Runway. I'm hooked to that the whole week. To each his own i guess.
p9037
aVYeah, it's still Issues so I can listen to it I just couldn't get into it. Great album overall though!
p9038
aVFade Away by We Came As Romans. It comes off as a cheap attempt to get radio play. And while Dave's clean singing is fantastic in the other tracks he does it, in this one it's just not very good IMO.
p9039
aVBlue 42 by Haste the Day. Not a bad track by any means, but it doesn't live up to their other stuff. 
p9040
aVThat's actually one of my favorites by them! For me it would probably be The Perfect Night off of When Everything Falls.
p9041
aVBlue 42 seems to be the fan favorite track from them, for some reason. 
p9042
aVIt's the breakdowns man. They're crazy!
p9043
aVIf you're into breakdowns I can see why that would be a favorite. It's one of the most breakdown oriented tracks. I think something like If I Could See would be my favorite. 
p9044
aVI'm not a huge fan of either of ABR's Punk Goes Pop songs. They were fun to listen to at first, but that's about it
p9045
aVI have to agree with you on that even though I'm not a big ABR fan. But man, I've been jamming to their cover of Wrecking Ball all week. Gets me pumped up everytime.
p9046
aVI definitely like the Wrecking Ball cover a lot more than the other one, but I don't like either of them nearly as much as their actual stuff. I guess I'm just not a huge fan of pop covers in general
p9047
aVDon't hurt me, but Louder Than Thunder.
p9048
aVMotha fucka what?!
p9049
aVDownfall of Us All by ADTR. Ugh, I can't stand it. No idea why, but it just...makes me cringe. The "da da da da dada dada da da da dada dada" chant starts and I wanna fly as far away as possible. 
p9050
aVI love that intro lol. It's just so stupid and fun.
p9051
aVEvery song of theirs makes me cringe
p9052
aVThems fightin words
p9053
aVSHOTS FIRED
p9054
aVI really don't like Parkway Drive - Romance is Dead. I don't get the hype, I wonder if it's because it says bitch really loudly, and the teen fans like saying words that they're not allowed to home. The breakdown isn't even the best/heaviest on that album, let alone out of any they've written, and the whole song is just boring from after said breakdown. They should play A Cold Day In Hell in it's place.
p9055
aVPangea by August Burns Red. I think that might be one of, if not their weakest song. Nothing about it stands out to me.
p9056
aVI really like the intro riff, but maybe that's just me
p9057
aVIt's been so long since I've heard that song that I don't even remember how the intro goes haha.
p9058
aVAh, fair enough
p9059
aVI can tell you aren't a musician. That song is so technically loaded it's unbelievable. I welcome the downvotes, but that song beats anything of Messengers or Thrill Seeker.
p9060
aV&gt; I can tell you aren't a musician.\u000a\u000aOh. [Can you explain this then?](https://watchermt.bandcamp.com/releases)\u000a\u000a
p9061
aVLink him to Verb The Noun's fanpage too.
p9062
aV[Im looking at the sheet music right not](https://www.jellynote.com/en/score/august-burns-red/pangaea/528e0aa8a6c1996365a5a6f8#tabs:%23score_A)\u000a\u000athis is moderately difficult at best, definitely not "so technically loaded its unbelievable"
p9063
aVI've seen it man. Obviously I'm not saying ABR got Yngwie Malmsteen for the song, but compare it to almost anything on the homepage. Far and away more technical than most -core. Not to mention the drums in the song. Pangea is Greiner at his best. It has a level of refinement and intricacy that you don't often find in this genre.
p9064
aVthen youve been listening to the wrong metalcore man
p9065
aVYou're misunderstanding me. I'm not saying that Pangea is the most technical thing I've ever heard, I'm just saying that compared to most of the songs posted on here (Crown the Empire, AA, etc.) it is definitely more thought out and technically sound. I misspoke when I said the technicality is "unbelievable," but it's definitely more musically impressive than your average metalcore song.
p9066
aVthat I can agree with, at least the tabs to this song have numbers other than 0
p9067
aVEither Redemption or Care More by The Devil Wears Prada.
p9068
aVCare More &gt; Louder Than Thunder (also, everything off their first three albums)
p9069
aVnoooooooooooooooooooo
p9070
aVSinematic is still MIW's worst song, fortunately
p9071
aVI don't like MIW so maybe my opinion is invalid altogether, but America may be the worst song I've ever heard by a metalcore band. The verses make me cringe so hard, and the A-M-E-R-I-C-A chant just reeks of cheesy.
p9072
aVTotally agree, but it's not even really metalcore, it's more like wannabe Manson buttrock
p9073
aVBig fan of them here, I still agree. Not that it's the [worst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDzt6yI3Dw8) metalcore song ever, but it's pretty bad.
p9074
aVThey had another chorus or two on the new album with that formula... They're okay enough, just radio rock...
p9075
aVi love Sinematic personally. Obviously MIW is heavily influenced by Manson, but what is a band without influences? 
p9076
aVInfamous is worse
p9077
aVI actually always hate Puppets 3 by them really don't like the high pitch weird synthesizer sound at the beginning and the roars annoyed me for some reason.
p9078
aVMasquerade by Northlane. It's not that I dislike it, I just like it less than other songs
p9079
aVYOU'RE JUST A TWO FACED PIECE OF SHIT
p9080
aVAgreed
p9081
aVInteresting, that's one of my favorites of theirs
p9082
aVThat was the first song of Northlane I ever heard. I liked it, played it a lot and ended up becoming a fan of Northlane after listening trough their albums. Now I also lost interest in Masquerade. Strange.
p9083
aVI just can't get into Within Destruction by As I Lay Dying. I absolutely love An Ocean Between Us but that song is the only flaw on an otherwise flawless album.
p9084
aVTo plant a seed by WCAR.\u000aI love WCAR by I am definitely not a fan of that song.
p9085
aVMMF Miles Away\u000a\u000aMMF Speechless\u000a\u000a\u000aNot as cringeworthy as Matty's solo album but pretty close
p9086
aVMiles Away is so shit, brings down the album a lot. Haven't heard Speechless though. 
p9087
aVHonestly, Danger: Wildman by Devil Wear Prada. I enjoy that song right up until the clean bridge where they make Jeremy sound like a pop diva with an absurd amount of autotune (especially "when FORGOOOOOOTEENN".) I prefer Jeremy's more genuine voice now.
p9088
aVBruhh
p9089
aVWhen doubted his truth reveals incredible vengeance...
p9090
aVisn't it trevor from our last night?
p9091
aVIs it? Damn I don't why they would mess with his voice so much, he's not a bad singer.
p9092
aVI'm pretty sure Trevor only screams in Danger: Wildman.... I could be wrong though.
p9093
aVNah that's Jeremy. Trevor does a back and forth with Mike during the last bit of the song. I think his opening line is "the sun and the moon"
p9094
aV"Seen It All Before" by BMTH. It seems like a carbon copy of the song before it, imo.
p9095
aVEven tho it seems to be everyone else's favorite I can't stand Open Letter by The Amity Affliction. You can hate me now.

p9122
asVWhat band do you think got progressively worse and what band got better?
p9123
(lp9124
VWorse: Miss May I, MMF, Asking Alexandria, Beartooth (I liked the Sick EP, but didn't really like Disgusting), The Color Morale\u000a\u000aBetter: Architects, blessthefall, Breakdown of Sanity, ABR\u000a\u000aI'm going to add a new category called\u000aDon't know yet: ERRA, Northlane, The Plot in You
p9125
aV&gt; Beartooth (I liked the Sick EP, but didn't really like Disgusting)\u000a\u000aI don't think you can really count Beartooth, seen as they've only released these 2 records. And in fairness, Sick was an amazing EP, it was always going to be hard to beat.
p9126
aVI feel like a lot of the people who liked sick don't care for disgusting, and vice-versa. They're just different. I like both a lot myself though.
p9127
aVI loved both. I don't quite understand how people could dislike either, they're both so good. 
p9128
aVMiss May I is a great example. It's not like the general trend is worse, I personally believe every album is worse than its predecessor, black in white. I do feel though that their next album would be a change and be on par with Monument. A guitarist in another band told me that apparently Levi wasn't happy at all with Rise of the Lion, and I feel like them releasing it and listening to it over a couple years will be enough to push them away from it. Hell, they're already dropping Rise of the Lion songs off their setlist (they're down to 25% now).
p9129
aVWho was it that told you that?
p9130
aVOne of the guys in Affiance. I don't want to be any more specific than that.
p9131
aVThat's fine. Makes sense too, RotL is absolutely horrible.
p9132
aVIt had a few redeeming riffs and Jerod hasn't yet shit the bed (though he's still not as good as he was on Apologies), but there were a lot of boring parts on the album and Levi just sounds like a frog... I don't know how that happens after having a good album vocal performance, a decent one, and an ok one. I actually just listened to that album again (I like to listen to the discography of a band again after I've seen them recently)
p9133
aVI could surely agree with AA between R&amp;R and FDTD but suas and R&amp;R are great albums I could definetly see the new album being about as good as them.
p9134
aVWorse: Of Mice &amp; Men\u000a\u000aBetter: Ice Nine Kills
p9135
aVOMAM? I thought Restoring Force was amazing.
p9136
aVNot sure if serious. 
p9137
aVI am
p9138
aVColor me shocked people actually liked RF\u000a\u000aIn all seriousness, it's a good album if you consider the fact that they're no longer metalcore.
p9139
aVWell that's the thing, really. I'm not genre-specific with the music I like, so sure it's not what we're used to with OMAM but I personally thought it was amazing.
p9140
aVBLASPHEMY
p9141
aVwell you're wrong
p9142
aVWorse - Asking Alexandria. \u000a\u000aBetter - I See Stars. 
p9143
aVI See Stars is a perfect example. 3D was an incredible release and then End of the World Party was just...ugh. But since then they've slowly but surely been getting better and better.
p9144
aVWorse: The Amity Affliction, Bullet for My Valentine, Miss May I. After the Burial, The Color Morale, The Word Alive\u000a\u000aBetter: Breakdown of Sanity, Bring Me the Horizon, Bury Tomorrow, Confession, Ice Nine Kills, I Killed the Prom Queen, I the Breather, Oh Sleeper, Wolves at the Gate
p9145
aVI sorta disagree with ATB. Yeah In Dreams wasn't as groovy and shreddy as Rareform, but it's a really melodic album, which I love. And Wolves Within was a great combination of both of the two and imo is on par with Rareform. FAFF damn good too, but pretty different compared to the rest. 
p9146
aVyea, I'm not saying they're bad by any means, just think each album wasn't as good as the one before it, and I liked Wolves Within just thought it was a little too chuggy at times
p9147
aVOf the bands I listen to, I agree. With one exception: Bury Tomorrow.\u000a\u000aRunes is a great album and has some jams (Man on Fire, The Torch), but it doesn't quite top The Union of Crowns for me. The latter just feels like more of a cohesive and consistent album. Portraits was also good, but I'll concede that both of their following albums are better.
p9148
aVWorse: Asking Alexandria, Miss May I, All That Remains, Memphis May Fire, OM&amp;M\u000a\u000aBetter: BMTH, TDWP, August Burns Red, Architects
p9149
aVI agree with most of that.  I'd say that BMTH got progressively different, not better.  \u000a\u000aThey kicked ass at deathcore, and they are pretty good at....  whatever it is you'd call what they do now.
p9150
aVIts actually sad that i agree with you on Miss May I. i loved Relentless Chaos and then after that i could really listen :(
p9151
aVI agree completely although i never liked Miss may i they sounded horrible both times i saw them and this was before i heard a single song from them on top of that the singer cant sing whats so fucking ever.
p9152
aVI think the singer is *okay*, he's not amazing but there are some much worse singers out there.
p9153
aVWorst: Billy Talent\u000a\u000aBest : I can't think of any, if I like the band I will almost love every release by them\u000a
p9154
aVWhat'd you think of Billy Talent's new single 'Kingdom Of Zod' a few months back?\u000a\u000aI think they've definitely gotten a slightly more mainstream sound and haven't changed their style too much with every release, but every release has sounded more refined to me than the last and I love all of them.\u000a\u000aObviously, it's cool if you're not a fan, but just wondering what your perspective is.
p9155
aVI actually enjoyed kingdom of zod a lot, a catchy chorus. To tell you the truth the reason why I thought they had got worse was because i was obsessed with them  and just loved the first two albums. Live they were good!
p9156
aVWhat..? Every single thing BT has ever put out has been amazing. Dead Silence wasn't as good as their first 3 albums, but I don't think it was *that* much worse that you needed to include them in this. Kingdom of Zod is a sweet track, too.
p9157
aVWorse: MMI, MMF, AA, The Color Morale, Bullet For My Valentine (heres hoping that changes), As I Lay Dying^^^I'msorry\u000a\u000aBetter: Blessthefall (though theyve always been amazing, theyre just more amazing), I See Stars, BMTH, Fit for a King
p9158
aVWorse: Of Mice &amp; Men\u000aBetter: I See Stars\u000a\u000aAbsolutely most consistently perfect band in the world: Silverstein.
p9159
aVWorse: Of Mice &amp; Men, The Acacia Strain, Avenged Sevenfold (they got better until they peaked with City of Evil), Bullet for My Valentine, The Devil Wears Prada, Miss May I, Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, In Flames (I don't like anything they put out after Colony), The Showdown, A Skylit Drive\u000a\u000aBetter: Protest the Hero, As I Lay Dying, Black Veil Brides, Bring Me the Horizon, Misery Signals, Chelsea Grin, Rings of Saturn\u000a\u000aConsistent: Killswitch Engage, August Burns Red, Carnifex, blessthefall, Every Time I Die, Haste the Day, Parkway Drive, 
p9160
aVI am going to respectfully disagree with you opinion on Prada. 8:18 is a masterpiece. \u000a\u000aHowever, I very very agree with Protest the Hero. 
p9161
aVI like 8:18 but hated the vocals on it. I would say that they have been getting better with each release but With Roots Above is by far my favorite and Plagues is second, just since I've listened to them so much. With Roots Above is actually probably my favorite album ever.
p9162
aVI wasn't big on 8:18. Too much focus on the synths and not enough on the guitars for me. But it is a step up from Dead Throne and there are a couple tracks I really like. \u000a\u000a
p9163
aVDownvoted for your opinion, as usual. I love 8:18 to death but there's nothing wrong with not liking it. 
p9164
aVTotally disagree with Chelsea Grin getting better. I liked Ashes to Ashes a lot, but i don't think it's anywhere near as good as My Damnation or the self titled.
p9165
aVMusically ashes was amazing but Alex and his lyrics...
p9166
aVYeahhhhh
p9167
aVIt wasn't much of a step up from My Damnation imo. Both are great.
p9168
aVHit the nail on the head with TDWP
p9169
aVI always thought protest the hero was consistent with their music, scurrilous was the only album i didn't like and kezia i still think is their best album.
p9170
aVThey've been consistently great no doubt. but I would say they've gone from being a 4/ 5 on Kezia to a 5/5 on everything since. Part of why Kezia strikes me as their weakest, is the fact that it seems the least Protest of their albums. It doesn't really have the crazy, proggy, wank that their other three have. It's actually closer to something Avenged Sevenfold might have put out in their metalcore days, not that that's a bad thing.  Also I think the transitions into the piano/acoustic segments and the production are shoddy. \u000a\u000a&gt;scurrilous was the only album i didn't like\u000a\u000aReally? Scurrilous is my favorite, with tracks like Dunsel, Tapestry, Termites and C'est la Vie.
p9171
aVThe piano and acoustic was part of the reason i love kezia it reminds me alot of between the buried and me. I mistated about scurrilous i like the album its just my least favorite of their stuff mostly because i only like a few of the songs off of it (C'est la vie is a amazing song) so thats the only reason i consider it a little lower.
p9172
aVThe segments themselves are fine (I especially the piano at the end of I think either No Stars Over Bethlehem or Divinity Within). It's just the transition to them I have a problem with. Compare the acoustic bits in Blindfolds Aside (I think that's the track, if not it's the one with the line about cigarettes) to Skies from their newest album Volition. 
p9173
aVSkies acoustics are amazing! I think the kezia transitions are great as well, but who knows i might just be fanboying about the album too much.
p9174
aVMaybe, maybe I'm remembering wrong. I recall there being a short gap in sound between them. 
p9175
aVI don't remember one, but now if i go back and listen ill probably notice the gap.
p9176
aVThere's definitely one in Divinity Within. 
p9177
aV[deleted]
p9178
aVI'll agree somewhat on SS, You Can't Stop Me was better than the last two. \u000a\u000a
p9179
aV[deleted]
p9180
aVI think mitch is fine, I just never liked the actual music they put out. But The Cleansing was at least listenable, compared to the next two. 
p9181
aV[deleted]
p9182
aVWorse: A Skylit Drive, Crown The Empire, FATS\u000a\u000aBetter: Attack Attack! (When they were still around)
p9183
aVWorse: The Color Morale  \u000aBetter: Architects
p9184
aVBetter: Unearth.\u000a\u000aI've got a list but I wanted to highlight this one. I feel like this band has gotten better with each release (with the exception of The March). They want from a terrible metalcore band, to a decent but relatively generic metalcore band, to an awesome thrashy metalcore band with shitty production, (to a slower boring metalcore band), to a very melodic, not outdated metalcore band, and finally to a gutsy hard-hitting metalcore band. One of the few metalcore bands who actually play more blast beats as they release new albums.
p9185
aVWatchers of Rule from last year is my mother fucking shit, nigga! 
p9186
aVThe Swarm was the first song I heard off of it (it was the single) and the beginning of it with the muted crashes and then the jump into trad blast beats just blew me away. If you listen to the average song off of The March and then listen to The Swarm, you really do respect the band.
p9187
aVWorse, then better: Falling In Reverse - because of their new album, lol.\u000a\u000a
p9188
aVTheir new album isn't bad, it's far better than their last.  I see a lot of hate for Falling in Reverse lately but I bet most of them haven't listened through the album.  A few songs are misses but most of the album is pretty good.  
p9189
aVAm I the only one that thinks that BMTH got worse and actually thought Count your blessings was their only good album?\u000a\u000amaybe its because I am more of a deathcore than a metalcore fan
p9190
aVWorse: Memphis May Fire\u000aBetter: Asking Alexandria
p9191
aVWorse: Of Mice and Men and Asking Alexandria obviously, but I have a good feeling about AA upcoming album seems like it's gonna be breakdowncore like their first album\u000a\u000aBeter: Attack Attack, letlive., Pierce The Veil, Bring Me The Horizon, I See Stars, Enter Shikari, Motionless in White, Blessthefall, Vanna\u000a\u000aConsistent (good): A Day To Remember, Crown The Empire, August Burns Red, Every Time I Die, Dance Gavin Dance, Issues
p9192
aVKind of hard to say Issues is consistent considering they've only put out one EP and one album ( not including the acoustic album). I do hope they stay consistent with their next album and integrate Michaels harsh vocals just as much and if not more.
p9193
aVWorse: Asking Alexandria, Beartooth, Of Mice &amp; Men\u000a\u000aBetter: The Color Morale, Bring Me the Horizon, Memphis May Fire, August Burns Red, the list goes on
p9194
aVBetter: Dillinger Escape Plan, Periphery, Within The Ruins\u000a\u000aWorse: BMTH, Northlane, In Hearts Wake, Architects, After The Burial, Volumes, Betraying The Martyrs
p9195
aVI don't know if you can say In Heart's Wake or Northlane got worse...they both put of superb debut albums and then followed up with fairly solid records (I actually like Singularity more than Discoveries, but to each their own). 
p9196
aVI'd have to say Dillinger have been extremely consistent in my opinion, every album was great but my favourite three are the first two and last one haha
p9197
aVWorse: Sworn In (even though I've never really been a fan of any of their stuff), post-MDIYE The Color Morale, Beartooth\u000a\u000aBetter: August Burns Red, Blessthefall, The Chariot (before they broke up :(), Defeater, Erra, Fit For a King, letlive., Northlane, The Overseer, Wolves at the Gate

p9233
aVI think my favourite few seconds of the album is at 2:45. Those cleans are great.
p9234
aVI love this band so much.
p9235
aVNot my favorite from the album but still great.
p9236
aVI remember when the album dropped I replayed this song so many times. The chorus is so catchy
p9237
aVI really like The amity affliction, but I like Chasing Ghosts better. This album seems a little more personal which is fine, but it tends to get depressing if you really pay attention to it as it goes on. 
p9238
aVNot trying to be rude so don't take it that way. \u000aCan someone explain to me why they like this band? I just don't get it and would like someone else's perspective. 
p9239
aVI first saw amity affliction at warped 2013, they put on an awesome stage prescence and were incredibly friendly and talkative with the crowd. They have a great clean vocalist, their screamed vocals might be a bit weak in some other bands with different sounds, but their songwriting works to maximize what joel birch can do with his voice, which excels in the right environment. lyrically, they have lots of hopecore lyrics, but the delivery of them seems so much more sincere and personal than other bands (the song Pittsburgh was about a very serious near death experience for birch), plus they don't really advertise it despite being a major facet of their music. Also the group chorus on Pittsburgh gives me chills every time. if I were to sum it uo though, I would say their greatest strength is that they are able to skillfully pull off a lot of elements in their songs that might sound generic or insincere in other bands but they have an x factor that makes them so great
p9240
aVWell said.
p9241
aVThanks for replying. I saw them on the first stop of the disobedient tour in sac. I actually did not like the cleans at all while the tight the screams were okay. What bugs me more than anything is that nothing stood out for me. 
p9242
aVI started liking them just before Warped Tour ~~2012~~ 2013 and fell in love with the clean vocals and how catchy they were. The screams are really powerful without being growls. I was worried their live performance wouldn't be good just because of how high his cleans are. To my surprise they were spot on live. They were way better than I expected, and they were so happy on stage and so appreciative of everyone being there. They really surprised me live with how good they were. Some of their music might be a little generic, but overall they're catchy and enjoyable to listen to, and their live show is awesome.\u000a\u000aEdit - it was actually 2013 Warped Tour, they start to blend a little after going 5 years in a row 
p9243
aVJoel Birch doesn't so much scream as he does shriek and wail. But that's what gives him his own sound, and it's rad as fuck!
p9244
aVYa I get what you mean, it's a very raspy throaty scream. I love screams like that, right on the edge haha 
p9245
aVoh look another metalcore band that hasnt changed in 6 years, used to listen to these guys but theyre just same old same old, always with the ocean metaphors
p9246
aVTheir styles changed drastically over the years idk what you complaining about lol sour as fuck
p9247
aVwhat? majority of their songs are so generic and follow something like my life sucks, metaphor about an ocean, I'm either okay/not okay. It hasnt changed at all. I dont like it but they have a targeted fan base which is edgy and tumblr teir teens but it works for them I guess.
p9248
aVI think unlike most "helpcore" bands, Amity's messages are sincere and real, and not an attempt at targeting a specific demographic. 
p9249
aVObviously music is a very subjective form of expression and it's why I'm not saying don't listen to these guys but for me personally I went through a metalcore only phase but I've grown up and expanded my musical interests. Metalcore still remains to be one of them but for me personally I'm very picky when it comes to metalcore and bands like amity because I don't think they offer anything to a stagnating genre but I know why people would like the genericness of it because I was once like that. I just don't think they're that great, that's just my opinion and my musical inclination but when a band does the same thing for the same audiance it gets old.

aVAnd then you have Northlane and Parkway Drive, named after roads. (Maybe not Northlane but it sounds like it) Don't get me wrong I like the bands but stuff like Buried in Verona and Dream On, Dreamer are much more interesting names. The Amity Affliction is a great one too. 
p9274
aVNorthlane is named after the Architects song.
p9275
aVParkway Drive isn't just any old street. It's the name of the street where the drummer's parents lived, and where they started the band, practiced, and played shows. That's pretty cool.
p9276

p9282
aVHahaha, he sold his drums to the band I'm in, so his drums play for us I guess...

aVI had a friend that used to drum for Drowning Atlantis. Left cause bad lol

aVIn all fairness though, I go to a fuckload of shows and I've never even heard of these guys with We Built Atlantis being the exception.      \u000a\u000aThey're all shitty local bands, take no notice.
p9287
aVThe local scene is great here, if you're not going to local shows and just think they're "shitty" then you're missing out. True there is a lot of shit going around, but there is a lot of great music as well.
p9288
aVSome of them genuinely are shitty though. I may have exaggerated with "all" but not every local band is top-tier quality.
p9289
aVOh yeah you're neck deep in shit before you find one good band haha, but once you find them
p9290
aVThis is so true, especially in the core genres I find.
p9291
aVFor your information Atlantis Awaits from Canberra are pretty good
p9292
aVI did say I over exaggerated with "all" of them being shitty.

VNice writing. I liked the line about OM&amp;M eventually becoming Linkin Park. I think you were pretty spot on concerning OM&amp;M's potential, too. 
p9309
aVDoes no one else think that maybe Austin just can't scream like he used to anymore?? 
p9310
aVI felt that way because when first hearing Bones Exposed, it sounded so different that I feel like he just lost it
p9311
aVSo I just listened to the performance he did with suicide silence and he can still scream.... I'm thinking they just sold out and want a bigger fan base 
p9312
aVIt's sad to accept it when they're one of the first bands that brought me deeper into the genres.
p9313
aVHonestly I still feel like their first album was their best... The flood was good, don't get me wrong but for me nothing else they did compared to their first album 
p9314
aVFirst album was easily the best, only the flood and the depths compete with it IMO
p9315
aVHe just can't scream like his old screams live anymore. He can actually do whatever weird throat noise he makes now live. It sounds exactly the same ironically. But he can't do his old frys live anymore, and I feel that drove him to find a different vocal..."technique"(?).

I was excited for their album, then they released "Bones Exposed" which gave me extremely high hopes but it all killed my buzz in my end. I still respect them but I mainly listen to their older albums
p9323
aVAustin can't scream anymore like he used to. The newer songs aren't great. Restoring Force wasn't necessarily all that bad in my opinion. Glass hearts and would you still be there are probably the best songs on that album. Us fans can complain all we want, but we should remember that at the end of the day it's the band's decision to make this kind of music or that kind of music.
p9324

VI was at the Lawrence show, had a great time. My only complaint was Northlane, something with their sound levels was really messed up and you couldn't even hear any vocals, everything else was good though.\u000a\u000aFit For A King totally blew me away though. I have been a fan for a while, just never seen them live. I thought they honestly sounded the best out off all them that night.\u000a\u000aErra's lead singer was a pretty funny guy. Before the last song he said, "This next one is so heavy I don't think I will be able to pick it up."\u000a\u000aMiss May I was also really good, which was surprising to me.\u000a\u000aABR had some intense energy, they did not screw around between songs, and just kept going like a bunch of machines. The lights were amazing, along with that badass drum solo part.\u000a\u000aIn the end, the VIP tickets were worth it. The best $60 I have spent in a long time.
p9328
aVI like going to the gym, so when Jake took 20 minutes to stop and talk about this protein powder, it really connected with me and I felt like ''wow he's just like me'' and it saved my life

p9330
aVI never go on corejerk, just thought the protein thing was funny when he did it
p9331
aVAh, true, seems like it was just a one time thing though, he didn't do it at the date I went to
p9332
aVAll I know is that that was the best I've seen them for about the past two years. That huge break they took off to write really helped Jake out a lot.\u000a\u000aMy favorite part though was [Jake pig-squealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igDaU6Qla14#t=179) to the end of Back Burner. I was up in front and was just jacked up to hear it like that. The video doesn't do it justice though! ;)
p9333
aVYeah, Back Burner is always crazy live, and Jake's pig-squeals just make it even crazier. It's funny, I'm usually not a fan of them, but when Jake does them it sounds great
p9334
aVI was at that show! And yeah, he stated doing the squeals my jaw fell. \u000a\u000aThat show was so fun, it was soon out I found out after and man, it was packed. My ankles were all brushed up from how crowded the front was. Incredible show. 
p9335
aVYeah dude, I got stuck looking for my buddy haha and it was so damn cold out!!
p9336
aVIt was fricking cold waiting to get in. Haha, it was my buddy's first show ever, and he was mad that I made him do shorts and a tank when we were outside... But he understood once the pit stated getting hot. 
p9337
aVDude I totally feel you. I normally wear shorts to all my concerts up in the cities, but I had a vip pass so I went with pants? Why? And a button up? I ruined it up front hahaha.
p9338
aVHaha, it was hot in there for sure. 
p9339
aVI was at the show in Cleveland, and it was my first time in the pit. Had a guy crowdsurfing fall on my head and almost break my neck, but it was definitely worth it! Crossroads had some good food too, so if you guys are ever there check em out. 
p9340
aVIt's was just as expected, ABR killed it. I knew I'd enjoy Fit For A King's set, even though I'm not a huge fan. I liked Miss May I when they played their good songs(Monument era). \u000a\u000aI also had to take an elevator to the upper floor for accessible seating, because I had slang my ankle and had to use crutches. The view ways just above on the right of the stage so I got to see everything. \u000a\u000aOn the way up to that seat Ryan Neff held the elevator door so I could get on. I didn't say anything because it was before the show and he seemed like he was getting in the zone. I don't know, I thought it was cool.
p9341
aVI'm seeing them tonight and reading through this is just getting me so hyped!
p9342
aVi was at the boston show and the most memorable part was fit for a king doing warpath. Ryan is so sick live.
p9343
aVThat's the show I was at too, Fit For a King was definitely great, and I got to talk to Ryan for a while after the show
p9344
aVhes a super nice down to earth dude
p9345
aVHe really is
p9346
aVYeah, dude, that was the best show I've ever been too. As I commented earlier today, August Burns Red is so amazing live, their album's don't do em justice. They're so tight (although Jake messed up once near the end), they're jumping around and still sound fantastic. And *their lighting is AMAZING.* Seriously. The flashes and colors were timed and themed to the lyrics and movements in the song. A couple instances that stuck out to me was during the line "This is our darkest hour", the lights switched from swirling colors to just a dull yellowish in the back, making  Jake look like a baroque hero silohuetted against the darkness. Also a couple of times, Jake ended the song by closing his fist (like an orchestra conductor does) and the music and roving/flashing lights suddenly stopped, leaving the audience with suddent silence and darkness. Their live show is an all-encompassing, nearly ethereal experience that it's just impossible to get just listening to the albums.And that drum "solo" in which all the band members came out on stage and played drums. That was so cool, and definitely not something I've seen any other metalcore band do. Yeah, so, August Burns Red deserves the hype.\u000a\u000aThe other bands were really good too, I don't really listen to them, but Northlane and Miss May I were extremely entertaining (and Miss May I's clean singer was actually really good, something we didn't get with Erra. Seriously, that guy was shrieky.) Fit For A King was cool. At the end, their vocalist did that super long scream from "Warpath" (I am the eneMAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY) for 15-20 seconds. The crowd went wild.\u000a\u000aI also bought that August Burns Red Smoky the Bear shirt that says "ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT HORRIBLE MUSIC". Saw that one in 2013 and I wanted it then but had no money.\u000a\u000aFinal thoughts: You just need to see ABR live for yourself because, even though I could probably accurately describe just how phenomenal they are, I don't have the patience. Seriously. Go see them next time they're in your town.\u000a\u000aNinja edit: Just to plug the lighting one more time, by best friend was with me, and he says the only band he's ever seen with better lighting than ABR was Pink Floyd.
p9347
aVYea that long scream was insane. I couldn't believe how long he did it.... seriously that was impressive.
p9348
aVYeah, it was definitely a great show, I really liked Erra's clean vocalist though, sure, he has a high-pitched voice, but the parts sounded really good live. Also, I have that same shirt, got it at their 2013 fall headliner.
p9349
aV&gt;A couple instances that stuck out to me was during the line "This is our darkest hour", the lights switched from swirling colors to just a dull yellowish in the back, making Jake look like a baroque hero silohuetted against the darkness.\u000a\u000aThat could be the most beautiful description of a concert I have ever read.

p9358
aVVanna when they opened for Beartooth has still put on the wildest show I've ever been to. Crowd surfing didn't stop and the whole venue was the one big moshpit. God I miss it.
p9359
aVEspecially their new stuff. The vocals just sounds so odd on that album but they put on a damn good show.
p9360
aVExactly, I wasn't too into them, but then I saw them with Beartooth last fall, and they put on a great show
p9361
aVSame. It was sick when he came down into the crowd to finish out the set with Digging. Would definitely like to see them again some time. 
p9362
aVThat was great, it was especially cool because my date of the tour was their hometown show, so their whole set was just really full of energy
p9363
aVPierce The Veil puts on a good live show from what I've seen and heard.
p9364
aVThey do actually seen them live twice both times with Sleeping with Sirens. Both times Pierce the Veil put on an awesome show tons of crowd involvement and really having a fun time.  Then SWS comes out and it's just Kellin with other people supporting him. And everybody jerks them off for it.
p9365
aVPierce the veil, my friends who usually do nothing but hate on them went to see them and came back impressed.\u000aalso not metalcore but I for instance only like Battle Beast live and think their albums sound worse than their live sound...
p9366
aVI only like OM&amp;M's new stuff when it's played live.
p9367
aVWhenever they were still around the only way I could listen to The Chariot was really live. Best live band in the world.
p9368
aVCrown The Empire
p9369
aVCrossfaith... their music isn't particularly good, but they're fun live.
p9370
aVThis is the correct answer. Really not into their studio stuff but they really know how to tear shit up on stage.
p9371
aVAtilla
p9372
aVWell I would see a lot of bands that i'm not super keen live if i had the chance just I don't get the chance.\u000a\u000a\u000aLocally there is some alt rock that bores me a bit when it isn't being played live and the latest three albums by Die Die Die are very held back/tame on the record but live they are great. 
p9373
aVCaliban. They're pretty big here in Germany because they've been around since... uh... forever. But they're really not a band I enjoy on record. Seeing them live is a completely different thing though. They're really giving it their all and it shows.
p9374
aVTrivium is exactly that band for me. I like maybe 4-5 of their songs on the records, but I will always see them play live. They put on a great show, keep it very tight, and really connect with the crowd.
p9375
aVProbably Slipknot. They feel like they would give a hell of a show. 
p9376
aVThe Chariot and Crossfaith.\u000a\u000aI love their Zion EP both live and recorded, but for everything else I mainly prefer it live.
p9377
aVNot metalcore at all but a friend of mine got me to go to a combichrist show. I'm seeing them for the third time here pretty soon and I still don't listen to them but they are a ton of fun live.
p9378
aVOnly saw combichrist bc they were opening for Rammstein but once they were playing I got into it and realized they're pretty sick live!
p9379
aVPWD and ABR are amazing live. Still love their studio versions but it's not the same since they both deliver something different on stage
p9380

sVSongs with "orchestral-sounding" music?
p9390
(lp9391
VFirst off, I don't get much of  an "orchestral" vibe from that song, but more like an anthem song. Honestly, if you like that sound you should check out My Chemical Romance's album The Black Parade, because it's full of anthem-y songs like this. \u000a\u000aSecond, while nothing like the song you used as an example, Between the Buried and Me's music has always had a classical/orchestral sound to it in my opinion.  I think this song is a good example: http://youtu.be/AhtKu8gVE2c \u000a\u000aYou may like what happens around the 4:20 mark :) 
p9392
aVNot metalcore but Fleshgod Apocalypse is a collision between symphonic death and classical. Its fun as shit and over the top to listen to.
p9393
aVI think Betraying The Martyrs is what you're looking for. \u000a\u000aThe Human Abstract also has an EP of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.  
p9394
aVTwo bands you should listen to: In Fear And Faith and Dead Silence Hides My Cries
p9395
aVIntentions by We Came as Romans has a pretty cool orchestral part it's not super long but it's dope
p9396
aVBorn Of Osiris - Machine, Divergency, Imaginary Condition, Illusionist, Source Field, Vengeance. All have orchestral instruments/synth work. Apart from that i'm stuck.\u000a

p9407
aVwe came as romance have some synth that sounds orchestral like... but im not entirely sure i understand what you are looking for
p9408
aVNot sure what genre they would be, but Kamelot has an opera/orchestra feel to them. 
p9409
aVI've always felt as though KSE with Howard had a sort of operatic sound to it sometimes.  That dudes voice is the shit.
p9410
aVI agree. His voice is amazing in its own way
p9411
aVListen to In Fear and Faith. They are no stranger to orchestral sounds.\u000a\u000aThey even released an EP that takes their biggest songs up to that point and did them orchestrally (sp?) with vocals.\u000a\u000aAlso, quite a few songs on City of Evil by A7x have orchestral parts. Blinded in Chains and Strength of the World to name a few

aVYoukhana's verse is fucking reckless. He killed it. This whole album is fucking golden.
p9418
aVThis is a good closer to the album, I REALLY could have done without the rap though. I mean it's their debut album, they have a great vocalist, and the last thing they have us hear is some guest vocalist rapping? Ehhhh...\u000a\u000aEdit: Oh right, this sub doesn't like people having opinions.
p9419
aVWhen that part came up the first time I listened through it somewhat ruined the song for me. It was pretty unexpected and I couldn't help but cringe a little listening to it.\u000a\u000ae. Fuck opinions

aVI'm loving your flair bro, didn't realise you were a fan of them.\u000a\u000aAnd fair enough view!
p9512
aV[deleted]
p9513
aVFor me it really doesn't affect what I think of the music, as long as I still think the songs are good. I like new Miss May I stuff, and just because it happens to get played on the radio sometimes doesn't really change my opinion on it. On the other hand, I can't stand new Of Mice &amp; Men, and think it's really boring and generic. I just think some bands are better at pulling off that sound than others. Regardless of whether I like it, it does definitely bring more exposure to the genre, which in a way is good, though often it leads to much more focus on those sorts of bands, rather than the bands I feel are pushing the genre forward, like August Burns Red, Architects, and Northlane. Overall, I think it's a very mixed thing, if done right, it's good music that might also appeal to non-metalcore fans, but if done badly, it's just a cash grab that leads to unnecessary focus on bands that don't really deserve it. 
p9514
aVWell said. I don't really have anything to add haha.
p9515
aVHonestly, 50/50 here. I think it does support the whole -core genre if there's OM&amp;M, MMF etc on radio stations so people go check them out, maybe even their older stuff. Then they have the "people that liked this also listen to XY" kinda stuff on spotify, iTunes etc. so they're probably going to branch out and listen to other kind of heavy music and thus may or may not fully commit to this genre.\u000a\u000aOtherwise, it kind of hurts the "reputation" of metalcore bands (it's not like metalcore is loved anyways), but as long as the really good, innovative bands (think ABR, Northlane, ERRA etc) don't go full sellout-mode, I don't really care that much since I'll always keep listening to what I like regardless of how it's reputation is or what the fuck people are talking about it.
p9516
aVYeah I agree with what you're saying about more people possibly branching out into heavier music. I think most of the distaste towards it comes from fans that have been there since the beginning and watching them "sell out" and start to abandon their original sound, which is understandable.\u000a\u000a
p9517
aVI've heard ETID on satellite radio on liquidmetal and lithium (if anyone knows those) but they usually play songs like The New Black, or We'rewolf.
p9518
aVI don't know about you but I really like We'rewolf haha
p9519
aVI like both of those songs too, but they are some of ETID's more radio friendly songs.
p9520
aVTrue, where I live they wouldn't play it but its definitely more accessible 
p9521
aV&gt;Do you think this is a good or a bad thing for the metalcore genre as a whole?\u000a\u000aNeither. And both. On one hand it brings in new fans, new revenue, and more interest in the genre. On the other hand, labels and bands see that becoming more radio friendly makes more money. So more of them end up doing it. \u000a\u000a&gt; Do you mind if a band writes one or two songs for radio exposure, but overall sticks to their original sound?\u000a\u000aI'd rather they don't, but nobody really buys music anymore and I fully support doing whatever you can (as long as you're not just straight up hurting people) to make a profit. So, if that's what a band wants to do. I'd rather them just make what they want to. It'll end up better music that way. Look at Demon Hunter's poppier tracks, they're still pretty good. \u000a\u000aHonestly though. I'm fine with pop music, and bands becoming poppier is fine. Unfortunately it's usually not just poppier, it's also really watered down. Look at As I Lay Dying. Awakened is their poppiest record, but it's their best imo. Or Darkest Hour, their newest was my metalcore AOTY last year and it was super poppy.
p9522
aV&gt;One one hand it brings in new fans, new revenue, and more interest in the genre. On the other hand, labels and bands see that becoming more radio friendly make more money.\u000a\u000aI think this can be good for labels as well because the money they get from more "mainstream" bands can then be used to help bands that are heavier and more technical, but not as appealing to broader "radio" audiences. \u000a\u000a&gt; I fully support doing whatever you can (as long as you're not just straight up hurting people) to make a profit.\u000a\u000aI think writing one or two songs for the radio isn't a terrible thing, as long as they're good songs. Metalcore in itself isn't just some "cash grab", a lot of artists struggle to make ends meet, so writing some softer/rockier sounding songs to help bring in more money/fans can be a good thing.\u000a\u000aWith OM&amp;M's new song, the song itself isn't a bad song. It's catchy, and honestly I think the verse guitar parts are pretty cool, even if it's not super techy. It's just sort of disappointing that it's coming from a band that established themselves as a great metalcore band in their early days. 
p9523
aV&gt;I think this can be good for labels as well because the money they get from more "mainstream" bands can then be used to help bands that are heavier and more technical, but not as appealing to broader "radio" audiences.\u000a\u000aLike Sumerian with AA and stuff like BOO. \u000a\u000a&gt;I think writing one or two songs for the radio isn't a terrible thing, as long as they're good songs.\u000a\u000aIt honestly depends on the band and quality of the song. The Dillinger Escape Plan has a really poppy, radio friendly track. And it's fucking amazing (the song is [Black Bubblegum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqXVBeEuwLU). \u000a\u000a&gt; Metalcore in itself isn't just some "cash grab", a lot of artists struggle to make ends meet, so writing some softer/rockier sounding songs to help bring in more money/fans can be a good thing.\u000a\u000aDefinitely. The reason I say I'd rather they didn't is purely selfish wanting less songs I don't care for. Because most of the time, those tracks do end up pretty meh. \u000a\u000a&gt;With OM&amp;M's new song, the song itself isn't a bad song.\u000a\u000aIf it's the broken generation one, I've gotta disagree. I thought it was pretty boring. But it wasn't worse than anything on Restoring Force. I think they could have pulled off something really poppy if they still had Shayley. \u000a\u000a&gt; It's just sort of disappointing that it's coming from a band that established themselves as a great metalcore band in their early days.\u000a\u000aI don't care for them as much as I used to, but yeah. Their first album was one of the albums that got me into the genre. \u000a\u000a
p9524
aV&gt;black bubblegum\u000a\u000aThis I agree with, but at the same time I wouldn't say they are selling out with that song, just a small change in the album adding diversification
p9525
aVBecoming radio friendly =/= selling out. \u000a\u000a
p9526
aVI know that, I was just trying to state that despite this song being catchier/poppier than most of their other stuff it doesn't mean they aren't selling out.\u000a\u000aThe way I worded it,, may have been the reason for the mix up
p9527
aV&gt; despite this song being catchier/poppier than most of their other stuff it doesn't mean they aren't selling out.\u000a\u000aAren't was meant to be an are here, right?

aVShit yeah it was meant to be an are, thanks for the correction just a bit tired
p9529
aVNp. I made like, six typos in my initial reply that I went back and fixed. \u000a\u000aWe agree on it then?

p9533
aVIt really depends if the transition is forced ala Of Mice and Men or a natural progression, ala Bring me the Horizon. One is obviously a forced switch in order to get more money, while the other comes off like natural progression, rather than an immediate switch.

aVI think its bad for the genre on the whole, as I can see that there 'd be  more and more generic bands try to copy this radio friendly sound  and metalcore will get bigger but it'd only be a few bands and then there would be heaps of shitty knock offs. Also I think if there was a lot being played on the radio, metalcore fans would say its a different genre as they wouldn't want to be associated with these new bands and we'd get some new stupid genre.\u000a\u000aThat being said I think its fine for a band to change up their style if it doesn't for commercialisation, there are plenty of good examples of this , such as Converge , The Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die, La Dispute and many others have changed their sound plenty over their careers , sometimes for the worse but I still enjoy it as it was done in a creative way instead of trying appeal to the radio.\u000a\u000aI apologize now for any spelling or grammar errors as I'm on my phone

aVIt's very much a positive thing in the sense that it brings more exposure to the genre. Sure, may some people not like new WCAR as much as old WCAR? Sure. But if it introduces new people into the genre, and those people branch out, and discover other bands, and the genres as a whole grows bigger, and bands are able to do better financially, then that's great.\u000a\u000aAlso, I think the whole term "radio-friendly" is questionable. Some people use it to mean that the integrity of the music is taken out, simply to make more money, while others use it to refer to the music just becoming more simple, or more "catchy", or both. And most people, especially when it comes to heavier music, use it with a negative connotation, but it's not always that black/white\u000a\u000aTo get back on track a little bit, overall I think it's a good thing. At the end of the day, I would rather have bands like ADTR/WCAR/OM&amp;M become more popular then continue having the radio put out the same shit over and over.
p9537
aVI feel it really depends. When a band tweaks their sound for a more radio friendly fit it's obviously meant to help them get more out there. And I feel that's not a bad thing who doesn't want to be more noticed in the music industry. The problem comes when the tweaks overshadow the band's music style, the best example that comes to mind is Of Mice &amp; Men they've tweaked the sound to the point where I thought most the songs off of RF sounded like a Three Days Grace/Linkin Park wannabe band they're sounding less like themselves and more like a *insert rock band here* on a movie soundtrack. So it's not inherently bad just don't let it take control and of course they should know that it will distance a lot of their original fans.
p9538
aVWhat I do is stop listening to them. Simple as that. We came as romans, miss may i, memphis may fire are all bands that I listened to before.

VTo be honest, my least favorite band on the Frozen Flame tour, but that's not saying much! These guys do go hard, especially their old stuff. Maybe they'll change my mind on Saturday
p9548
aVI had the same opinion but they killed it on the frozen flame tour. I saw them in Sacramento and they really brought the energy 
p9549
aVI've seen live videos and I do think I'll enjoy them live. Can't wait!
p9550
aVHaven't seen them since they toured with TDWP and don't like any of their stuff past Monuments but I saw them at Sac as well and they really got me into it. My friend told me Levis vocals were in the way out but he sounded really good. And  I loved that they threw in some older songs as well. 
p9551
aVYeah I have pretty much the same opinion about them. I went with the idea in my mind that I was just going to get in the pit a bunch for their set and have as much fun as possible. I thought Levi did a good job on the vocals too, overall it was super fun 
p9552
aVI think you'll enjoy their set, they sound great live and they play a lot of their older stuff on this tour
p9553
aVYeah I think I'm going to like it too. I listened to some of the newest album and thought the production was horrendous, but I like Apologies... a lot. I'm really excited this is my 2nd time seeing August Burns Red and I LOVE Northlane and Erra so this is a great tour for me. 
p9554
aVThey play 2 songs from the new album, 1 from At Heart, 3 from Monument, and 2 from Apologies. Monument is my favorite from them, so I was pretty happy with that
p9555
aVI felt the same way before I saw them, and my mind was totally changed. I was really surprised at how good they sounded and the amount of energy the had. 
p9556
aVThey were great when I saw them, and to be honest I don't like any of their albums at all. I enjoy one or two songs by them on CD, but live it's definitely a different experience.
p9557
aVman, this album was the BOMB, but the dropped the ball big time on the new album, especially the screams, absolutely HORRIBLE.
p9558
aVWhile I liked this album more, I actually thought the new album was pretty good. Sure, the screams weren't the best, but I enjoyed the album overall
p9559
aVSaw them last night on the Frozen Flame Tour, they killed it. On a side note, whoever did the sound engineering for ABR needs to be shot. Vocals were way too low and lead guitar way too high.

p9564
aVAgreed. They were my favorite band for a long time too.
p9565
aVOh cool they got Austin singing now. Does this mean Aaron can leave and get back to Jamie's Elsewhere or another good band?\u000a\u000aI'm not really impressed by this track. It sort of sounds like a boring Linking Park song.
p9566
aVI was really hoping they added Aaron so that they would kick out Austin and have Aaron do all vocals. But alas, those dreams were too daring. 
p9567
aVLol a man can dream. Aaron is obviously not *cute* enough to be their frontman. Let's ignore the fact that he's a way better vocalist.
p9568
aVSadly that's exactly why Austin is in the band. I do like the new vocalist for Jamie's Elsewhere though, so I'm glad that band is at least still good. 
p9569
aVThe singer of Jamie's elsewhere s latest album got kicked out. No statement but Justin posted a message on his own Facebook. I love em, but I doubt they will find a fifth singer...
p9570
aVWhat did his message say? His vocals were so good on Rebel/Revive!
p9571
aVThey are basically broken up. There has been no statement about it, but I guess he (Kyle, the vocalist) had to finish a tour by himself and then they kinda all just disappeared.\u000a\u000ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie%27s_Elsewhere#Rebel-Revive_and_Kyle.27s_Departure_.282012-present.29
p9572
aVHe'd separated from the rest of the band
p9573
aVReally? When did this happen?\u000a\u000aEdit: Just looked at their Facebook, and yeah he's not even listed anymore on there. 
p9574
aVI'm pretty sure they didn't even finish the rebel revive tour..
p9575
aVUghhhh that breaks my heart a little 
p9576
aVI'm not sure about that, considering that Austin basically started the band in the first place. And IMO Austin used to have some bad ass screams and was one of my favorite vocalists. I think its time we stop considering this band metalcore though, they took a route similar to A7X except with worse songs.
p9577
aVI mean, he did, but they did bring him back to the band after public problems with him. It makes me think that they were just going for the name brand with him. 
p9578
aVThey could have. But I think a lot of the reason he was gone in the first place was his heart problems. They also did write one more kick ass album after they brought him back.
p9579
aVWe also know some of his heart stuff was over played. And I agree The Flood was great, but one has to wonder how much Shayley had written of that before Austin came back. 
p9580
aVGreat point, I really really liked Shayleys voice and it seems that he had a huge part to do with the writing process also.
p9581
aVYeah, idk. It just seems odd that they went from literally letting someone stand on stage during their sets and being like "Fuck Austin!" To welcoming him back with open arms...just smells like a money grab.
p9582
aVYeah they are still pretty good, though not as good as they were.
p9583
aVI just think of them as separate bands almost. They Said a Storm Was Coming is one of my favorite albums ever, so I knew there was no way they could probably come close to that. But Rebel/Revive is just a fun time. 
p9584
aVI mean at this point, its just radio rock. Still, it's nice to hear a band from this scene make it like that. \u000a\u000aDayshell is still better. 
p9585
aVSo boring... lost all hope for this band.\u000a
p9586
aVI tried to like this song. I really did. But fuck is it ever a let down knowing that this band completely abandoned their roots to move towards a more mainstream sound. Also it sounded a lot like seether
p9587
aVI think Austin has been spending too much time with Chester Bennington...
p9588
aVlol I found it weird enough how they got into a set with Linkin Park. Two different worlds merged in a concert. \u000a\u000aWho honestly went to those concerts to see OMM? A mere 0.1% xD 
p9589
aVYeah, I wanted to go, but then saw the ticket prices. Unreasonably expensive, honestly. I can wait for Warped.\u000a\u000aThough I did see them at a very small venue in Tokyo, and they were amazing, but this was pre Resorting Force days...
p9590
aVgood ol' days with Shayley.. I'm jealous you had the opportunity to see them before his departure
p9591

aVWell, this was pretty much exactly what I expected. 
p9593
aVThe message this song is preaching is some pretty low hanging fruit..."guiseee todays generation uses their phones too much." 
p9594
aVwho knew that Austin "Fucking Idiot" Carlile had nothing at all to say about the world worth taking even remotely seriously?\u000a\u000aWith songs like "You're Not Alone" and "Still YDG'n", it's amazing he isn't rated as one of the best lyricists of our age...
p9595
aVBased Carlile please sing me to sleep &lt;3
p9596
aVThis isn't metalcore. This is alternative rock. And it's terrible, boring, cookie-cutter alternative rock at that..
p9597
aVLmao this is fucking hilarious 
p9598
aVLol this sounds like edgy radio rock. And the symbolism in the video makes me sick, so ham-fisted.
p9599
aVOf Mice was always headed in this direction and, unfortunately, Pauley just hasn't soothed that burn...\u000a\u000a\u000aI respect Aaron as a singer but his voice just fails to make me feel *anything*...\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBoring, predictable video that's been done a dozen times before, too.
p9600
aVI loved Aaron in Jamie's Elsewhere, but I haven't been a huge fan of OM&amp;M in general lately (as I'm sure most others feel as well). He's a great vocalist, but I don't like him with Austin.
p9601
aVRemember when Of Mice And Men was good? Pepperidge Farms remembers.

aVIt's better than the first one I heard, which isn't really saying much. I still just think that there's nothing to keep me listening, it just sounds so bland and boring to me.
p9606
aVDisappointing. \u000a\u000aSounds like something that would be in the next WWE game.

aVNHL 2016 all over this

p9609
aVwah wah wah
p9610
aVWell much better than the other song, but still eh.
p9611
aVThis actually wasnt so bad, considering the god awful title.
p9612
aVI was thoroughly surprised at how much I enjoyed it over the entire RF album. May not pass up the other extra songs since this one blindsided me a bit.
p9613
aVThat's exactly what I was thinking, but if I weigh out this one song versus the whole album, then I don't know if the rest are worth listening to. 
p9614
aVYou're joking right?
p9615
aVNot at all, actually. Sure it's not what they used to be, and that is really disappointing, but if you don't compare it to their old stuff, it's decent nu metal radio rock. 
p9616
aVThis is definitely not nu metal. Don't get nu metal mixed up with "sounds like Linkin Park". Other than that, I agree completely.
p9617
aVWhen did Of Mice &amp; Men become Sleepwave?
p9618
aVI was freaked out by the beginning, I was like "who the hell is this". Didn't think it was that good. I kind of stopped liking Of Mice &amp; Men after the re-release of The Flood.
p9619
aVIt's a lot different from their other songs, but over all I enjoyed it.
p9620
aV7 upvotes, 58 comments. It's clear that they aren't metalcore anymore; they're only posted here because they USED to be and people enjoy talking about OM&amp;M and their change. If The Ghost Inside can't be posted here, this really shouldn't be able to.
p9621
aVi like it. I dig the numetal/alternative sound
p9622
aVAm I the only one who really liked this? Compared to the rest of the stuff on Restoring Force I think this is a great step in the right direction. Sure, a little radio friendly, but that's not even a bad thing.
p9623
aVI like this a lot. I'm a big of Breaking Benjamin/Red so this is great.\u000a\u000aThat being said, and considering how this band started, this song would have probably been better received by some had this band started with music like this, instead of transitioning to it.\u000a\u000aBut for what it is, this song is great.
p9624
aV[deleted]
p9625
aVShit, I just posted this. My baaaad.
p9626
aVSure, this is hardly metalcore, but I didn't think it was all that bad for what it is, which is, not metalcore. 
p9627
aVSome people are saying this is a progression to their sound. I disagree. This is just a disappointment. It isn't really "progression" when this sounds generally the same as their latest album and any other Breaking Benjamin-esque band out there. Just my opinion. 
p9628
aVI knew I wasn't gonna like this song, but a little piece of me wanted to love it so bad. Of Mice &amp; Men used to be so good. It's such a shame. 
p9629
aVI feel like somewhere along the way this band lost me. \u000aI still consider myself a fan, sort of, and I enjoyed Restoring Force for what it was, but I have no idea when that transition from decent scenecore band to early 2000's radio rock happened. What clicked in them to make that move, and why has it been so well received? \u000a\u000aOn top of that, when did they get so many Tumblr fangirls? Was it always a thing? Oh well, what're you gonna do. I hardly consider them a metalcore band at this point, but props to them for finding this level of success.
p9630
aVMy life has now been saved.
p9631
aVWhy can't nu-metal and 'hard rock' just die forever?

p9642
aVNot really. 
p9643
aVI can see that now haha
p9644
aVChange is good only when it's for the better. In this case it isn't IMO.
p9645
aVWhat do you mean by "for the better?" For the better of the listener, or the artists?
p9646
aVAlmost two week old post, but ok. I meant that they haven't changed to a better sound, but a worse one. 
p9647
aVAre you really calling me out for a comment on something two weeks old? What does that have to do with anything? Also you didn't really answer my question. You say they have a worse sound now, that's your opinion, totally legitimate. What about the band though? Maybe they, the artists, prefer this sound now, and it's better for them.
p9648
aVI don't really care if their new sound is what they prefer or not. I don't like it myself, therefore I won't listen to it.
p9649
aVThe problem is that there *is* no progression though. Just because a band isn't cookie cutting with breakdowns doesn't mean that they aren't doing that with other sounds. 
p9650
aVcreative.... 
p9651
aVEh it's okay better than most the shit on Restoring Force but still pretty boring. Did like the chorus and bridge though.

I love this song to death, but the lyrics sound like they were written by some ill-informed liberal college student who thinks its edgy and cool to point out false cases of corruption.

aVI will probably end up doing that, just thought I'd post here first. :) Thank you!\u000a
p9778
aVTbh, theyre kind of assholes. Fronz especially. Warped last year my girlfriend and I wanted to meet him at his clothing tent, so we stopped in just to see what they had. Fronz saw that my girlfriend had a sharpie poking out of the pocket in her shorts and said "Im not signing any autographs today unless you bought a ticket" and tried to shoo us away. Ticket was $10... just for an autograph from a cheesy ass band member whose lyrics are so generic and has a failed rap album. Lost all respect for him and their band at that moment. She only had the sharpie in her pocket from Ice Nine Kills and The Word Alive meet and greet. Spencer from IX was probably the coolest dude there. Asked us how our day was and who our favorite bands were. Telle from TWA was pretty cool too. Shook my hand and made eye contact with every single person he talked to unlike Fronz who seemed like he was there just to sell shit and get back to the tour bus to smoke more weed. Good luck though!
p9779
aV"I lost respect for a band because the vocalist didn't fellate me."\u000a\u000aI hate this fucking scene so badly.\u000a\u000aOn topic, though; OP, contact their manager. The metalcore subreddit is about the worst place to go for contacting bands, as I doubt any of them but Christ Rubey from Devil Wears Prada actively browse here. Best of luck.

aVI'm sorry to hear that! We met them last summer at Warped as well, he seemed rushed but was very polite to us and we couldn't take pictures, which wasn't their choice. However when we met them at the signing (which was free) they took all the time to talk to us and sign whatever we wanted. Really nice, genuine guys from what we saw!

p9787
(lp9788
VSongs alright but I'm not a fan of the production.
p9789
aVI kinda....like it 
p9790
aVDropped the mathcore sound, sounds straight bland nu metal to me with some experimental parts. Disappointed.
p9791
aVmathcore sound? what? haha
p9792
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathcore
p9793
aVI'm aware of what mathcore is, just don't really think that Sworn In fits the bill. \u000a\u000a
p9794
aVThey actually had some decently technical stuff. 
p9795
aVIMO mathcore is a bit more than technicality, it has a relatively unique sound and uses time signatures that aren't 4/4. A lot of Sworn In has parts that have a weird feel but are still 4/4. I guess I can see why someone would think that they're mathcore, but I would say that they're wrong.\u000a\u000aAs an aside I'm both a huge fan of mathcore and Sworn In, so I'm not trying to denigrade them.
p9796
aVYeah, when I think of mathcore I think of old Dillinger. 
p9797
aVNothing was as technical as when they were known as Buried by the Ocean. Actually would've been decent if they reworked it a bit
p9798
aVTheir second EP, Start/End was definitely mathcore. That album is pure beauty as well
p9799
aVI don't know man, I love Sworn In. They satisfy 14 year old emo me and 19 year old me. The breakdowns, the vox especially, and the negativity are all fucking awesome. also Tyler Dennen is one of the nicest people I've ever met, and he likes MCR as much as I do so that's cool too. I own 3 sworn in t-shirts fuck me

p9820
aVWhy do people like this band again? \u000a\u000aThe sound was about generic as you can get. 
p9821
aVI'm curious who you think this sounds like. The only thing that sounds similar to this that I can think of is the new Barrier, kind of.\u000a\u000a
p9822
aVGift Giver. Most of those Chicago bands have that nu metal sound in them \u000a\u000aEdit: not defending him saying they're generic
p9823
aVThis doesn't sound like Barrier at all, that's offensive to their sound, if it were a person, it would tear you a new asshole for saying something so ignorant
p9824
aVBecause music is subjective? 
p9825
aVObviously, but the question was aimed towards people who do so I can get an understanding the redeeming values this band has. 
p9826
aVWell, before they had more of a mathcore sound with some nu metal mixed in there, which I happened to enjoy. This song isn't anywhere as good as their last album and is more nu metal and less mathy, but the vocals have improved. Idk man I just like this band. 
p9827
aVGeneric? huh [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e23E45QUWrE). [Not at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GX57vNH_3w). And Sunshine (this new track) is also a good example, it's not generic but it's just boring for the most part unfortunately, unlike their other stuff.

VSaw unearth in a basement in Bakersfield in 2003-2004ish (Jerry's pizza). They actually played amazing! But, this Fuckin guy in the pit. So God damn sweaty with no shirt on and dreads all the way to his ass, I mean to each his own that's cool and it's your style but this guy was alllllllll over the pit. Multiple times I was either hit in the face by his dreads which smelled like you walked into an old musty house that hadn't been inhabited since the early 1800's. A few other times his arm/body was violently slammed/pushed into me... You know that part on the movie Along Came Polly, with Ben Stiller, where he's playing basketball and the sweaty guy gets all up in his face? [Yeah this fucking part right here,](http://media0.giphy.com/media/CSHgKfTzp2lCo/200.gif) that happened multiple times. This Fuck smelled like he hadn't showered in weeks. So, instead of watching unearth absolutely destroy their vicious solos and awesome breakdowns, I spent a majority of my time pushing this homeless smelling Fuck away from me. I'm all for going wild in pits, don't get me wrong. But Jesus Christ at least have some proper hygiene God damn it.
p9890
aVI went to Asking Alexandria's headliner a couple of months ago mostly to see Blessthefall. Blessthefall killed it, but when Asking Alexandria played, Danny was a drunk mess and couldn't even sing or scream properly, and also kept changing the lyrics to the songs. I also heard from someone else there that he kept trying to get girls in the front row to suck his dick. The one good thing about this was that after a few songs, I decided to leave, and ended up meeting Elliot from Blessthefall on the way out, and had a good conversation with him
p9891
aVNot MY experience but I was at an A7X concert standing in line for merch and a girl walked by bleeding from the back of her head saying that some dude was first bumping with a spiked bracelet behind her and repeatedly hit her with it.
p9892
aVWTF? At every show I've ever been to, they either confiscate those kinds of things or won't let you in until you get rid of them. I've been to, I don't know, maybe 10-15 large shows? I guess that one slipped through.
p9893
aV[deleted]
p9894
aVI saw Trivium open for Volbeat. I saw Trivium a few times before and they were excellent but this show was just miserable. The crowd was pretty much all old enough to be my parents and they didn't even pretend to give a damn about the opening band. Matt kept trying to get the crowd involved and literally gave up before the end of their set.
p9895
aVSome drunk chick passed THE FUCK OUT right on top of me and my friend. She was walking out of the crowd and she just stops right between my friend and I. Then she was down. We tried to catch her, however, a 26 year old "bigger" girl is hard to hold onto when its dead weight for two 18 year olds. We just kinda held her there for a sec and then this huge bouncer came over and picked her ass up and got her out of there. Very strange experience because her bf was like "BABE CMON WE GOTTA GO- OH SHIT". At least Dayschell was pretty good lol 
p9896
aVMy first ever concert was Trivium/Coheed and Cambria/Slipknot.  I was so excited.  I had been counting down the days for months.  I went with a good friend of mine who I also worked with.  Since it was my first show I was pretty nervous/anxious.  It was November I believe so it was cold.  I wore a jacket, but quickly realized once I got inside that there was nowhere to put that jacket and I certainly wasn't going to need it anymore... so I decided my only option was to just drape it over my shoulders and carry it.  Kind of annoying, but not a huge deal.  Until Matt from Trivium during the first song says "When we get to such and such part of this song, I want this place to FUCKING ERUPT!" or something along those lines.  And when he did, it was kind of like a movie.  Everything started moving in slow-motion as everyone turned around to see what they were dealing with.  So the part comes along, and since my arms are holding my jacket I find myself immediately on the floor.  It's hard to keep traction when you have no balance on top of spilled beer and popcorn literally covering the floor.  Someone offered me a hand to get up thankfully, however I noticed I lost one of my shoes.  I had to swim through a sea of legs and fight to get it back.  I could hardly breathe because there was so much pot smoke in the air (no offense to stoners/smokers) and I was just not having a good time.  So I opted out to sitting up in the stadium seats for the rest of the show after paying $4 for a bottle of water that had to be poured into a cup.  Aside from all that, all 3 bands were amazing and put on a hell of a show.  
p9897
aVI saw TAIM and I Declare War at chain reaction and ended up getting a concussion. I Declare War demanded the lights get turned off while everyone moshed/hxc danced to make everything more extreme. Before I knew it I got my head slammed by a fist and got knocked the fuck out. Ended up with a huge gash on my head. Still had a great time but it seriously hurt.

aVLiterally two days ago. The Frozen Flame tour in Milwaukee at The Rave. First off let me say it's not because of the bands the show was fantastic. It had to do with security at the place. They were posted up right in the middle of the pit the whole show. Ip there was a solid 7-8 of them right in the middle shutting every thing down. They were the types of dude who go home and beat off to Muscle Fitness with a needle in their ass. Throughout the show the would just be pushing kids, choke holds, kicking kids out for jumping and having a good time. Well during ABR their total fucking douche nozzle boss comes out and puts a kids who had to be 30-35 years his junior. That seemed to be the final straw with just about everyone. Me and about 5 other kids jumped on the guy. That kinda put an end to the chokes but not a end to the useless shoving and total asshole shit they did all night. Oh, I forgot about the guy who wanted to kick me out for not watching my elbows while he had his hands on me. So if you live anywhere around there never go trust me you'll have a terrible time being bullied by security and paying $6 fucking 50 for a can of monster at a all cash bar. 
p9900
aVI was there and up in the balcony! The security was bullshit. I saw one of my buddy's in the crowd getting man handled just for rocking out and having a good time. Horrible new policy or whatever it is. 
p9901
aVI was talking to one of them about why and apparently they have like 40 million in lawsuits and the city wants to shut it down. I immediately was like why the fuck are you guys booking this then?
p9902
aVAh man, that kind of sucks though because outside of the metal grill the rave is all we got in the area. You hardly see anymore shows around Madison and if you're further north there is like almost no shows.  
p9903
aVHonestly, I much rather not have shows that do that again. It's not worth it. Straight up I advise not going there anymore. The only reason I went is because there was no Chicago date. It seems like Chicago is hell of a lot more relaxed. The house of blues in Chicago is one of the best places to see a show hands down. Security are some of the nicest guys who I have come across.
p9904
aVHaha wow! I had no idea they had that many lawsuits but I'm guessing they only do that for shows where they know there'll be moshing because I was at Manson last night and there weren't any guards in the crowd. It was also upstairs in the ballroom though.

aVThis may come as a surprise, but Korn. They were co-headling with Disturbed, who were awesome by the way. This was just before Disturbed went on hiatus. People started leaving after Korn's first few songs because they were just terrible. Then, the lead vocalist got mad at the audience because we weren't being "energetic enough". He was really pulling some Ronnie Radke-esque stage attitude that day. I left after that. 
p9908
aVAbout 6 years ago I saw Daughtry (I was 13 so cut me some slack) and I was really into it and all- I still only listened to what was popular on the radio at this time, hence why I was at this show. So I'm singing these songs pretty hard and having a great time until this lady in front of me turns around and LOSES HER SHIT because I "spit in her face" while singing.\u000a\u000aIn my defense I generate a ridiculous amount of saliva and I've apologized numerous times to people at shows for accidentally spitting on them, but this lady was not having it.\u000a\u000aJust imagine being at any kind of show and seeing a middle aged woman SCREAMING at a 13 year old boy. I guess shitty music just attracts shitty fans.
p9909
aVFront barrier at Enter Shikari, chipped my two front teeth on the barrier due to crowd surfers 30 mins into their set.
p9910
aVDude that fucking sucks. 
p9911
aVMe &amp; a friend went to see Chvrches live a few months back. \u000a\u000aThe gig itself was great, Chvrches was awesome. But the crowd was kinda 'Meh' compared to most gig i went to. That kinda killed it for me. There was one guy beside us who did not move an inch throughout the concert. He just stood there like a plank while everyone was jumping around.\u000a\u000aI have not been to a metalcore concert before, but i would want to in a near future.
p9912
aVChvrches are amazing! I am surprised anyone could stand still during one of their sets, their music makes you want to move.
p9913
aVExactly! Also, I'm surprised there's someone else at this subreddit that listens to Chvrches. You're awesome!
p9914
aVSaw ETID and Acacia Strain. After the show, I accidentally bumped into this dude. He was obviously drunk, but made several racist remarks to me and threatened to fight. That ruined a pretty alright show, but I'm fortunate that most other shows have been great.
p9915
aVThis is my worst and its not at all bad, I was just at alt rock/ fuzz rock gig and there was like 50 people inside and for some strange reason there was this guy with a bandana who took the pit too far and was trying to hurt people, and eventually it lead to me getting whacked hard in the head and feeling dazed for awhile. If this was at a hardcore show I wouldn't mind too much but he was far too hateful, especially for the type of music.\u000a\u000aOther one would be almost passing out at the La Dispute concert due to dehydration, as I was jamming to Balance and Composure before their set I picked up a sweat and I couldn't last the whole night so I went from pretty much the front to sitting in the back drinking to get my sight back haha
p9916
aVI've been crowdkilled a few times, but nothing really really bad.
p9917
aVMine was Bon Jovi a few years back at Soldier Field in Chicago, he started "Living on a Prayer" too early and he just looked down and walked away.  The entire stadium had a collective cringe.  I felt bad for the guy.

aVBro I think your link fucked up. That wasn't a metalcore song that's the audio of a meth head with throat cancer raping a baby goat
p9932
aVFunny cunt
p9933
aVI don't really know what you mean by that, but I'd guess...\u000a\u000aIf you meant immensely popular song that everyone who listens to the genre could recognize in seconds, I'd say either [Carrion by PWD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNvOVey0MSs), or [Unholy Confessions by Avenged Sevenfold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-QaFWURsMU).\u000a\u000aIf you meant a song that could be used to define Metalcore, I could say either something by the early Metalliic Hardcore bands, like Converge probably, but I would lean towards something like [Back Burner by ABR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SrQQJMuVfg), because it showcases everything from pre-generic age Metalcore: riff-based songwriting, non repeating song structure, and, of course, a balls heavy breakdown.
p9934
aVTo clear things up, I was meaning like a song that has a nice slow build up that has a lot of smooth transitions into new verses and a powerful ending.
p9935
aVWell in that case I'd say [Marianas Trench by ABR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oADtFkUzfCo).
p9936
aVThis song is such a masterpiece.
p9937
aVTrying to avoid going full jerk, I agree.
p9938
aVIt's what got me into my now favorite band. So beautiful.
p9939
aVDefinitely agree there
p9940
aVThe closest I can think of to something like that is [Rise Inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwuaFR2clD8). 
p9941
aVNot an old song, but my choice would have to be Dyson Sphere - Phinehas.
p9942
aVWild Eyes - PWD
p9943
aVMaybe since its the song that got me into metalcore and the masterpiece of one of the best modern metalcore records ever, Tears Don't Fall by Bullet for my Valentine. \u000a\u000aAlso, since its brand new I wouldn't argue much for it, but in sheer epicness I'd say Omega by Periphery.

p9955
aVwhats their image?\u000a\u000aoh and I agree, really nice song, genius chorus. 
p9956
aVI don't think anyone was saying anything about their image, unless I missed something lol.\u000a\u000aBut I love UTD.  They are incredibly underrated and they deserve way more fans.  They also seem like super laid back dudes.
p9957
aVI hated their old shit. This new album was awesome though I really like the new screamer 
p9958
aVI definitely agree. This album reminds me of Betraying The Martyrs kinda 
p9959
aVAmazing song :) Don't really like their image but amazing song!
p9960
aVImage?  Care to elaborate a bit on that.
p9961
aVSeeing this band live felt like seeing wannabe BVB live.  \u000a\u000aThat's not a good thing.

VNothing sticks out in terms of soundalikes but try While She Sleeps, Every Time I Die, Letlive, Climates, The Color Morale, Stray From The Path.
p9976
aV+1 for The Color Morale. I really don't like the direction they're going. But they're definitely close to how Beartooth sounds. Really angsty vocals now. 
p9977
aVYeah, there's not much like it. Perhaps you might like more hardcore-ish stuff like The Ghost Inside, or Stick to Your Guns? That's part of the draw of Beartooth though, they really are the only ones with that sound. 
p9978
aVWoah, actually Stick to Your Guns seems suprisingly close to BT for me. Thanks dude!:)\u000a
p9979
aVThought you might enjoy! My personal favorite track from them is "Amber." But most of their first couple albums are solid!
p9980
aVHer name is AMBER
p9981
aVI was watching them at Warped '13 with my gf (she's not into hardcore/metalcore that much) but there was no one else really playing. That part kicked in and I just looked at her and she gave a nod of approval and I just tore for the pits. It was a grand time. 
p9982
aVThats actually what I was looking for concidering I didn't think I'm gonna find something , this has its own characteristics besides being similiar to BT which fits my music style well :)
p9983
aVI'm so glad you made this post, I've been going through the same thing where I couldn't find any bands like Beartooth and STYG seems to be the closest thing that I can find. Thanks to you and /u/andreasmiles23
p9984
aVBe sure to check out their new album Disobedient. It's not their greatest work but it is really similar to Beartooth's Disgusting. 
p9985
aVCheck out My Ticket Home's first album. IIRC several members of Beartooth were on that record. 
p9986
aVI think their album Strangers Only would be a good recommendation as well, it's more raw sounding.
p9987
aVIt sounds a bit more nu-metal though. But definitely a good CD. Might have to listen to it again today. 
p9988
aV[deleted]
p9989
aVThe way I understand it, the members that were in My Ticket Home before Beartooth weren't on Stranger's Only. \u000a\u000a
p9990
aVShomo also produced their first EP and first full length.
p9991
aVI saw them last year on tour with Architects up here in Canada. I'm pretty sure they're out repping SO right now but I'm sure they'll put out a new record at some point.
p9992
aVHoly shit, that sounds almost exactly like This Means War 
p9993
aVBut PUKE ROCK!
p9994
aVI asked this in here a while back. Its hard to find anything similar! :(
p9995
aVCaleb collaborated with Tear Out The Heart on their first album, 'Violence', on their excellent crowd track undead anthem. He just produced their second album, 'Dead, Everywhere'. If you're looking for an awesome, talented and passionate up and coming band who is influenced by the Caleb Shomo sound, look no further. \u000a\u000aSource- gigantic fucking Beartooth fan, destroyed my leg for them at warped 2014. 
p9996
aVTheir first EP reminds me a bit of The Chariot at times, you might also like Defeater
p9997
aVwell sylar sounds a tad similiar for me, but the only real soundalike you will find is the last attack attack album and maybe try some things calbe produced like Come The Dawn
p9998
aVDefinitely My Ticket Home, Gideon and Every Time I Die. I would also check out some of the bands Caleb produces. They often have very similar guitar tones and ultimately similar sounding tracks. Come the Dawn, Tear Out The Heart, Sylar (more nu-metal and less punk than Beartooth) and again, My Ticket Home come to mind. 
p9999
aVWell tbh I expected that there will be no perfect match for BT, cuz Caleb's overall acoustics and screams are somewhat unique. From what u guys recommended i find sylar,and come the dawn fair enough. Thanks guys for your tries, guess gonna have to wait for their new album:)\u000a

p10036

p10041
aVTheir first two albums are so amazing. Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what other bands and albums have a similar style to their first two albums?
p10042
aVYou could try Oathbreaker its blackened hardcore and has some long solos no growls though, here are some songs [Glimpse of the unseen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9nXwatgsMs) , [No rest for the weary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGmDl6GQLAU) now listening to it again its not really that close but its worth checking out, its more moody/atmospheric and is female fronted tell me what you think! 
p10043
aVThey lack the keyboard, but [Overcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZG0wwr1Rcs) are somewhat similar.
p10044
aVMetalcore... Post hardcore... Call it whatever but They're Only Chasing Safety still to this day is one of the best albums in this scene imo. From the first song to the very end the album is perfect. Did wonders for underground heavy music as well.
p10045
aVI don't really care for the later underoath tbh, this is one of my favorite albums by them. The last song on this album (cries of the past) is so God damn good.

p10050
aVI've said this so many times. I'm sure Sumerian will do this eventually
p10051
aVIt's weird seeing Periphery in /r/metalcore. I consider them more a long the lines of /r/progmetal (Lots of users over there love Periphery, including myself), but either way... I love Juggernaut.\u000a\u000aWhen Stranger Things first dropped some people were saying that it was dragging on the album after Omega, but I personally loved it. It brought closure to the story. I especially loved how the song switched from a chill intro to a fast intense moment at 1:27.\u000a\u000aAlso, come join us at /r/peripheryband. :D
p10052
aVIt was an awesome story. With the whole wandering below/floating above the haedean seal. 22 faces is my shit though :)

p10072
aVThe thing was them was that they were so simple, yet knew when they could punch you in the throat, or let Shaley sweep you away with his voice. The new music is just bland without any dynamics to it. This album actually has well placed breakdowns and riffs, and doesn't rely to heavy on the opening riff/verse/chorus/post-chorus riff or breakdown/second verse/chorus/breakdown/maybe a solo/repeat chorus/maybe end with a breakdown formula that everyone else uses. I don't mind that formula if it has some dynamics to it or if the band is musically talented enough to keep it sounding fresh. But Restoring Force fails at all of that.

aVThe Jake Luhrs part was the only good thing in the song. And I cant stand the cleans.
p10134
aVThe first time I actually listened to blessthefall was when I went to see ABR at a show on the tour /u/DeadBlessings mentioned.  I thought they were pretty good, but when I got home and looked em up I was actually disappointed.  The cleans were what killed it for me.  It was just too overproduced on the songs I listened to.  The sad part of it is they (the cleans) actually sounded good live.  I can't listen to their studio stuff, but I think I would go see them again. 
p10135
aVYeah, I really don't like over produced vocals. In general they seems kinda generic and the vocalist was too high. It's kind of my problem with most metalcore.

p10147
aVThey all did at least one.  It was pretty great.
p10148
aVbased on what he's posted on facebook, he did 4 songs, all from Messengers.
p10149
aVI was there (made the road trip from Indianapolis).  Ryan did all songs off Messengers.  Levi from Miss May I and the vocalists from Northlane and Erra all got up there.  The crew was taping lyrics to the stomp box after each song.  
p10150
aVThanks for posting!! He sounded great in the song unsurprisingly. I would *love* to see Garrett R. From Silent Planet do an ABR song sometime. \u000a\u000aRyan is a monster though.... Hope Jake feels better tomorrow night when I see them!

p10156
aVThis was a truly great show.  I liked all the supporting bands, but I had great respect for them after they helped abr out.  Levi especially nailed both performances.  Northlane's guy did great things as well.\u000a\u000aAlso, hot blonde I was hitting on, that's my bad.

p10195
aVThey leaked a bunch of band members' nudes
p10196
aVIIRC, Hunter Moore was a key played in a controversy that happened when ADTR played warped. It was something involve ADTR's bassist (Josh I think?) and his ex-gf.\u000a\u000aI don't remember the whole story but it was alleged that Josh was drunk and him and some crew members started throwing beer bottles at his ex-gf or some shit. His website also put up nudes of Josh
p10197
aViirc he also accused their bass player Josh of fucking underage girls. I don't believe it at all considering what a monstrous piece of shit Hunter Moore is but that's another reason why the band hates him I'm sure. 
p10198
aVWouldn't surprise me.\u000a\u000aAh well, Hunter Moore is going to prison, and ADTR is an independent band doing very well for themselves and theyre still making great music. It all ended up ok

aVNiiiice, glad this is over now.

V[D'Addario Baritone Lights](http://www.wwbw.com/D-Addario-EXL158-Light-Baritone-Electric-Guitar-Strings)\u000a\u000aSource: One of my friends toured with them.
p10220
aVHey, I don't mean to be rude but how recently was he touring with them? I'm just not sure how they could pull off the tunings from their new album with only a 62 for the bottom string. I might be wrong though.
p10221
aVHe said in the AMA that he uses like .72 or .74. Drop f# tuning on lost forever/lost together.\u000aProbably these http://www.ernieball.com/products/bass-strings/1984/6-string-baritone-slinky-w-small-ball-end-29-58-scale
p10222
aVThanks mate, I thought I checked the AMA but i must have missed it.
p10223
aVI'm assuming they play in a drop tuning, probably C, right? You'll want a slightly heavier gauge, and some simple intonation fixes. I play in Drop C and some variants, and I get a lot of work out of Ernie Ball Heavy Bottom, Slinky Tops. \u000a\u000aThese are just some educated guesses though. The folks over at /r/guitars are pretty knowledgeable and helpful, so give them a holler!
p10224
aVThey actually play in really odd tunings. The lowest string is tuned down to around G# sometimes even Gb with the rest of the guitar at around C# standard. Its bizarre.
p10225
aVI bought a seven string just to play this kind of shit so I know the guitar isn't getting messed up by the weird tunings. 
p10226
aVI watched in a interview somewhere that Tom left the guitar in the sun and the first string accidently dropped to F#. He knew that Mastodon played some old songs in a similiar tunning so he tried it and liked it.
p10227
aVI know These Colours Don't Run is Drop B with the low B down to a G# or G. I use DR Mega Heavy Strings (.12-.62 gauge) and they sound great for it. 
p10228
aVI get the feeling the bottom string would be a little floppy, though. Is it at all? 
p10229
aVEh, yea a little. I use a Gibson so the scale is kinda short. Ideally you'd want a guitar with at least a 25.5" scale, but its not too terrible.

p10240
aVOh, I'm not trying to be a dick or anything. Was it started somewhere that it was his first time listening to them? 
p10241
aVNot directly, no, but OP was sharing the bands that got introduced to him in his last thread, so you would conclude that. That's cool \u2013 I guess I misread into your comment a bit haha.
p10242
aVThey really are the epitome of a generic band. 
p10243
aVWell I made a mistake, mentioned in the eariel post, that english is not my native language. So to straight up everything i meant:\u000aI know not everyone will find them (bands i mentioned) similiar to BT cuz their style is somewhat unique( BT style is unique), but still think it will make the searching easier:) - Sorry for mistake ;/

aVAfter the Burial tunes extremely low. Particularly their new album.
p10332
aVDrop C# on Pennyweight and Wolf Amongst Ravens  ( \u0361 \u035c\u0296 \u0361)
p10333
aVThat fucking Drop C2 tuning 
p10334
aVI'm pretty sure all of TDWP's Zombie EP and Dead Throne are both Drop B
p10335
aVMammoth is in drop A 
p10336
aVGloom and Assistant to the Regional Manager are in Drop B IIRC
p10337
aVGlass Cloud?
p10338
aVYou know it with those 9 strings on Perfect War Forever 
p10339
aVIn Hearts Wake plays in Drop A as does Fit For A King.
p10340
aVI think architects tune that low but they use 6 string guitars if I'm not mistaken
p10341
aVI think in their last album, most of the songs were in C# standard with the 6th string tuned to G#, and in Gravedigger F#
p10342
aVArchitects use Drop G iirc
p10343
aVKublai Khan, The Acacia Strain
p10344
aVI don't think I've seen it in here but Breakdown of Sanity uses a lot of drop A. So does The Ghost Inside and I think In Hearts Wake. 
p10345
aVSome of BMTH's sempiternal stuff was Drop A. Not heavy, but low. A lot of OM&amp;M's new stuff too. Crown the Empire's new album was mostly drop A# and A.
p10346
aVWhy so low...
p10347
aVIts the new thing.
p10348
aVPretty sure BMTH have always had stuff in A, especially since they used to play deathcore 
p10349
aVTheir song Blacklist is in Drop G. I think most of the other songs on There is a Hell... are in A. 
p10350
aVmost of SS and There is a Hell was drop A#, but definitely with some Drop A. And I think Count Your Blessings was Drop B, but I'm just basing that off of Pray for Plagues, so I could be wrong.
p10351
aVThe Amity Affliction tunes low a lot of the time. 
p10352
aVKublai Khan, Barrier, Code Orange, Villians. 
p10353
asVHas anyone gone to a concert and sat at the bleachers/stands?
p10354
(lp10355
VI went to Mahem over the summer and sat in the bleachers. The bands wanted us to stand up anyways which felt pretty wierd. I would recommend being in the crowd it's much more fun rather than just sitting in the back listening.
p10356
aVI always feel awkward sitting/standing in a seated area at shows. I went to see Rush a couple years ago, and I just wanted to move. Always get in the pit, especially for a band like Issues. You don't want to be hearing "Stingray Affliction" kick in and not be able to just thrash your body around uncontrollably.  
p10357
aVI was in the bleachers at the Air Canada Centre for Rise Against/A Day To Remember.  It kinda sucked.  Always get in the pit when you can.  It might be more expensive but youll have a much better time.  
p10358
aVI've actually seen that combination twice- once in bleachers, and once on the floor. Being on the floor is almost always more fun.
p10359
aVI won the opportunity to see SwS/PtV on their world tour through a local radio station recently. I entered the contest for shits and gigs, I enjoy a few of the band's songs so I figured "why not, can't hurt." Ended up winning so I took my girlfriend with me. We sat up on the balcony for the first three acts, Mallory Knox, PVRIS and Pierce the Veil then went down on the floor for SwS. This was the only time I have *ever* sat at a show, especially a rock concert. I can say in complete confidence, that even in the sea of fan girls, it was more fun watching from the floor and being somewhat involved in the show than it was simply spectating from above. \u000a\u000aBottom line, I have to be on the floor/"pit" level at any form of rock show, regardless of how big of a fan I am of who's playing.
p10360
aVthey're two different experiences. Sitting in the bleachers is a more relaxed show, because you don't get pushed around or anything, but being on the floor is definitely more personal because you get to be more social and the band is right in front of you. I saw Linkin Park from the back of Madison Square Garden and I don't regret it, but I also saw Rise Against on the floor of a stadium which was amazing because of how huge it is.
p10361
aVyeah the tragically hip but a metal or hardcore show? fuck no
p10362
aVI went and saw ABR, MMI, Northlane, FFAK, and Erra on Saturday. I spent 100% of the show in the bar area sitting at a table. I had a great view of the stage and I loved it. I normally spend the whole time getting sweaty in the pit, but I blew out my knee this year skiing so i figured i better play it safe. I was surprised how much more i enjoyed the show being able to actually see everything as apposed to being in the pit. plus i could drink beer the whole time. \u000a\u000athis wont work at every venue though.  
p10363
aVI exclusively stand back and just enjoy the show now when I go to concerts regardless to the venue. I'm just not a fan of being thrashed around anymore. I'll go in the crowd if it's a band I've been waiting years to see or am a giant fan of but other than that I just enjoy it. Really, it's not a bad experience at all.

aVI looked up all the setlists online and made a megaplaylist haha but thank you!
p10390
aVI did the same lol
p10391
aVHmm... I didn't have Alpha Seed on my setlist I made about a month ago, and Our Kings was switched with Tides.  I guess MMI switched things up a little bit mid tour.\u000a\u000aThankfully, I still have a couple weeks until the concert since I haven't really listened to either of them prior to getting my ticket.
p10392
aVdamn when I saw them live this was the set list. you missed out
p10393
aVOh, no, I just found the setlists online early in the tour (late January) and put them into one massive list on Spotify to prepare for the one I'm going to in March.\u000a\u000aI could've worded that better, but I'm glad that I saw this so I can listen to the updated list.  I got the ticket for ABR, and have found myself listening to Erra and Northlane more than ABR recently.
p10394
aVhave fun, the lineup is amazing
p10395
asVTrying to get my boyfriend into metalcore, he likes The Color Morale, Beartooth, and Affiance
p10396
(lp10397
VMy first few bands were:\u000a\u000aA Day To Remember\u000a\u000aOf Mice &amp; Men\u000a\u000aParkway Drive\u000a\u000aThe Amity Affliction (not one of my first bands, but i think it would have been if i'd known them sooner)
p10398
aVShow him Sempiternal and see if he likes it. Otherwise, some ADTR might be a good shot.
p10399
aVBlessthefall is a pretty good introductory band, they're the ones that got me into metalcore
p10400
aVIf he likes TCM and Beartooth then i would recommend to show him some of the more generic stuff like Asking Alexandria, Memphis May Fire and A Day To Remember. Great entry stuff!\u000a\u000aAnd also if he likes bands with more cleans i would show him some SycAmour, they're more post-hardcore but they have som really heavy parts and some amazingly catchy choruses.
p10401
aVMOTHER\u000a\u000aFUCKING \u000a\u000aSYCAMOUR
p10402
aVReal talk though, we need a Sycamour flair :D
p10403
aVHop your sweet ass over to /r/PostHardcore, and your dreams will come true. 
p10404
aVAhh of course, always getting mixed up with all these different sub genres &gt;.&lt;
p10405
aVS'all good, man. 
p10406
aVNothing More.
p10407
aVI would make him listen to stick to your guns. STYG has a nice mix of screaming and clean vocals (especially diamond and disobedient), so it can be great to easy people into heavier vocals.
p10408
aVEvery Time I Die - The Big Dirty or Hot Damn both are fun albums with not too harsh vocals
p10409
aVI think generic things would be good for him. Maybe things like A Day To Remeber, Of Mice and Men, Escape the Fate, Annisokay. \u000a\u000a If he doesnt like screaming I can recommend Polyphia because they dont have any vocals! \u000a\u000aI can recommend Monuments to everyone...
p10410
aVShow him Atreyu's second album The  Curse. [Demonology &amp; Heartache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp8DfzGsxTA) is my favorite from the album. But [Bleeding Mascara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdIJdL-pWIs) is amazing too. \u000a\u000aThat album is legit one of my favorite albums. 
p10411
aVVery first metal core band was Memphis May Fire. Give that a try.
p10412
aVI think he would enjoy Escape the Fate quite a bit but they are post hardcore, one of my favorite all time bands. Their album 'Dying is your Latest Fashion' specifically. Also one of the founding members (Max Green, bass player) has his own band he's starting up called Violent New Breed which I think may be up his alley as well, although they only have two song out at the moment.\u000aHe also enjoy some others:\u000a\u000a-A Day to Remember\u000a\u000a-Attack Attack! (only mention them because it's the same vocalist of Beartooth, Caleb Shomo.)\u000a\u000a-Get Scared (I believe the Best Kind of Mess album, also post hardcore)\u000a\u000a-Memphis May Fire\u000a\u000a-You Me at Six\u000a\u000a-Bring Me The Horizon\u000a\u000aSome of those may not be what kind of thing he is looking for but it may be a start, if anything he may find some songs out of albums he likes quite a bit, and others not. Can't hurt to do a little digging.\u000a
p10413
aVYou Me at Six? That seems like quite a strange recommendation. 
p10414
aVSome of their songs can have clean vocals. She said her bf doesn't like screaming yet he likes BT, and Caleb Shomo is one of the best screamers out there.
p10415
aVIf he likes Beartooth try My Ticket Home's second album, While She Sleeps, The Ghost Inside as well.\u000aAffiance? Try all your old school Gothenburg influenced bands like Killswitch, AILD, All That Remains, Trivium and stuff like that.\u000aThe Color Morale, you'd want stuff with a good balance of vocals and strong riffs, try Like Moths To Flames, In Hearts Wake, Bury Tomorrow, Blessthefall, Hands Like Houses.
p10416
aVMaybe try burden of a day's one one thousand album. It could get him more comfortable with screams :)

p10432
aVYea, that was me. It's amazing! So similar to Monument, brutal and fast. Might add one or two of those to the playlist, but definitely adding the album to my general collection.
p10433
aVAwesome!! Definitely my favorite MMI album. Porcelain Wings and Apologies Are For the Weak are my favorite tracks. 
p10434
aVNot my favorite of theirs, but definitely the best in terms of pure heaviness, my favorite song from it is probably A Dance With Aera Cura

VWould have thought they would have been on Mayhem again rather than warped.\u000a\u000aAren't Miss May I trying for the whole "Defend heavy metal" ethos?\u000aSeems a bit out of place on warped...
p10443
aVWeird since they're not heavy metal at all
p10444
aVBut they're way more influenced by bands like As I Lay Dying and In Flames than bands like The Ghost Inside or The Devil Wears Prada.
p10445
aVWell, admitted they aren't at all.\u000a\u000aBut Levi and the rest of them pride themselves on the whole "Don't let metal die" etc.etc. stuff\u000a\u000aAnd in my opinion thats better suited to mayhem than warped
p10446
aVI know they do, but it's weird seeing as though they've gotten softer with every album they've put out.
p10447
aVIt seems like they're trying to do some of each, in a recent interview, they said they want to play Mayhem, and tour with those sorts of bands, but still also play Warped and tour with those sorts of bands as well
p10448
aVCool

aVWonder when warp will really announce it.\u000aHonestly that's really good news cause so far Warped has pretty much only 3 core bands I really wanna catch.

p10553
aVHey me too! AZ represent 
p10554
aVAw yiss. It was actually my first metalcore show, time to buy more tickets because I had a great time. 
p10555
aVOh wow, nice, glad you enjoyed your first one. I actually got really tired by the end on account of lack of sleep (I work nights), not to mention I got pretty fucked up in the pit during Northlane and Miss May I (lost half my glasses during Scarab, then got ran full force into by a dude 3x my size right in the stomach, wind knocked out of me during Masquerade, plus fending off the goddamn invisible ninja fighters) so by the end during ABR's set, I barely had the energy to jump haha. \u000a\u000aIt was still an awesome show though, and yeah metalcore shows are usually a great time. Depending on what bands you see they tend to be better than that one; there were a lot more moshbros/metalheads there than usual, and less scene girls haha. Pretty sure I only saw girls in the pit for MMI and ABR lol. But yeah the Nile is like my favorite venue, its so fucking nice and its just small enough that you're never crowded and it can be air conditioned well and just big enough that the big name bands in this scene will still tour there. \u000a\u000aIf I may suggest, TDWPs Zombie tour *and* Chelsea Grin's Ashes to Ashes tour are coming on the same day,March 25th. They're opening the Underground and holding both shows in one night, nine bands, tickets are $25. I've actually never been to a deathcore show so it should be fun, I'm buying my ticket as soon as I get paid lol.\u000a\u000aEdit: fuck I need to stop using reddit when I'm high, sorry for the novel.
p10556
aVLol at your edit. I was basically there for ABR so I saved my energy for that, but MMI, ERRA and Fit for a King were really good for bands I didn't even listen to until the show. IMO northlane wasn't that great, I like their songs that are recorded but live I wasn't feelin it. \u000a\u000aBut yeah I'm planning on TDWP, For Today, and ADTR for my next shows, they're all coming up recently. 
p10557
aVReally? Northlane absolutely crushed it, I was impressed, especially with the new vocalist, he fucking killed. I felt Erra had kinda weak stage presence minus their bassist and front man, but I guess they were having trouble with the monitors on stage so whatever. Every band was great though, and I'm glad I went.\u000a\u000aWell sick dude, I'll see you at some upcoming shows then. Well, not that I'll recognize you, but we'll be throwin down in the same room to the same music haha.

aVDefinitely the highlight off MoC. I really enjoy all of the other songs, but this has a certain ass-kicking element to it missing from the other tracks on the EP. Sort of like Hybrid Earth off Augment.

aVIt's been quite some time since I've listened to them. Did they get a new vocalist? The only thing I wasn't a fan of on Nocturne was their clean vocals, but this song is pretty awesome.
p10566
aVI like the cleans on Nocturne and Midheaven the best. Well idk they just fit really well with the sound they had. 
p10567
aVI feel like you either loved or hated those clean vocals. I always loved Travis's screaming in FFTL, so I'm glad he got a frontman gig, however short lived it was

aVThe vocalist is Travis Richter the guitarist/screamer for from first to last.

aVthat's exactly how I feel about this song and their last EP. it's such a generic change in direction, but I guess I still enjoy it. 
p10582
aVIs anyone from the original formation still in there?\u000a\u000aI don't dislike the song, but that type of metalcore sounds so boring to me, really miss their old sound. But oh well, the new one is definitely more "sellable".
p10583
aVFrom the video, it looks like the lead guitarist still is, which seems odd because the riffs were not good on this track in comparison to Caves.

aVMy thoughts exactly!\u000aI'm such a huge fan of their first two EP's, like they are my all time favorite and then just to see this is.... Ehhhhh I'm not gonna talk down on it. I'm glad that they're still around and happily making music, I just don't prefer anything after the EP's though.

aVShit I had no idea they used to sound like this. I got into them after Challenger, I liked that record. I went back and listened to the Hollow a bit too, but not like Challenger. Then Unconditional came out and I lost interest. I never went back to the oldest MMF until this very moment...\u000a\u000a...and hot damn it sounds like Every Time I Die! (see what I did there?) This song is badass! Does the whole record have this southern metal, ETID-feel to it? Or just this track?

aVThis album is with Matty. Their very first EP is the only one without him
p10631
aVShit, I don't. That southern rock influenced stuff sounded cheesy even back then. I think people just want to hype up that early stuff because of how big they've gotten, which is kinda sad. At least nuthug the Hollow if you're going to dickride early Memphis. 
p10632
aVI don't like something and therefore everyone else who does is wrong and just doing it for attention.
p10633
aVObjectively true. They artificially like this sound, they don't genuinely like it. That's why it died out so quickly. 
p10634
aVWay to disregard my opinion. I became a fan of them after listening to Sleepwalking, and I never really got into The Hollow. I really liked the sound they had back then, and The Hollow was a step back into a more generic sound IMO.

But to pretend to be something you're not for all these years just so you could stay in a band? Sorry man, but that is low. \u000a\u000aI think their new vocalist is doing an amazing job, though.
p10741
aVI definitely agree on you about what he did, but the new guy seems out of place to me on some songs. Idk :/
p10742
aVI like you he new guy more personally. It seems like he fits the more raw sound that they are going for as a band, and he sounds great live. 
p10743
aVDefinitely agree with this. While the old singer fit the older material better the new guy definitely fits the new material to a T. Also the drummer has some pretty nice pipes as well(did the vocals for the first album + descendants).
p10744
aVWell clean vocals are definitely a big infleunce for the atmosphere in metalcore songs. So it's normal it still feels and sounds weird to some people. I fell in love with his voice the moment I heard it, though. To each their own of course :)

aVThis whole album is a great example of generic metalcore done *really* well. Love this album.

p10840
aVNot sure what your more picky with grammar, or sub genre's.
p10841
aVI'm picky with grammar because I'm studying to be an English teacher and because it's not difficult to follow simple conventions of the language, and I'm picky with genres because there's a reason the subreddit is called "metalcore". I didn't say that the topic should be removed because Underoath is primarily a metalcore band. That album just happens to be post-hardcore.
p10842
aVI understand that English grammar is very simple, but not everybody who uses reddit is English. Also all these sub genres aren't simple at all and to someone like me who knows nothing about music, they all sound the same.
p10843
aVIf English is not OP's native language, then I'm very sorry for that. But based on the context clues of the rest of the post, intuition would lead me to suspect that English is indeed OP's native language. And understanding the genres is rather simple, and it has been explained to death. Even then, the fact that They're Only Chasing Safety is a post-hardcore album by a metalcore band doesn't mean the topic should get removed, which I said.

(lp10915
VI really hate how some people go out of their way to completely trash a band they don't like. Some bands cater to a certain audience and if you don't like it, don't listen and move on. It's really annoying. I really love that most bands support each other or have some sort of friendship. I see bandmembers interact with each other on Twitter all the time and it's a great sight. It's like they're a united community wishing one another the best. It's great. Oh, yeah and I really fucking like breakdowns.
p10916
aVThis this this this!!!! I absolutely despise that some bands get constantly bashed on.
p10917
aVI feel you. Every comment section on YouTube is a cesspool of hate comments that contribute absolutely nothing.
p10918
aVYeah, that's the reason why I don't even bother reading YouTube comments &amp; try to avoid them most of the time.
p10919
aVI wish I would have understood this a couple years back. Me and my buddies are in your average local rock band and we would play with lots of bands we did not enjoy listening to. We used to sit back and shit talk the entire show and then play our set and think that everyone was probably shit talking us while we were playing.\u000a\u000aNow, even if I'm not a fan of a band's sound or see that they are a bit choppy, I respect that they are out working hard to make it happen. Plus, my band still messes up all the time--I go off time occasionally as a drummer, so who am I to judge? I also know that everyone has to start somewhere and that they'll get better with each show and do their thing. Also, who gives a shit if I don't like their sound? More often than not, those guys are some cool ass people that I love hanging out with after their set.
p10920
aVI think it has to do with the fact we were all young. It seems "cool" to pick on something you don't like. Makes you feel superior, but after a while I think you should grow out of it and let others enjoy their opinion.
p10921
aVI really don't like how many bands are just copying off each other without having any originality. What I like though is how this genre can be really good when bands do interesting and creative things with it
p10922
aVYour positive statement is kinda why I lean more towards deathcore now, a lot of bands are willing to try more diverse sounds and there aren't that many ''generic'' bands
p10923
aVI'm just not really much of a deathcore fan other than Born of Osiris, so I've been leaning towards the more interesting metalcore, bands like August Burns Red, Northlane, Erra, Architects, etc...
p10924
aVwell I'm assuming you've checked them out, but if not, you should give Veil of Maya a listen to, specifically their albums The Common Mans Collapse, id, and Eclipse
p10925
aVI've listened to them a bit, not a huge fan, but some of their stuff is sort of interesting
p10926
aVEclipse saves lives. 
p10927
aVI've hated the homogeneous and overall generic sound that so many bands have had for such a long time, but it seems like experimentation and true progress is finally being made.\u000a\u000aSo, that makes me optimistic about the future.
p10928
aVOne thing that I have loved seeing in the local scene is that there are bands who are playing some of the most abstract and creative things. Yes, there are your cookie cutter bands and some bands do things that are just absurd, but there are bands that hit that in between point and just kill it.\u000a\u000aFor example, I saw [Wolfshark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jHgdfdRYtQ) last night and they were absolutely amazing. Great stage performance, each member is phenomenal at their instrument, their vocalist kills it, and the songwriting is something fresh. I can't even describe how good their drummer is.\u000a\u000aAnyways, call me crazy, but I wouldn't be surprised if every local scene has bands like this. It's really cool.
p10929
aVHate bands that are trying to commercialize/profit off of suicide/depression\u000a\u000aLove bands that aren't trying to commercialize/profit off of suicide/depression
p10930
aVHow do you feel about TAA? They do make   a lot of songs on those topics but outside of their music I don't feel like they thrive on that image. They just seem to party and have fun
p10931
aVI don't really like them that much because their music never really clicked with me, but they seem genuine. With what I know about the circumstances of their band forming, it's kind of hard to not write about those kinds of topics. They don't seem to be doing it as a gimmick.
p10932
aVCoupled with that, I think Joel has suffered a lot in the past from depression, so I guess to him writing song about it is both therapeutic, and can also help explain/console listeners that might be suffering from similar problems.
p10933
aVI think he has talked about this publicly, and how his past experiences influence his music. So I don't really consider them "hopecore".
p10934
aVI see. Thanks for the response man
p10935
aVWhat about bands that write some of their music about suicide and depression, but *aren't* trying to commercialize/profit from it specifically; it's just part of their music.\u000a\u000aLike Moths To Flames comes to mind. Like, their vocalist Chris *actually* suffers from depression. Can he still take inspiration from it, even though they're metalcore? I'd say so.
p10936
aVYes, those bands are fine. I'm specifically talking about your Of Mice &amp; Mens, The Colar Morales, etc. that have made the "have hope, you're not alone" thing a literal gimmick just for them to make money.
p10937
aVAbsolutely agree. For me, that shit got old with MMF's third album.
p10938
aVApparently not, since people shit on The Color Morale even though Garret Rapp has clinical depression. 
p10939
aVHate: Fucking Hopecore. I blame OM&amp;M and TCM for this.\u000a\u000aLove: Concept albums. There are a lot of bands who have worked these great stories into their albums (*Council of the Dead*, *Zombie EP*, the "Johnny Saga" by CTE, and *The Emptiness* to name a few) and I hope that bands keep going with this. It takes a huge amount of skill to pull it off, and it really turns good albums into great albums.
p10940
aVTcm really bothers me because Know Hope seemed incredibly honest. Then every other band started doing it. Then they came out with HOPE or whatever....are you kidding me. 
p10941
aVWhen you literally say "I am your savior" in your song, you may be TCM
p10942
aVHate bands that write material that they can't pull off live.\u000a\u000aLove bands that can pull off their material live.
p10943
aVI think it's one thing to "pull it off" live, and another to not be able to passably perform it. I can think of plenty of bands who are good and entertaining live, but not great. They just kind of "pull it off", rather than take it to the next level. I think that's ok, if your music is complicated as fuck in the studio. 
p10944
aVI agree, but at the very least a band should be able to play/sing their material live. If they can go above and beyond that then that is awesome but its just embarrassing watching some bands play live.
p10945
aVThat's why The Bravery is so great. Sam admits he's not a very talented singer, but he makes his voice work perfectly for their music, and really gives it his all live.
p10946
aVI feel like this with The Color Morale. Garret is absolutely abysmal live. It's actually painful to see. I was really disappointed since I was a big fan back then.
p10947
aVI truly hate unnecessary clean vocals. I'm all for bands doing their own thing and what not, but a lot of metalcore bands I find will often get me pumped up, loving it, everything's getting heavy and what not, then bam clean vocals, most often then not pretty high pitched or pop-esque. Some bands, it fits. But for some, it totally ruins the flow for me, and it seems like they're added only to be be less edgy so more people will listen to them. \u000a\u000aI LOVE concept albums, like someone said earlier. I remember hearing Zombie EP when it was first released like 24/7. I still listen to it all the time. Concept albums are fun as shit to listen to when done right. I pray for the day TDWP releases a Zombie LP or some other off the wall concept album.\u000a
p10948
aVFor me, I love clean vocals but what seperates a good artist from an average one is being able to transition into the cleans but keeping up the intensity.\u000a\u000aI hate when bands have this really epic intro and then they stop playing for like 3 seconds and go into cleans that don't really fit the last segment of the song
p10949
aVI know exactly what you mean. It's a total let down. 
p10950
aVI don't get why cleans have to got to be whiney/nasally as fuck. You could be mistaken that it's just one guy doing the cleans for all metalcore bands, because apart from a few, they all sound the exact same. The only band I can think of where they sound different is Every Time I Die, but I imagine that's because they don't use cleans as a 'backup' vocals, Keith's vocals are always at the forefront.
p10951
aVI hate how anti-old school metal the average metalcore listener is. Sure I like metalcore but I also love metallica and slayer.\u000a\u000aI love the combination of heavy and clean vocals
p10952
aVFor me at least, I love hardcore punk. Which is the genre Metalcore is a derivative of. The "metal" part of "metalcore" is shorthand for the full name of the genre, which is "metallic hardcore". Metalcore isn't truly for metal fans, it's for hardcore fans looking for a little bit of metal thrown in. 
p10953
aVThis x1000. \u000a\u000aI don't specifically care for hardcore "punk" - I dig more traditional hardcore.
p10954
aVHate: When people that don't listen to this genre immediately classify Hardcore/Metalcore as "Satanic" or "Encourages to you kill others &amp; yourself".\u000a\u000aLove: The limitless experimentations that can be done with this genre and how the addition of diferent genres like EDM/RnB somehow works. 
p10955
aVMy friends who don't listen to it always call it "that hate your parents music"
p10956
aVIf I could take away one thing from this genre it would be the money, it's driving bands to cater to the biggest subsection of the population possible. Obviously I want want bands to earn what they deserve, I just don't want it to motivate them to create something that isn't genuine. Currently the genre seems like such a barren wasteland to me. Sure, there are bright spots such as Erra/Periphery/Northlane but you reeeeeally have to dig to find talent nowadays. Post MySpace metalcore has primarily been generic, and bands who pushed the envelope years ago are releasing disappointing albums compared to what they are capable of (I'm looking at you TWA). I just want compelling albums and not a 12 track plea for my money via super edgy breakdowns and cringe including lyrics. 
p10957
aVShitty electronic intro/interlude/outro tracks. I can see why they are used but the majority are boring as hell and take up 2/3 tracks of an 11 track album, which is pretty annoying I think.
p10958
aVChange: whiney clean vocals\u000aKeep: breakdowns. Oh my god the breakdowns.
p10959
aVIf you asked me this a year, or even like 6 months ago, I would have said something like electronica bits, or rapped parts. But now, I kinda see the value in everything. Sometimes there'll be a rap section that turns me off, or an electronica breakdown that I think is dumb, but I 100% want people to keep doing whatever they want. I like variety in my metalcore.\u000a\u000aAnd I see a lot of people saying they dislike the clean vocals, especially if they're whiny. I say, fuck that, I love the pussy ass clean singing. I prefer when bands have it actually. 
p10960
aVFat chicks stage diving.
p10961
aVWhat I hate: The overuse  of breakdowns. The presence of breakdowns themselves are fine, but we don't need one in every song. Much less two or three in the same song. Especially when they're needlessly long. Listen to [Blue 42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0hePNdg4NM) by Haste the Day for an idea of what I'm talking about. The breakdown takes up nearly half the song. Otherwise it's a great song. Now compare it to [An Honest Confession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1xpARRtNKk) from the same album, still a little heavy on the breakdown but it's used much better. Or [The Bloodening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8WSoKzhVfY) which is abouta s close as I can think of to being perfectly balanced. \u000a\u000a_______________________\u000a\u000aWhat I love: Sugary, poppy, clean choruses. Not clean vocals in general, but the "here's the catchy bit you'd hear in a pop song" ones. Like [Gates of Horn and Ivory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urcLhku0I7Y) (my favorite chorus atm) [Balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOIEPrroqsg) by Mutiny Within (the lines in particular here are "raise up my head. rain starts to fall. drops of my conscience soak through my soul. burning alive, just give me this life") [Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKTEk2mhvuU) by It Dies Today, [When Everything Falls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcrepijjLpc) by Haste the Day, or [Fight Your Demons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHsFhRsV4Q) by More Than a Thousand. 
p10962
asVWhat songs would you consider beautiful?
p10963
(lp10964
V["Americans" by This or The Apocalypse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBsP91lRxs) is my personal choice.\u000a\u000aAnd while it's not exactly metalcore, I consider ["Flourish" by The Contortionist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW53D7VvgvI) the most beautiful metal song I've ever heard.
p10965
aVExoplanet is one of my favorite albums of all time! Around 2012 I kind of fell out of the metal loop though, so I haven't heard the two newer albums from The Contortionist yet. I'm kind of worried to check them out as well, since I think it will be tough to top Exoplanet. Are they good?
p10966
aVThere're both great, language is definitely a lot different from exoplanet though.
p10967
aVwe were just kids by emmure  \u000askin and bones by fit for a king  \u000athis is how the wind shifts by silverstein (post hardcore band)  
p10968
aVWe were just kids hits home for me. I love the emotion he puts in it. Best track hands down off the album.\u000a[Emmure - We were just kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOIRJ5N01I8)
p10969
aVI never expected an emmure song to hit me so hard emotionally but it's one of only a few songs that hits my feels that hard!
p10970
aVYou should check out [Rusted Over Wet Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36DXqFBQAZU) as well. It's about losing his child and man does it hit me
p10971
aVI never realized that's what the song was about, I guess I never paid attention to the lyrics that much haha
p10972
aVWhat shall we name him? WHAT SHALL WE NAME OUR DEAD SON!\u000a\u000aMy lip quivers every time I hear that part.
p10973
aV[deleted]
p10974
aVOh how I love Skin and Bones,  as well as the old DTWF by Silverstein. And to think some days I feel alone being part of both Metalcore and Posthardcore, love them.
p10975
aVyour definitely not alone, i think alot of people love both genres :)
p10976
aVNo links because I'm on mobile but\u000a\u000aHeart - Erra\u000aKansas - the Devil Wears Prada\u000aThe Distant Blue - Architects\u000aHospital for Souls - Bring Me the Horizon\u000aVahle/Edge of the Earth- Volumes\u000aThis One's for You/Farewell to Shady Glade - Of Mice &amp; Men\u000a\u000aMost of these probably aren't beautiful in a traditional sense, but the meaning and passion behind them makes them beautiful to me.
p10977
aVpoints for Heart.
p10978
aVI've had Lost Together since it came out and I never got into The Distance Blue until like a week ago when I listened to it and it just hit me how great it was
p10979
aVOne of the only songs to ever leave me speechless, it's fantastic. 
p10980
aVProbably [I Cum Blood by Cannibal Corpse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8gi_yLF8r8).\u000a\u000aJust kidding! I'd say [Beauty in Tragedy by August Burns Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-noYJ459dE).
p10981
aVcannibal corpse saved my lyfe
p10982
aVCannonball Crops confirmed to be the next Of Austin &amp; Carlile.
p10983
aVYes! Beauty in Tragedy is my choice too. Love that song!
p10984
aVI think this is one of the most beautifully crafted songs ever. The second one. That break in the middle of the song along with the buildup right after sends chills down my spine every time. 
p10985
aVBeauty in Tragedy was the first metalcore song I heard and it is amazing(2yearsago).Still can't believe not every metalcore fan knows this song 
p10986
aV[Avenged Sevenfold - So Far Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7ry4cx6HfY)\u000a\u000aIt's about The Rev. For those who are not familiar with the band, that's their late drummer/childhood best friend
p10987
aVI may not be a fan of avenged sevenfold, but this is an amazing song. 
p10988
aVI'm not sure how familiar you are with their discography, but they have quite a few songs that are on the softer, more "emotional" side that aren't your "typical" A7x songs. This is one of them :p
p10989
aVDefinitely. I used to listen to quite a bit of A7X. They were one of my gateway band into metalcore, but now that I've heard other bands I like better, I'm not really a huge fan of them. That being said, I love afterlife, Crimson day, acid rain, seize the day, and save me. 
p10990
aVAll great songs.\u000a\u000aI'm a bit biased because they've been my favorite band since I first discovered them in like 2006 haha.\u000a\u000aThey were also one of the bands that got me into heavier music (along with Blessthefall/BFMV/Atreyu) but they've always been my favorite band, no competition. I don't even put them on the same level as other bands haha.\u000a\u000aTheir diversity, talent as songwriters, and how they act as a band, along with the music itself just hooks me like no other band has :p\u000a\u000aDid you ever listen to the Diamonds in the Rough B-side album?
p10991
aVWhat's funny is the drummer of my favorite band Dream Theater left to be the drummer for your favorite band for one album. I never listened to that album actually. Maybe I just wasn't a huge fan of the hail to the king album. That's about when I stopped listening to them and when I started to listen to stuff like Memphis May Fire, and eventually August Burns Red. I didn't start listening to MMF until about October of last year, and ABR until about January of this year. I'm really new to this genre to be honest 
p10992
aVGood ole Mike Portnoy.\u000a\u000aHe holds a special place with the big A7x fans. He really helped out the band at a time when they needed it. They were incredibly close to breaking up but he stepped up and recorded the drum parts that were already written, as well as putting down some of his own stuff. I have so much respect for him because of that.\u000a\u000aHail To The King is a great album, but its definitely not my favorite  It's very bare bones compared to what they normally sound like, and that was intentional. I hope that their next album has more harmonies/layers like theyre known for. They wanted to prove they could have a bare bones album reminiscent of the old school metal, and they did.\u000a\u000aDiamonds in the Rough is a b-side album from the Self-titled era, and was released along with their live DVD.\u000a\u000aHeres some of my favorites from the album:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7_4Pe9LCZw\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtUpj4sVCDQ\u000a\u000aIf you're still new to the genre, and you like MMF and bands similar to them, checkout blessthefall if you havent already. Theyre my second favorite band :p and are the primary band that got me into post hardcore/metalcore/etc. All of their material is fantastic.
p10993
aVCreative Captivity by August Burns Red
p10994
aVThat song is art :)
p10995
aVSo much this
p10996
aVI'd go with either [Astral Body - Between the Buried and Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRbnY8EK4Ew), or maybe [Children of Fire - Oh, Sleeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-AIn2qjP1A), because dem arpeggios in the chorus. Mmmmm.
p10997
aVI've always considered "Hush Yael" by Oh, Sleeper beautiful. When I read the backstory it sent chills down my spine. 
p10998
aVThat's the song that got me into them. I'm a sucker for intriguing lyrics and a solid backstory.
p10999
aVMe too.
p11000
aV[Adestria - More Than You Know](http://youtu.be/s3v-ty-3yfU)
p11001
aVIf anyone who sees this comment hasn't heard this song, get on it.
p11002
aVI did a research paper about lyrics in metal / PHC / MC songs for college and Adestria was a big part of that. This song's about one of the band member's grandmother.
p11003
aVwait tell me more... what were some of your conclusions?
p11004
aVThe theme over the semester was community, our research paper was our choice on how a specific community used writing, so obviously I picked lyrics in the music I like and how people that aren't into heavy music assume it's gibberish and devil music blah blah blah. Ended up being the professor's favorite paper of my class. Here's a link to it.\u000a\u000ahttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Z3vohjT_-RWnkzNjlBQndQbVE/view?usp=sharing
p11005
aVThat was a good read. thanks for sharing! I can see why it would be the professor's favorite paper in the class. 
p11006
aVThis was my first thought when i read the post, and it was already the top comment.
p11007
aVListened to this about an hour and a half ago (first time listening to Adestria too), and I'm currently on my second play-through of their album Chapters. I'm hooked, thank you. 
p11008
aVSuch an amazing album. Gilded Hearts was good but not as good as Chapters.
p11009
aVAnother Year - Animals as Leaders\u000a\u000aIn Sincerity - For The Fallen Dreams\u000a\u000aJaunt - Sirens and Sailors\u000a\u000a
p11010
aVLove the lick in Another Year
p11011
aVPinned Down and Fisted - Infant Annihilator 
p11012
aVNot as beautiful as Anal Prolapse Suffocation 
p11013
aVA Rose For Epona- Eluveite https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1lXdLus2WI\u000aAlso, any song by ERRA, Alesana, or Epica. Those three bands put out so many melodious and meaningful songs. 
p11014
aVFemale vocals and a violin? Shiiiet. That was amazing. Definitely gonna be listening to more of these guys. Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check out the others too!
p11015
aVI love me some Eluveite\u000a\u000aHeres a song you may like\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w2m-TeLi6I
p11016
aVI am familiar with their whole discography :P. Origins is a cool album. 
p11017
aVOh ok :p
p11018
aVAlso, most of their songs are heavy on the bagpipes! Folk metal is so great. 
p11019
aVHell yes! That song made me tear up when they played it live. 
p11020
aVDefinitely [Marianas Trench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oADtFkUzfCo) by August Burns Red... I find everything about it to be evocative, and that buildup in the beginning feels right, not out of place like it would in so much of the rest of the genre
p11021
aV[The Year Summer Ended In June - Misery Signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XlccGu58Bc)\u000a\u000a
p11022
aVedge of the earth volumes
p11023
aVErased and Across the Bed also get me
p11024
aVI'm terms of metalcore, I think Crucify Me by BMTH is a really amazing sounding song. I also have a soft spot for Sleepwalking, the intro is so spacey and uplifting. Outside of that, I think Sextape by Deftones is truly one of the most beautiful songs ever to grace the earth.
p11025
aV[Ebb and Flow, Misery Signals.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkiU0AHmG8o)\u000a\u000aKarl Schubach even made a acoustic version for his girlfriend. It's honestly one of the most beautiful songs, period. [This is it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aOMsoy2f2M)
p11026
aVAmazing song. Gives me chills every time
p11027
aV8:18 By TDWP http://youtu.be/5x5os7QtV2g
p11028
aVErra - Dreamcatcher  \u000aHaste The Day - Chorus Of Angels  \u000aRise Against - Swing Life Away  \u000aKamelot - The Haunting (Somewhere In Time)  \u000aParkway Drive - Wild Eyes  \u000aSabaton - Resist &amp; Bite  \u000aBMTH - Crucify Me  \u000aAlexisonfire - Rough Hands  \u000aSort of half metalcore but those are a couple I think are beautiful. Mostly because of vocals and lyrics but musically I think they all have a pretty beautiful sound? This is a weird question for me, I think beauty's subjective.
p11029
aVAlexisonfire, those cleans.. Honourable mention to \u000a\u000a[Alexisonfire - Get Fighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIUbUAYwkTs)\u000a\u000a[Alexisonfire - Happiness By The Kilowatt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpsBkvVxrbQ)\u000a\u000aStill bummed that last album never came out, ep got us all hyped...

p11032
aVSeconding The Price of Everything
p11033
aVReveries of Flight - Oh, Sleeper
p11034
aVIf it HAS to be metalcore, then maybe Protest the Hero - Mist, or Periphery - Mile Zero\u000a\u000aIf not, then\u000aCounterparts - Decay\u000a\u000aAmerican Football - The Summer Ends (or really anything off of American Football s/t)\u000a\u000aBrand New - Handcuffs\u000a\u000aPity Sex - Hollow Body
p11035
aVDecay is so relaxing. Also, Brand New are my favourite band. I like your taste.
p11036
aVThanks man!
p11037
aVMist is so good. That outro is beautiful.
p11038
aVPeriphery had a few on the new album(s), namely A Black Minute, Omega, and Stranger Things.\u000a\u000a\u000aThey all send shivers down my spine.
p11039
aVAugust Burns Red, "Creative Captivity" 
p11040
aV[Spirit Breaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkLttNn7dhU) by August Burns Red really gets me.\u000a\u000aI also really love concept albums. \u000a[Shogun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqAfDMix7D8) by Trivium is the most beautiful album of all time in my opinion.\u000aAlso amazing is [No Secret Revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss8zwatUpqE) by Affiance. The last song, Calculate and Control, is particularly awesome.
p11041
aV[ERRA - Dementia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ9Ae6x_XA8)
p11042
aVI second the movement for [Beauty in Tragedy by August Burns Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-noYJ459dE). It has to be one of the best songs I have ever seen live.
p11043
aVI saw August Burns Red live about 2 weeks ago, and I have never been to a better performance. The first three bands were pretty good, but ABR blew me away. I can't wait for the next time they come in concert. 
p11044
aVThat was my experience too. When I saw them they were with Beartooth, Defeater, and Blessthefall. Defeater were the best of the openers and really put in the work and the rest of the openers were ok. As soon as ABR took the stage the whole venue transformed. The whole crowd energy was different. The show was phenomenal. They're onee of those bands that's even better live.
p11045
aVUnbeliever by Architects
p11046
aVCame here to post this!
p11047
aVThe Tracks We Leave Behind - Dream On, Dreamer. Absolutely love it and it has so much meaning to me.\u000a\u000aEdit: Also Beauty in Tragedy -  ABR :3
p11048
aVNot really metalcore, but Dreamhouse by Deafheaven is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard, considering it's got elements of death metal. 
p11049
aVSpirit Breaker - August Burns Red
p11050
aVWCAR's "A War Inside" is an absolutely beautiful song, especially after the midpoint of the song. I'd link it if I were on my laptop but sadly I can't :/ I know I'll probably get downvoted for this one, but Pierce The Veil's "I'm Low On Gas" is pretty great too, despite how clich most 'core fans make them out to be..
p11051
aVI think the breakdown in Present, Future and Past is so fucking powerful. I always crank it up when that breakdown hits because it gives me chills and I just fucking love it. 
p11052
aVThe Way That We Have Been, Never Let me Go, and I Survive are all good too. 
p11053
aVWe came as Romans choruses are the definition of beautiful in my opinion

p11055

p11059
aV"40 days..." And "Open Water" by blessthefall
p11060
aVI know they're not really metalcore but I think [Hello - Evanescence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPam_3D9eXU) is really beautiful. 
p11061
aVDelusion by Novelists, Periastra (Prima Terra) by Canis Major, or Up All Night by Volumes. The last choice is slightly cheesier for me than the first two, but nevertheless I think all the songs have some nice riffs, emotion in the vocals and just an overall amazing feeling to them. 
p11062
aVDiscoveries by Northlane. an absolutely beautiful instrumental track
p11063
aV"Understanding What We've Grown to Be" by WCAR, "Rebirth" by Erra, and "I, the Jury" by The Color Morale.

p11083
aVCocaine or heroin? I know for sure he did cocaine, but idk where I got the other from.

(lp11130
VGet a metronome, start practicing your riffs at a low BPM and work your way up to the speed that you want. Just keep practicing it and you'll get it. 
p11131
aVThis is essentially it. Also, try to break the riff down as a physical exercise while practicing it slowly. Concentrate on what your fingers feel like when you play it correctly. Sometimes, there is a little bit of physical strain - learn to enjoy this. 
p11132
aVHaha I've never heard or thought about that before. Thanks!
p11133

p11144
aVwhich rule is he breaking? im pretty sure the rule is it's ok to self promote as long as you contribute to the sub, which he does.
p11145
aV- reddit is a community, not a platform for self-promotion\u000a\u000a- You should not just start submitting your links - it will be unwelcome and may be removed as spam, or your account will be banned as spam.\u000a\u000a- if your stuff is good enough, people will vote for it naturally (this exact post was also submitted yesterday)\u000a\u000ahttp://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion - here's the wiki if you'd like to read more about self-promotion on reddit!\u000a\u000a\u000a
p11146
aVi see your point but he's not just spamming links constantly, he comments on other subs and contributes here pretty often. just because he's posting his stuff doesn't automatically make him a shill.
p11147
aVThats why Im glad we are a sub which accepts and looks into Check out my Band posts etc. If not used excessively the self promotion is no problem
p11148
aVan admin wouldn't do anything because he contributes. the unspoken rule is 90/10. contribute 90, self-promote 10%. including comments. if you look at his user page, it's the only thing on the first page, which clearly indicates he is an active redditor.

aVProbably Crown the Empire
p11158
aVAsking Alexandria/Down &amp; Dirty for sure.
p11159
aVCan agree with the first album from AA, their second sounded like they got drunk and wrote some songs about a party. Never got into their 3rd.
p11160
aV1st is also my favourite, 2nd they literally did get drunk/high before writing it (album is more or less about that) liked the 3rd but nothing stuck with me as hard as the first. I love all songs that danny features in though. Like endless sky by I See Stars, he drops the most egotistical line ever but it gives me chills.\u000a\u000aAlso I was a fan of his screams in Breathe Carolina - Sellouts.
p11161
aVWell I mean Breathe Carolina's entire new album was really good IMO
p11162
aVI admit I played it a lot. I have a man-crush on Tyler Carter so I loved that collab. They have like 3 subgenres within that album so I can play the whole thing without feeling sick of a particular sound. I like the idea that they have their core sound but then they get stars from other distinct sounds and make each song a unique piece :)
p11163
aVFavorite song is easily Mistakes.\u000a
p11164
aVAm going to jam it now! 
p11165
aVFor All Those Sleeping has some pretty heavy breakdowns in some songs. Other than them, I'd say I See Stars because I also like electronic music a bit and they combine the two perfectly.

p11186
aVblessthefall and old Escape The Fate. Saw BTF with Craig 3 times including the black on black tour. Have seen them with Beau 4 times they are probably one of the best live bands. Old etf with ronnie is probably one of my favorite posthardcore/genricore band. \u000a\u000a\u000aI can never not put these 2 together since they both got me into heavy Music. 
p11187
aVSeeing Escape the Fate and Falling in Reverse together next month :D My nostalgia meter is off the charts :)

aVSaw them here in Chicago last year for the Bury The Hatchet tour. They were fucking phenomenal live! Enjoy!

p11191
aVOMG I hope they do that again for situations :D Wow i'm very jealous that sounds so good. I'm going to Westfest in NZ and they have:\u000a\u000aJudas Priest, Soundgarden, Faith No More, Lamb of God, Fall Out Boy, All Time Low, Antemasque, Papa Roach, The Devil Wears Prada, Fear Factory, Escape The Fate, Falling In Reverse, Mayhem, Lagwagon, Animals As Leaders, Frenzal Rhomb, The Wonder Years, Crown The Empire, 8 Foot Sativa, Kitsch, Killing Yourself For Profit, Depths.\u000a\u000aIt's 2pm-11pm so I doubt any of the bands will have long sets aye. But fingers crossed!\u000a

p11193
aVCan anybody explain what genericore is?
p11194
aVAnswered down below, but it's a term for mocking the more generic sounding metalcore bands like Asking Alexandria etc.
p11195
aVAh ok i looked it up and was a bit confused because one of the examples used was "ring Me the Horizon's vocalist Oliver Sykes plays in a genericore band. " and i dont think bmth are generic at all

aVI don't know if I would consider TAIB generic. They're pretty technical at times 
p11201
aVGeneric and technical aren't mutually exclusive, Blessthefall is another pretty generic band, but they have some pretty technical parts as well
p11202
aVTrue, I see what your saying. When I hear generic I automatically think of chug-chug breakdown bands 
p11203
aVThey can be a bit technical but as you said only at times. I love "Great Faith I Fools" probably one of the most played metalcore albums in my library, but the vocals are layered and over produced, they have tons of breakdowns per song, especially when following the generic breakdown code by playing a breakdown then playing it again in half time, and they also have catchy choruses in most of their songs.

aVThe still have an image. Just because they don't dress like Motionless or BVB doesn't mean they don't have a look. If they would dress in a different way it'll make you as a consumer look at they differently. Every band has a image or look. They have to for marketing purposes.

p11282
aVThanks! The highs are still really new to me, and even then I'm really not used to doing them this high. Thanks for checking it out and leaving a comment man, that's really appreciated!
p11283
aVI really dig your highs, IMO you should keep them that way. They're very original sounding and sound hard to pull off. You definitely sound as if you haven't perfected them yet, and upon reading that they're still really new for you I'm still honestly shocked. Keep the overall sound to your highs, don't try to emulate other vocalists too much. They're a great basis to start off of though.\u000a\u000aI remember covering this on Rock Band back in high school back when I was able to scream. Never got around to recording it once I got a real set-up, [but I'm damn proud of the fast part I did on this OIC cover.](http://youtu.be/wQUTQsEd5hQ?t=1m13s)
p11284
aVDamn! That was a really amazing cover man! Your screams are killer! I really dig the tone they have. I'd like to add more grit to mine but I'm still figuring all of it out.  \u000a\u000aI'm a growler first and foremost. I've been doing the growls for a little over 2 years but I've only gotten into the screaming a couple of months ago, but I guess the growls at least gave me a head start there haha.  \u000a \u000aThanks for checking the cover out and leaving a reply man! Really appreciated :). 
p11285
aVWhat's your set-up?
p11286
aVI have AKG Perception 220 condensor microphone and a SM58 dynamic microphone. The AKG is my go-to microphone when I record from my 'home studio', but I'll sometimes take out the SM58 (that I mainly use for live purposes) if I feel I need it. I love the AKG for cleans especially but for the more intense vocals like growls and screams I like to take out the SM58 to have more freedom in terms on moving around. I also have a sort of portable vocal booth for the AKG that [looks like this](https://www.musicmatter.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x800/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/p/o/portablevocalboothv22.jpg) and I record in an untreated room  \u000a  \u000aThe microphones run into a Focusright Scarlett 2i2 USB interface, nothing fancy here really.  \u000a\u000aI mix all the vocals in Reaper. I don't have too much going on, a bit of EQ to roll off a little on the lower end. Some compression to deal with the volumes and a little reverb and delay here and there. I sometimes use a bit of saturation if I feel the vocals need it, but that rarely happens.  \u000a \u000aHope that gave you a bit of insight! Feel free to ask if there's anything I can help with! I'm happy to help where I can :). 
p11287
aVI've been out of the screaming game for a while now. Your cover brings me back to the good days though. Subbed you on YouTube, looking forward to more. \u000a\u000aYou listen to Greeley estates? I feel like your highs would be dope on a song like straitjacket.

aVThanks man! That's a huge compliment! I find it very hard to listen to my own vocals objectively, so I get a real kick when others seem to enjoy them :). Thanks for checking out the cover and leaving a comment!
p11290
aVNot a problem, looking forward to more! 
p11291
aVNice! I liked it. I have a question, how do you get the instrumentals of the song and then put your voice over it?
p11292
aVPopular bands such as AA have most songs on instrumental format somewhere on YouTube. Usually someone covers all the instruments and lets people freely use them for vocal covers.
p11293
aVThere is no instrumental for "Morte Et Dabo" this cover is just the regular "vocals on top of the original track".
p11294
aVTrue! With some slight modifications here and there on the original track. 
p11295
aVWhile this is true, I didn't use an instrumental for the cover. I explained it a bit more in depth in the comment above but what I do is lower the frequencies where the vocals 'cut-through' in the mix of the original. Then I replace those vocals with my own so that those will be the only ones you'll hear.
p11296
aVI'll try to give a brief explanation of what I do, but I tend to ramble a bit when it comes to these subjects, so bear with me.  \u000a\u000aWhat I do is I lower the frequences where the vocals 'cut-through' in the mix in the original. Basically, vocals cut through the rest of the mix at around 1,5-2KHz. So what I do is I put an equaliser on the original track and lower the 1,5-2KHz frequency range by about 4-5dB.  \u000a \u000aThen I give my own vocals a bit of a boost at the 1,5KHz range to make sure that my vocals are the only ones you'll hear. The original vocals aren't all gone but you won't be able to hear them.  \u000a\u000aI used to create my own 'instrumentals' by cutting out the vocals entirely by using a center extractor but I feel that takes away too much of the other instruments.  \u000a\u000aI'm glad you enjoyed it, thanks for checking it out! I hope I managed to help you out a bit :).

aVThanks! Helps a lot.

VI've imagined this literally every day of my life to hundreds of different songs, but I think doing Escape by The Devil Wears Prada would be the bee's knees.\u000a\u000aThe problem is--which this is the reason I don't have a video--is that metalcore/post-hardcore covers tend to be executed VERY poorly, especially by kids in high school.

aVThat would have been awesome if the singer wasn't so awful. Hard to sound like Kurt Travis, but he was brutal. Actually got better towards the end, but still.

p11366
aVGo listen to their first EP and forget everything you know about them. That is literally the greatest music you will ever hear.
p11367
aV[Here's](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/memphis-may-fire/2015/danforth-music-hall-toronto-on-canada-7bca6e90.html) their current setlist. Surprisingly, there are only 3 songs from their (awful) new album. But I'd suggest listening to those if you want to know what to expect. They aren't playing anything from the Sleepwalking album, which is IMO their best one. If you wanna listen to their best work just start with that one. Personally I think Challenger is their 2nd best album, and they still play a lot of songs from that live. I could not really get into The Sinner, but many people here view it as their best album. They play the title track off that though, which is a pretty good song.
p11368
aVNo Ordinary Love sucks a thousand dicks, but other than that that's a surprisingly decent setlist. At this point they have to realize that their fans don't want to hear the shitty new album so it's nice seeing them play relatively old songs. Also btw the album is called The Hollow, not The Sinner.
p11369
aVOops. Oh well, in my head it's just the "The" album.
p11370
aVTotally agree with Sleepwalking being their best album all time. 3  out of 9 songs is awful enough.. they should just replace them with songs out of Sleepwalking.
p11371
aVNot really that into them, but I'd say their best song is Vices
p11372
aVChallenger forever my favorite album. Alive in the Lights hits me hard.

aVI saw him at the show in Detroit doing the same sort of thing. I didn't talk to him but he was hanging at the side bar catching a few drinks chatting up a few people as well. I didn't approach him because I didn't want to be rude and interrupt but I got that same sort of vibe from him. Seems like such a cool guy and definitely doesn't have a huge ego like some of the guys in the scene do.

aVI was at the edmonton show as well. Not a big MMI fan, but they put on a hell of a show. \u000a\u000aDuring the ABR set, I was right near the front row headbanging away. I randomly looked to my left and I saw Levi right next to me jamming out with the rest of the crowd. I saw Jesse Cash too and he offered to lift me up to go crowd surfing. It's so awesome to see the supporting bands in the crowd, socializing with everyone else after their set is over.
p11397
aVHe was to the left if stage by all the instruments for like half the show, he really loves his job man.\u000a\u000aAnd shit , fit for a king ROCKED IT !!

p11400
aVyep, levi's fucking awesome. I saw them 3 summers back at Warped Tour, and was crowdsurfing during their final song (i think it was Masses of a Dying Breed? not positive). As i got towards the front, i started falling, with just my legs on top of people and my torso pretty much hanging. After like 20 seconds, people started helping me back up, and i realized to my left was the stage, and to my right was Levi who apparently jumped into the crowd while i was falling. The song was almost over, but he had one last section to do vox for, so he yelled "hey, stay right there!" and rolled overtop of me to get back to the stage. As i made it to the front, we high-fived. \u000a\u000aLater in the day, I stopped by their merch booth to say hi, and he and I had a good laugh at it. 
p11401
aVI am so fucking choked this tour didn't come to Vancouver. They hit plenty of other western Canada cities (Calgary, Edmonton), but I guess scheduling just didn't work out. I love MMI, ABR and Erra immensely and being able to see them on the same bill would have been awesome (I would have driven to Seattle but, alas, other obligations). :(
p11402
aVCan confirm he is awesome. Years ago after they released their first album (not their EP) I saw him outside the venue unloading and asked him why they changed their song name from "No Need to Whip a Dead Horse" and he told me their recording studio or whatever didn't like it. Chatted with him for a minute as the line was moving, but it was a great impression and they kicked ass at the show.

p11434
aVThey sure do, could I ask where you are from?  I think its spelt wrong but doesn't matter haha. Glad to see you know of them, I just thought most people on this sub wouldn't know the bands or the label. (may know birds in row because of deathwish inc, another great band). Enjoy the show!
p11435
aVI'm from the UK, suprised Plebian are even playing here. Checked my ipod, it's Vuyvr. I stumbled across the label a few years ago looking for a copy of Birds In Rows collections I think, unfortunately I don't think it's many people tastes on this sub. Shame cause it doesn't get enough love. 
p11436
aVI only discovered it a week ago but I'm so glad I did. I was starting to see more Converge love so I thought people may dig it here .
p11437
aVI only knew Birds In Row, but I just downloaded every album from that list with a genre description that interested me.  Got a GB or so of music to check out.  Very excited to check it out.\u000a\u000aI'd just like to point out that for a smaller indie record label, putting up a bunch of free downloads like this is a great move.  They may not have gotten any of my money (yet) but now I have heard of a bunch of their bands I otherwise never would of known about, and very likely may end up spending money on other releases.  
p11438
aVCheck out the band page for descriptions on the label's site as it  probably  a bit more accurate. But I'm really glad you ate checking it out, I hope you dig it.\u000a\u000aI agree its a great idea, as I'm not the biggest on pirating so I nay have remembered one band and spotified them for a month then maybe buy the album, but now I shared it to you, we all found new artists on the label and I'm probably going to buy a decent sized purchase sometime this year.

aVOh, definitely, especially Ahren's. Thanks mate.

aVhttps://soundcloud.com/mandozombie23/chasing-ghosts-practice/s-xKc3r\u000a\u000aHere's my clip. You seem FAR more experienced than myself, so any pointers beyond the stuff I talk about in the description would be extremely appreciated.
p11461
aVI'm not actually all that experienced. I'm just basing it off of what I've seen/heard. Joel live sounds like high false chord screams, like what youre doing, but on the album it sounds more like low fry screams. When I scream along I do the low fries. But my advice for you is, mainly, just use your diaphragm more. I know you've probably heard that a billion times from everyone ever. But just practice pushing more and getting better volume. I feel like with better volume you'll notice your screams sounding better. I scream in the car about every other day, and that seems to work out well for me, so I suggest you do that too. Youre free to be as loud as you need to be. I don't do it every day so I give my vocal chords a chance to rest. But I will sing on the off days, to stay in practice, and also cuz it's fucking fun. \u000aAlso drink water. Like drink two glasses when you get up in the morning. Drink two with meals. Drink one or a bottle when you scream. It's more important than youd think.

aVI think it comes down to how much do your friends perform, I have a lot of friends in bands too and some do 3 to 4 shows a month and understand I can't be there for all of them and if there's a good a good show in town I'd rather go to that one. Meanwhile I have one friends band who is starting out and can only get 1 show per month so I try to go to their's to support them.
p11479
aVI'd definitely say go to the Frozen Flame tour, great lineup of bands that you shouldn't miss, as much fun as local shows can be
p11480
aVFrozen Flame Tour, I feel like they would agree with your decision haha. Also, Starland love \u2764\ufe0f

p11484

VYou Can't Spell Slaughter Without Laughter by I Set My Friends on Fire
p11486
aVLooking back, I felt pretty embarrassed that I used to like this album...but after spinning it again, surprisingly there are a couple good songs on it..
p11487
aVI love all the tracks on that album. When I first started to listen to heavier music they were my gateway. I think I listened to that album 5 times in one day. I even enjoy HxC 2-Step
p11488
aVHxC 2-Step is the only "proper" (proper as in fits the definition) crunkcore I've ever heard. And it's actually pretty neat. 
p11489
aVI've actually never listened to them, but they seemed to make a huge impact when they broke up. Any good places to start? 
p11490
aVI would say just jump right in to You Can't Spell Slaughter Without Laughter. Its their first and best record\u000a\u000aThings that Rhyme with Orange if you like more poppy integrated stuff and actually Reese Pieces I Don't Know Who John Cleese Is is a pretty structurally sound song as well\u000a\u000a
p11491
aVTo add to that, 'Life Hertz' is actually a pretty nice song, and 'It comes naturally' is catchy as fuck, both of which are on their second album. 
p11492
aV[Their Soulja Boy cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BjmSkxM5fQ).
p11493
aVSome girl in my pre-calc class had this as her ringtone and it went off in class.  You could feel the cringe from everyone.
p11494
aVFun fact, although the two main members did split, Matt continues to make music for ISMFOF. They actually have an album on the way. 
p11495
aV**Woe, Is Me - Genesi[s]**\u000a\u000aI liked it for the chugfest that it was. Not anything special, but gets me pumped as shit, what with the breakdowns every 2 seconds and whatnot. \u000a\u000a**Abandon All Ships - Geeving**\u000a\u000aThe fallen heroes of crabcore's only listenable album IMO.
p11496
aVI enjoyed infamous, but then again theres something about them and other mediocre electronicore bands that hold a special place in my heart. shame they broke up, though. 
p11497
aVSeconded on Woe, Is Me.  Genesi[s] is such a hype album.  So much energy, regardless of how good or bad most of the songs actually are.
p11498
aVYeah, it's definitely a good album to get the blood flowing. [This one might be my favorite on the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgcDYOHBojQ) (and also has a killer BLEGH). 
p11499
aVI think [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEj5iq9Ko98#t=146) is my favorite breakdown on the album, but I Came, I Saw, I Conquered is also pretty badass too.
p11500
aVI can't ever get over the golden line "must be hard to talk shit with a dick in your throat"\u000a\u000aI chuckle every time

aVWhat song is this referencing? 
p11506
aVDemons with ryu
p11507
aVI'm not ashamed to say I like Goodbye To The Gallows and Speaker Of The Dead. I'm a little ashamed to say I don't mind Eternal Enemies.... I know it's so bad but I can't help but listen to it. 
p11508
aVGotta love Emmure
p11509
aVEternal Enemies was the only album I had on my phone for a while because of an accident with my torrents. I now listen to it all the time. 
p11510
aVi love emmure. their music is fun and their shows are always great. (seriously, if they have a show near you: go. you will have a good time) they always are true to themselves and try to do their own thing. i respect that. 
p11511
aVAnd they can put out a decent song if they need to that's not chug chug http://youtu.be/tDaqml5SPoU
p11512
aVattack attack
p11513
aVTheir first two albums were golden, and then it turned into god knows what. Glad we got Beartooth out of it tho. 
p11514
aVI really liked that last album. 
p11515
aVThat first album is awesome. I still spin it on occasion.
p11516
aVCaraphernelia by Pierce the Veil... Dat Chorus ist just so catchy 
p11517
aVFuck it man, Pierce the Veil is awesome. Collide With the Sky is my shit.
p11518
aVThe atmosphere of those songs, most notably I'm Low On Gas And You Need A Jacket, is something that I enjoy to the point of frustration. But King for a Day is auditory cancer in my opinion.
p11519
aVJeremy Mckinnon slays in this, and its just as good, if not better live. 
p11520
aVThe first time I heard it was at a concert... At the point where everybody started clapping above their heads to the chorus I knew that I wouldn't get that song out of my head the rest of the night! 
p11521
aVI was fortunate enough to get to see them with ADTR on the house party tour, and shit just got so rowdy when Jeremy came out. 
p11522
aVyou shouldn't feel guilty listening to pierce the veil

aVDAE?!?
p11526
aVThat new Of Mice And Men song.
p11527
aVBroken Generation is a pretty good song if you view it as Nu-Metal instead of metalcore. 
p11528
aVLink? Its not on youtube from my ps3.
p11529
aVIt was posted earlier here on /r/Metalcore. Just go back on the front page, you'll see it. 
p11530
aVThanks!
p11531
aVNo prob. I was about to link it for you lol. 
p11532
aVYeah, I didn't realize it was posted 8 hours ago so it went to the bottom of the page.  Regardless it was a waste to listen to of course.
p11533
aVSeriously. I liked Restoring Force but not as much as their earlier releases, but shit, Broken Generation restored (heh) my faith in the band.
p11534
aVAriana Grande. Too guilty of a pleasure?
p11535
aVAbsolutely not, she has a nice voice. Just a little too poppy for my taste
p11536
aVnope, she's talented
p11537
aVI mean I don't really feel ''guilty'' when I listen to it, but I like a lot of generic stuff, and I understand why it's bad and generic, but sometimes I like stupid chugging, breakdowns galore, and cookie cutter vocals.  Ex:  Asking Alexandria, Capture the Crown, Crown the Empire, Of Mice &amp; Men, basically just risecore\u000a\u000aEDIT: remembered something that really makes me feel guilty for liking, Black Veil Bride's first album, hate all their other stuff but I really dig their first one
p11538
aVI like In The End by Black Veil Brides, the only song I like by them, it just gives me chills when I listen to it..
p11539
aVI'm not even guilty that 3OH!3 and Hollywood Undead make up a huge portion of my daily listening. Catchy songs and HU has some really hard hitting lyrics, especially in Swan Songs. 
p11540
aVYou're my new best friend

aVMake me your reddit friend so I know it's real. 
p11542
aVPanic! At the Disco - A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. I don't know what the fuck it is, but it's just so damn catchy. I hate the rest of their stuff and that genre in general, but there is just something about that one...

aVShould feel no guilt for that, it's a classic.

aVPop punk. I love that album as well. And all of P!ATD

aVAll depends on the listener. I'd classify it as pop punk.

aVThe Artist by Alesana\u000a\u000aSome legit songs on that album. 
p11561
aVLove me some Alesana. A place where the sun is silent is one of my favorite albums
p11562
aVI've started up a sleeve circling the story
p11563
aVI never would consider this a guilty pleasure. The Emptiness is a piece of art and is one of the best composed albums I have heard. 
p11564
aVI enjoy listening to songs from the "Punk Goes X" line of work. It's how I learn the pop songs of our day.

aVI don't consider anything a guilty pleasure because I consider all of what I listen to good music.

aVBrokencyde.\u000a\u000aI know it's absolutely terrible but I find it so funny I can't stop.
p11568
aVIs Brokencyde trying to be serious or not? I've always thought of them as a satire/parody band.\u000a\u000a*"Let's get freaky now, let's get fucking freaky now"* had me in tears the first time I heard it, lmao. 
p11569
aVIf they are satire I love them. If not then fuck my life i'm done.
p11570
aVRecently its been Pierce the Veil, specifically their older album "Selfish Machines"
p11571
aVMindless Self Indulgence, You'll Rebel to Anything (As long as it's not challenging)
p11572
aVAny electronicore really with those really catchy, synthy interludes such as Attack Attack!, I See Stars, That's Outrageous!, etc. Oh and The 1975. 
p11573
aVwhat's wrong with The 1975?
p11574
aVAnything Taylor Swift is involved in. So good. 
p11575
aVKpop. I'm an Asian living in Asia so it's not really a guilty pleasure, but it will be as soon as I move to the West. 
p11576
aVI'm gonna be THAT guy... Black Veil Brides, there's just something about their guitar work that I LOVE. It's probably just because they're not a metalcore chugfest or some shit 
p11577
aVI don't really have any guilty pleasures. I'm pretty open about what I listen to. \u000a\u000aHaving said that if I had to pick something it would probably be Restoring Force, I love that album.
p11578
aVI don't have any guilty pleasures because I'm comfortable with everything I listen to.

aVHoly hell I'm an idiot. Carry on.
p11589
aVI like the song Heaven's Calling by Black Veil Brides. \u000a\u000aIf it doesn't have to be -core related. I really like Ke$ha's first album. And don't mind most pop music in general. 
p11590
aVMy thing about most pop music is that it's great background music for large gatherings of people, but not a lot of it has caught my attention enough to look into the artists themselves. 
p11591
aVThat's somewhat the way it is for me. I can't sit down and listen a whole pop cd often. But it's enjoyable as a song here and a song there. \u000a\u000a&gt;but not a lot of it has caught my attention enough to look into the artists themselves.\u000a\u000aI just listened to her for the first time today, but give Charli XCX a shot. [My Own Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Va-6_60-gg) and [Breaking Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fkt91iye4c) (song starts at 40 seconds in.)
p11592
aVCurrently in class, but i will update once i get home from work! (Shes fine as hell though holy fuck)
p11593
aVHope you enjoy it. It's got a really "retro" 80's-ish sound to it. 
p11594
aVShe's great, something I would sing under my breath all day
p11595
aVI love lots of Christina Perri's songs, especially "Sea of Lovers, Human, Jar of Hearts".\u000a\u000aThere's really many pop songs I genuinely enjoy.\u000a\u000aEdit: Woops, this wasn't supposed to be an answer, whatever.

p11611
aVthey are...
p11612
aVGenesi[s] is my biggest guilty pleasure, but I don't ever want to mention it, otherwise everyone grabs their pitchforks.
p11613
aVHow do you like it compared to Number[s]?\u000a\u000aDeciding whether to give it a good listen or not and I liked the older one. Is it very different without Tyler and Michael?
p11614
aVIt's definitely not as good as Number[s], but I'd give it a shot. Yeah, it's different without Tyler and Michael. I'm quite a fan of Tyler's replacement, Hance. Michael's replacement (Doriano I think his name is) isn't as good, though. I feel like it could have been anyone and it wouldn't have made a difference. 
p11615
aVSweet I will give it a jam tonight. I keep hearing good things about Hance so I must check him out. I've been told that Number[s] is highlights Bohn, meanwhile Issues highlights Carter more. Is this fair to say?
p11616
aVVery fair to say. I think that Michael is criminally underused in Issues' Self-titled. If you'd like a delicious WIM middle-ground, there's always [Vengeance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXOaYKfnQSk), which has Hance and Michael. 
p11617
aVI just gave this a listen (for the first time) very very nice, Bohn delivers as always. Hance surprised me. Is he doing anything these days?
p11618
aVHe has a new band, [Favorite Weapon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYbstZ1V8zs), which is quite a large diversion from Woe. More Post-Hardcore than anything else. 
p11619
aVI'm jamming the song Hollow right now (decided not to be lazy and actually search for it) A bit soft for my liking and not as rnb'y as a like my cleans but not band for it's genre.
p11620
aVYeah, it's not really my style either, but the dude's still an exceptional vocalist.
p11621
aVPersonally, I loved it. One of my favorite albums.
p11622
aVI love Number[s] a lot but I still enjoy Genesi[s]. I enjoy Number[s] more in part because I like Michael Bohn better than Doriano and I enjoy the speed in Number[s] a lot but when it comes to being genuinley angry and catchy Genesi[s] does a really good job. Also I like Hance Alligood more than Tyler Carter so there's that too. 
p11623
aVThanks for the reply! I'm a mega Tyler fanboy so I'm now intrigued to see what Hance sounds like :D\u000a\u000aedit: any suggestions on the album to start with?
p11624
aVNo problem! I like Tyler a lot too which is why I'm also in love with Issues but after I heard Hance on Vengence and then his stuff with Oh, Manhattan (realy good btw he puts out so much emotion in his cleans and screams) I was hooked. Hmm hard question, personally I'm an advocate of just going beginning to end but specifically I Told You Once is great and heavy, Nothing Left To Lose and the acoustic version are good, The Walking Dead, and A Story To Tell are all good fun songs.
p11625
aVI'll smash out the whole album after work (10:40am here on a Monday...) Cheers man!
p11626
aVTell me what you think!
p11627
aVAgreed.  I've Told You Once, The Walking Dead, and FYI are great blood pumping songs, but i never tell anyone I have it on my phone because of the general consensus of the album .
p11628
aVI suppose it's just from what I've seen. It would appear I may have spoke too soon. Maybe in a perfect world/subreddit it would be different!
p11629
aVFor the most part, this community is fine with this sort of thing. There are just a few bands that should come with a trigger warning. 
p11630
aV&gt; There are just a few bands that should come with a trigger warning. \u000a\u000aLOL, this would actually be funny.
p11631
aVMaybe the mods should enforce their seventh rule more?\u000a\u000a-Don't be a dick-

p11633

p11638
aVbesides the circlejerks, this is a decent community
p11639
aVHonestly the worst part about this sub, it drives me fucking crazy. But I've learned to keep my mouth shut about it.
p11640
aVThis is about the only place online I've found where the users don't instantly brand you a 14 year old for liking this sort of music. So kudos to y'all for that. 
p11641
aVthat's funny because everyone in this sub is a prick about Sworn In 
p11642
aVHey, I love sworn in.

p11644

aVUsername is applicable. 
p11646
aVthey have crazy potential. the death card is incredible as a whole and the EP is great. 
p11647
aVagreed man
p11648
aVSee I dislike this sub because everyone is self absorbed in what they listen to. There is almost no discussion here. When you look this sub compared to hiphopheads it looks like a joke.
p11649
aVHiphopheads has plenty of its own issues.
p11650
aVI wouldn't go as far as to say *everyone* is. I'm sure there are people within the community that may be. But I'd say the numbers of people that aren't that way may far outweigh the numbers of people that are.
p11651
aVI do agree.  For the most part, this sub is a pretty good community. 
p11652
aVWithout a doubt the best place to go to discuss this sort of music. Active mods, decent posts, and inside jokes makes this a good sub. 
p11653
aVThat's another thing I should have mentioned and I will above. The mods seem to be on top of it. Coincidentally enough since you mentioned that a mod has already taken part in this thread as well!
p11654
aVYeah man.  Ton of good vibes here.  It's not the most thriving sub-reddit I've ever been to but it's extremely welcoming and I've discovered so much good music here and read some awesome stories.
p11655
aVGlad you're enjoying it so far. I'm certainly glad I stumbled upon the subreddit
p11656
aVI wish /r/metal was even half as welcoming as this sub.
p11657
aVIt's not too bad if you make it out that you like the kvlt bands or mastodon haha
p11658
aVYeah haha I just feel like if you say the wrong thing over there you're fucked.\u000a\u000a"Oh that reminds me of a Monuments part"\u000a\u000a"FUCK OFF POSER"
p11659
aVOh shit, they won't forget that. I do personally to a bit of metal and the metalcore i listen to is relatively respected so I don't get in much trouble when i mention myself, I even defend metalcore haha
p11660
aVI wish I had a similar experience. This is a genre I assumed would have created a close-nit community with the general themes of these bands, but I find more of a divide between people getting hung up on genres and categorizing bands into neat little boxes. Calling this artist "post-punk-rock-hardcore-numetal" and others saying they're "post-punk-popcore-metal". I get the most now out of being a lurker to see what's new and what people are saying about the new music.\u000a\u000aNever imagined I'd see Periphery as the banner of this subreddit, so props for that.
p11661
aVI've noticed some of that, some of it yesterday in other threads at least. But I would say it still is a close-nit community, some of the users here know each other by their username/flair, and when it changes people know.
p11662
aVWhile there's an overabundance of both annoying ABR jerking and annoying anti-ABR jerking, for the most part I like this sub quite a bit\u000a\u000a(I know I used to contribute a lot to the annoying ABR jerking, so I apologize, I've been trying to cut back on that, they're just one of my favorite bands, so I have a tendency to mention them whenever I feel they're somewhat relevant)
p11663
aVHonestly though, ABR deserves it. They're one of the best bands in the genre, hands down. Just saw em again a couple weeks ago and was once again blown away that their live shows are so good, they make their albums almost seem like bootleg ripoffs
p11664
aVI don't see how it's "jerking" as long as it's relevant
p11665
aVIt's not, I just used to mention them all the time, even if it wasn't relevant, then I realized how annoying it was and stopped
p11666
aVAcceptance. Good work there 
p11667
aVAnd then you accepted for mistakes, felt bad about it, stopped using the old account, and assumed a new identity hoping no one would recognize you out of shame.
p11668
aVNot really, just wanted to change the name because it seemed a bit excessive 
p11669
aVI was kidding, I know why you changed your name.
p11670
aVAh, ok, hard to tell sometimes on the internet
p11671
aVWe've actually had this conversation before. Your new username is based off of a band you used to be in or something.
p11672
aVYeah, it's the name of one of my old bands
p11673
aVWere you on guitar or vocals?
p11674
aVVocals
p11675
aVBut you do play guitar right? I think I remember you mentioning it.
p11676
aVI play guitar a bit just for fun, vocals are my main thing though
p11677
aVI don't think I've ever seen an anti-ABR jerk. Unless the anti-ABR jerk is the whole effort to tone down the ABR jerk, then I see it
p11678
aVWell, I've just noticed a lot of hate on ABR simply because they're jerked a lot on this sub
p11679
aVThat they are. They are pretty great though :p
p11680
aVI agree haha, I've tried to tone down the jerking a bit though
p11681
aVUnderstandable, for as good as they are, there are other bands that deserve some discussion too :p
p11682

VThe thing is, that while I am sure that many of those screamers can sing as well, imagine them up on stage. They have to run around being the frontman, pump up the crowd, scream, and then switch directly over to singing. That takes a lot of energy, and that's how you get singers that sound like [Garrett Rapp](http://youtu.be/8qInQBCrKY8?t=33s).\u000a\u000aPersonally, I have nothing against clean vocals, but if you are gonna do both, you better make sure that you have the stamina to keep that up on stage. Of course Garrett Rapp is a very extreme example, and I know that there are guys out there who are beyond talented and can do both, but I have seen too many shows where half of the screams are pretty much just spoken, and half of the cleans are so horribly off key. 
p11686
aVOh... oh my. \u000a\u000aThat's a good point. I hadn't thought of that. 
p11687
aVYeah that all being said, if you can do both I have some serious respect for you. Sooooo practice makes perfect? Good luck man. 
p11688
aVholy balls i got respect for Mr. Rapp for at least sticking through the performance, goddamn
p11689
aVYeah it was like watching a train wreck, the poor guy. Respect. 
p11690
aVI wonder how much his lackluster performance here has to do with his in-ear monitors. I'm not excusing his performance here, it is irrevocably bad. But some of it could have to do with problems with the PA. In addition, the audio in this video doesn't sound properly mixed. It sounds like it was taken directly from the soundboard, which may contribute to the quality of his vocals heard here.
p11691
aVI think it has to do more with sharing the load of vocal duties than anything else. I mean, most guys who scream and growl eventually ruin their vocal chords over the years. Imagine adding singing on top of that? Forget about it. \u000a\u000aPlus, not everyone can be [Mike Patton](http://youtu.be/1qAzdEXawM8).
p11692
aVYou only ruin your vocal chords if you do it wrong
p11693
aVIt's incredibly easy to do it wrong. It's not just the technique, it's also emotion. A lot of vocalists get carried away during their set which makes excessive screaming that much more destructive, even if they apply the right technique usually. 
p11694
aVRight, but there are plenty of vocalists who have been screaming for over 10 years, and their voices sound fine, so technique still has a big effect on it
p11695
aVOh definitely. The screaming itself if done with the right technique ultimately won't destroy your voice, but there are many other factors included that might. But still you'll also have vocalists like Corey Taylor that scream their lungs out for almost two decades and still have a voice in their forties. 
p11696
aVThis exact rarity is why I have a lot of respect for individuals like Tommy Rogers and Matty Mullins. Matty might be a douchenozzle, but man he delivers live.\u000a\u000aDo you have any recorded samples of your vocal prowess?
p11697
aVI think Matty sings about 70% clean vocals in most songs ,but it sucks since I really like his screaming.
p11698
aVNot at the moment. I'm still really, really bad at screaming, haha. And my singing isn't anything special, either. I just think it's good enough for a band where singing isn't the main focus. 
p11699
aVSpeaking as somebody who started out in musicals and choirs then became interested in Metalcore some notes in clean singing require ALOT of breath especially if it's higher more tenor range (which most cleans are) so I think the screaming would just wipe out your breath then trying to deliver a clean all while trying to perform and put on a show. I don't think some of the best vocalists in the world could deliver on it.
p11700
aVBecause just because you can scream doesn't mean you can sing. Look at Alex from Atreyu. That fucker is one of the best screamers out there but him singing is like nails on a chalkboard. 
p11701
aVNot even really one of the best screamers anymore either, dude has no volume whatsoever. 
p11702
aVBecause it's really, really, really fucking hard to do both
p11703
aVI think some bands just don't want to have cleans. Look at August Burns Red, JB has mentioned many times in interviews that he doesn't think cleans would fit their style.
p11704
aVI think he's just talking about bands that have cleans, but have a different clean vocalist
p11705
aVYou're just figuring this out? I thought it was like a common thought that 90+% of unclean vocalists can't sing clean well. But it's also about the lung capacity aspect too.
p11706
aV82.4% of all statistics are made up on the spot. 90% is also a really big number, if you practice growls and screams with the right technique I feel it's ultimately beneficial for your abilities as a clean vocalist as well. At the end of the day your chords are still muscles that need exercise to become stronger, and you can exercise those muscles in multiple ways. 
p11707
aV100% of the numbers that i'm not citing along with a source were pulled out of my ass for dramatic effect. A lot of unclean vocalists just plain cannot sing well. I'm not saying it's like a blanket effect thing that EVERYONE who screams cannot sing, but it's fairly uncommon to find an unclean vocalist who can also do cleans very well.

aVYou doing yourself a disservice by not giving it a playthrough. The cleans are few and far in some of the songs, but performed so well. The screams are visceral and hit so many dynamic highs and lows. The drums are just absolutely gorgeous. And every guitar part plays in such brutal and harmonic melody. An instant hit. \u000a\u000aExpect to see OAA as this subreddit's next BotM.

p11745
(lp11746
VI'll be honest,  I've downloaded over 90% of it probably, although I feel bad I am in college and if I paid for everything I'd be beyond broke. But that being said, I do still believe in supporting the artist,  so I have bought a couple shirts from my favorite artists. \u000a\u000aEdit:should have just clarified in regards to the actual question. Download them all and listen off my phone/computer
p11747
aVI'm in the same boat. I try to go to shows and buy merch to support them as much as I can.
p11748
aVFor less than $10 a month you can have unlimited music through many platforms. You can't be *that* broke.\u000a\u000aEdit: If you're interesting in skipping lunch once a month to afford a music service, I use Google Music and I think it's awesome. You can download the music to your device and listen when off wifi so no mobile data is used. Also, I've yet to find an album not on the service... I used to be an avid downloader and this is a complete game-changer.
p11749
aVI do like this idea, as I've always wanted a "backup" of sorts for the possibility of the day when my phone dies and I lose all my tunes, but absolutely don't want to use "the cloud" or anything. I typically listen when walking places (no car), or doing things that keep me busy (some involving no access to internet).\u000a\u000aAnd while I do think I could afford it, I'm literally just pinching every penny I have until the summer where I have a job lined up. As is I'm only eating one meal a day, never eating out, and trying my best to stretch a couple hundred bucks for the next 4 months, while it is cheap, it is the result of paying for college myself and not being on student loans, which in itself, feels great!
p11750
aVI also switched to google music recently and completely fell in love with the service. If anyone is interested in trying it out [this link](http://g.co/GoogleFriends) will get you a 3 month trial instead of the usual 1.

p11756
aVTorrent it and listen to it locally on my phone.
p11757
aVDownload it, I use bandcamp when I can, or iTunes if what I want isn't on there. I use Spotify/Youtube to listen to something before I download it though and make sure I like it.
p11758
aVI love using Bandcamp when I can as well. Feels great knowing a bigger portion of the money is going directly to the artist. Also higher-quality downloads!
p11759
aVYeah! Bandcamp really is the only site where you can get FLACs as a download. Not like I'd need it - I usually download MP3 320 - but it's really neat.
p11760
aVMake purchases on vinyl. Buy the digital albums I actually really like and torrent/download the rest. Depends on how much money I have in my bank account.
p11761
aVCDs, youtube, Spotify. I weirdly listen to so much music through youtube, just old habits
p11762
aVThere's a web app called streamus that you can use to listen to music on YouTube while you browse the web. It's a lot better than just having a tab open because you can create playlists and save them and stuff. Highly recommend it.
p11763
aVStreamus thanks shall check it out when I go on the computer.
p11764
aVI mostly listen to stuff on Spotify, but I often just pirate music if I want to listen to it on my phone.
p11765
aVDownload leaks to listen to until it releases on Spotify. Don't hate.
p11766
aVI occasionally still go on YouTube video journeys just clicking suggested video after suggested video, found some great bands this way. I also used to just look up "top breakdown" videos and find songs based off great breakdowns did anyone else do this? Haha
p11767
aVThis is how I find new bands my self, (Most recently Struc/tures, fucking nutty) just plow through suggested videos. Then if I like them I'll buy an album, then repeat the process.\u000a\u000aI used to do the whole Top Breakdown videos too, but I just stopped for whatever reason. :p
p11768
aVHaha im not sure why I stopped either those breakdown videos can be awesome, I might have too check some out again now
p11769
aVI found Parkway Drive on one of those "Top 10 Post-Hardcore Bands" in like.. 2008 or 2009. Of course, I knew better than to call them Post-Hardcore. And fuck, Smoke Em If You Got Em is still one of my favorite Parkway songs.
p11770
aVThis is how I found them too!! Romance is dead was on like 75% of top breakdown videos back then haha
p11771
aVParkway is just all around amazing!
p11772
aVI purchase most of mine on CDs or vinyl.  Sometimes I use Spotify.
p11773
aVI still use the Zune Marketplace.  $10 a month for unlimited downloads. The only thing is you can only listen to music on your computer or a Zune.
p11774
aVI buy the cd and never use them and they just sit in a corner. Since I bought the cd I morally justify my piracy and then precede to download them all in FLAC and enjoy not having stupid proprietary restrictions :) And the cds are useful in the rare instance I use a car without an Aux lead or bluetooth or usb
p11775
aVItunes
p11776
aVI buy digital on itunes or amazon mp3. My vinyls are just wall decorations made of albums I really like.
p11777
aViTunes + vinyl
p11778
aVI always use iTunes. If I don't spend money on an album I never enjoy it as much because it has no value attached. When I spend money on it, I guess my brain feels like it must have some quality to it. 
p11779
aVNormally just listen to it on Spotify (I don't have premium unfortunately). If there's an album that I really want I'll usually get it on iTunes and sometimes (very rarely) I'll buy physical copies of albums if I really want to listen to them on car trips, the most recent being Juggernaut: Alpha and Juggernaut: Omega by Periphery.
p11780
aVI used to use itunes then I became broke paying for music.  So I started downloading on the pirate bay.  I switched from that to purchasing through amazon so I can have the physical album and auto rip.  I also use basic spotify when I don't want to pay for an album.  I purchased Periphery Juggernaut yesterday.
p11781
aVI buy my CDs through amazon usually as well, I love being able to download it in the future if I don't have my physical copy.\u000a\u000aAnd I didn't care for Juggernaut honestly, but I will be buying their self-titled album probably next week. :)
p11782
aVYeah I love the auto rip feature especially waiting for my album in the mail.  I just got into Periphery is why I love the new album!
p11783
aVI can't justify spending so much money purchasing music, especially as a student, and last time I attempted to use Spotify the library was noticeably bare, on several occasions I was simply unable to listen to the music I wanted to listen to because it was not present on Spotify. Not a fan of the ads or the fact you can't listen to high quality music without a subscription.\u000a\u000aJustify it through the purchase of merchandise and seeing bands live, additionally it does more for the band than purchasing physical albums according to figures I've seen. Circulation of their music, so fans hear the music and come to shows/buy merch is more important to bands than record sales.
p11784
aVI will track future album releases for bands I like then usually torrent upon release. If I like the album, then I'll go ahead and purchase it, if not, I won't buy it. As a student, I can't justify spending money on every album, regardless if I like it or not. I'll find ways to support the bands I like (through band websites, merch), but record labels with outdated business models who I know wont be giving much of my money to the artist have earned no sympathy from me. \u000a\u000aTl;Dr: I try my best to support the bands directly, while avoiding paying record labels with business models built for the 20th century.
p11785
aVFoobar2000 as my player and I pirate most of my music and buy things from smaller bands or things I really like. \u000a\u000aYou people using iTunes disgust me....
p11786
aVI used to use Winamp for a while to organize my music on my computer, but I just found it more convenient in the past year and half or so to just use iTunes, because of iPhone compatibility. \u000a\u000aiTunes isn't horrible IMO, but definitely far from the best.
p11787
aVI buy the album if it's one of my favorite bands, and for the rest I just download it.

aVPandora.  I pay for it so I can skip several songs on my stations if I don't like to hear them.  My Dethklok, BTBAM, and Zao stations get the most play.
p11793
aVI download leaks and listen to them in MediaMonkey, plus I pay for Google Play Music, so once albums release I just listen on there.
p11794
aVI used to download like crazy. I'd spend hours downloading albums, then organizing them properly, then putting them into itunes. Then I got a spotify account and I stopped downloading after that. 
p11795
aVGoogle Play Music All Access\u000a\u000aI find Google Play to be more robust than Spotify.  The library for their "All Access" paid subscription has rarely felt limited to me; right on par with Spotify.  You can host your mp3s in the cloud using Google Play, so songs you have downloaded as mp3 will seamlessly integrate into the rest of your All Access library when you upload them.  The mp3 locker feature caused me to jump ship from Spotify and I'm not looking back
p11796
aVI love Google Play. I pay for an account for myself, and my girlfriend. The fact that I can add any music on the play store, to my library with a click of a button is fantastic. I also love how easy it is to access on other devices, especially when I am able to sign in to chrome and have it load all my settings. Not only that, but being able to jump to the music video for the song is awesome. I was hesitant about paying for it, when Pandora is free, but I have not regretted my decision in the slightest, nor the decision to get my girlfriend an account, since I signed up. 
p11797
aVCDs all the way for me! That are of course put onto my computer, and then my phone/Ipod. \u000a\u000aI'm liking this spotify idea though...

aVPiracy. Why would I buy music when I can get it for free? I support my artists by going to concerts and buying merch. And buying a song off of iTunes hardly even helps the artist, iTunes keeps most of the dollar you spent on the song.

aVI press play
p11803
aVI love Spotify on my desktop, but I am a completionist and love to say that I bought that  album. I also enjoy having all my music with me without using cellular.  Pirating music is different from pirating movies. I generally watch a movie once or twice. However, I listen to a song hundreds or thousands of times. I am morally opposed to pirating music.

aVHaste the Day, specifically the song When Everything Falls.  Oooooh that intro. \u000a\u000aAfter that it was Every Time I Die's Gutter Pheonomenon before I back pedaled to Hot Damn.

aVI was a huge fan of Alesana in high school - eventually I found an Asking Alexandria song that featured Shawn Milke. So I guess for me it started with Alesana but the first metalcore band I was a fan of was Asking Alexandria and Elton John.

p11913
aVI lied to myself for a while, trying to justify my purchase of RF. I gave up after a week.
p11914
aVI didn't buy it (thankfully) but the first time I heard it I was kind of into it like "i guess i can see where they're going with this" and by the second listen i was like "wait a minute, no i can't" and then after a third listen three weeks later i was like "yeah fuck this album"
p11915
aVI bought a physical copy on the day of release. At first I was like "this could grow on me, so I'll give it a chance". It didn't.

aVI don't think I've even given my physical copy a spin yet.
p11917
aVSame pretty much
p11918
aVSame here with Restoring Force. I kinda liked some of the songs when it released, but quickly got bored with them. Any remaining appeal they had was destroyed by this sub a long time ago lol.\u000a\u000aStill jamming Sempiternal though.

p11924
aVI would say Restoring Force but it's not entirely true.  I tried really hard to like it when it came out but I just found myself resenting it even more.
p11925
aVNot metalcore to be exact, but mine's gotta be Through Art We Are All Equals by Slaves.\u000a\u000aIt was great at first, but it slowly became 'Meh' to the point that i became dissapointed in it. There are some great songs that i still listen till today, but the whole album was kinda forgettable as a whole. Easily JC's weakest project to date.
p11926
aVI've listened to the album a few times, but the only song that really stuck out to me was My Soul is Empty and Full of White Girls
p11927
aVThat song, The Fire Down Below &amp; This Is You Throwing In The Towel are the only songs I'm hooked with. The other songs are easily forgettable.
p11928
aVYeah, The Fire Below wasn't bad either
p11929
aVI feel like anything by JC gets old pretty fast. He just sings the same melodies over and over again.
p11930
aVBro do you even DGD
p11931
aVProbably everything Demon Hunter. They were the band that got me into metalcore and I listened to them for over a year. Since they were my gateway band I did not know any other bands. I still enjoy them occasionally, but I have expanded my horizons to pretty much all metalcore, deathcore, and melodic hardcore ever made.
p11932
aVI'm right there with you on this one. I loved Demon Hunter, and I still know that they are pretty cool, but whenever I listen to anything they do now I like it for about 3 days then leave it for like 4 years before I give it a single spin, and repeat. Just no spark there for me any more.
p11933
aVI'm ashamed, but when ETID - Ex-Lives came out, I listened to it a few times and just shelved it in favour for the previous work. I then listened to it randomly one day on the way from work and it just clicked with me, and now it's probably in my top three ETID records.

p11971
aVI had no idea what style i liked. I would just randomly search every style until after an hour i find a one song. For example healer i found on "breakdown top's" on youtube. But I looked other breakdown and nothing fitted me. So i decided apart randomly searching, I would ask for your help so you would point me at least in a direction i should search.\u000a\u000aI guess the style I should search up: is called melodic hardcore. Thanks.\u000a\u000aI enjoy the hard singing part- it get's me hyped for the lift, but ,i guess, I like cleaner vocal on chorus part. In healer, pre chorus part and chorus part is clean- at least for me. The problem is it's kind of hard for me to find a good song with clean,but hard/heavy vocal+melodic music (healer fits perfectly). On Asthma attack- After phrase "No Mercy" I know I have to lift, even if there is no vocal that instrumental part is very motivating for me.\u000a\u000aThe ghost inside- mercy didn't fitted me. But from their album song: Move on, looked great for me, added it to the playlist for example.

aVGoodbye Graceful by FiR. The rest of their music does nothing for me, but that is one catchy song.
p12006
aVI'm not exactly a fan of FiR, but theyre first album definitely has songs I enjoy.\u000a\u000aI'd say about half of the songs on that album are pretty good. At the very least it shows that they have the talent to be really good, they just decide not to be. Hopefully their new album changes that\u000a
p12007
aVI love FiR's first album, except for like two tracks. The only track I don't really like is Sink or Swim. 
p12008
aVThat's one of the tracks I really liked haha. I'm not as much of a fan of songs like I'm Not A Vampire but I definitely like their heavier stuff. They have some really nice guitar work and sometimes Ronnie does things that are definitely reminiscent of DIYLF era, and I love that
p12009
aVI'm definitely the opposite haha. I'm Not a Vampire, Tragic Magic, and Pick Up the Phone are my favorite tracks. They can write some really catchy stuff.

p12019
aVWould You Still Be There by OMAM. I hate everything those guys touch, but I've always loved Aaron's vocals since he was in Jamie's Elsewhere, and he's the main focus of the song...couple that with the chorus which is catchy as balls...I just enjoy it.

Especially the riff at 1:30. It's like Carnifex's track [Hope Dies With the Decadent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOsc0hEES0), just not quite as good. 
p12035
aVHaha you just know from that riff from Destruction of a Statue that the guitarists had to have been fans of Unholy Confessions by A7X. It's the like deathcore version of that riff.
p12036
aVI don't know the riff of Unholy Confessions of the top of my head, but I think the SS one is knocking off At the Gates' album [Slaughter of the Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzLhT39DSE0). 
p12037
aVThat's pretty damn close, but I'm positive that you could layer [A7X's drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-QaFWURsMU) over SS's riff and it would be perfect.
p12038
aVI hear it. \u000a\u000aI think SS just straight up stole the riff. It sounds EXACTLY the same. \u000a\u000aI think both are going for the Slaughter of the Soul sound though. 
p12039
aVYeah I'm pretty sure if you go back far enough you trace nearly all riff based metalcore and deathcore to At The Gates. That's some good stuff there.

p12062
aVMini story!  \u000aI was at one of Shikari's first ever shows, nobody knew to do the *clap-clap-clap* bit so the band did it themselves. I distinctly remember saying to my friend "That's so fucking stupid, it will *never* catch on".  \u000a\u000aI was a moron.

p12067

p12068
aVI liked Disgusting better.
p12069
aVGood for you

aVI didn't mean that in an asshole-ish way, sorry about that
p12072
aVWow, I thought this sub liked Disgusting. I admit it wasn't as good as Sick but I still enjoyed it.
p12073
aVI enjoyed it as well, I was just very disappointed by it after how great Sick was
p12074
aVYeah, everything on Disgusting is really subpar to Sick. The songs were just really boring, and weirdly enough'm. This was my least favorite song on Sick. I like Go Be The Voice way more, that bass breakdown... Mmmmmmm.
p12075
aVMy father has been an alcoholic for over 14 years and used to verbally and physically abuse me when I was little. When Beartooth dropped Disgusting and I heard Beaten In Lips, and paired it with this song, the shit hit home HARD. One day he coerced me to take him to the liquor store in the next town over ( He has no car and his license is expired.) because I wanted to pick something up as well. On the way back I played this song and Beaten In Lips in my car quite loud. Halfway through this song he turned the radio down threw a hissy fit, but I'm glad it hit him as hard as it hit me. People may have their problems with this band, but Caleb is a fucking monster vocalist and he's better here than he was in Attack Attack. Fuck yeah.

aVI personally didn't like Attack Attack! but Beartooth are sick.
p12088
aVI just remember the first time I heard this song. It was right after Caleb released it for the first time and my friend messaged me to listen to it. I remember sitting on my computer and pulling up the video and just that feeling of being smashed in the face came over me when this song it. Not too many experiences when a song had such a powerful punch the first time I listen to it. 
p12089
aVSaw these guys open for August Burns Red two years ago. Weird lineup, though.\u000a\u000aFirst you have Beartooth winning over a crowd with some sick mosh, then Defeater ruined the mood of the entire room by playing some depressing, inappropriate shit.\u000a\u000aLuckily Blessthefall were next to restore the mood and bring the fun back, with ABR capping off the night and providing the sickest mosh.\u000a\u000aMoral of the story: never seeing Defeater live again. Fuck that. 
p12090
aVNo. Nope. \u000a\u000aOpposite for me, blesathefall was very meh while Defeater was one of the best live shows I've ever seen. See them if you can people. 
p12091
aVWhat makes Defeater inappropriate here? I get that they seem kind of out of place on the tour, but their music has a lot of heavy, mosh-worthy moments. It sounds like you already had some kind of preconceived notion that Defeater would be "depressing, inappropriate shit".
p12092
aVThe pit went crazy for them at the date of that tour I was at
p12093
aVI would go ham too. Sure, the lyrical content is a bit heavy-handed at times, but holy hell if they don't have some bangers in their repertoire.
p12094
aVDefinitely, also it was their hometown show
p12095
aVSaw this tour too. Defeater were great, however, they had no place on that tour. Beartooth/ Defeater and ABR are close friends and ABR and Blessthefall are close friends so I bet it was such a bro tour to be on but Defeater should be touring with Citizen and Turnover not these super energetic bands. Hundredth or Counterparts would have been a solid replacement for Defeater imo. 
p12096
aVI went to that tour mainly for Defeater. Beartooth and ABR were just a nice bonus.
p12097
aVI went to that tour and actually only got a bad impression from Beartooth, not even because of the music though, just one of the guitarists being a douche to security who wasn't even doing anything wrong, just their normal job. I feel like that sort of plays a role in the back of my mind in why I haven't hopped on the hype train for them. Idk. I don't like seeing band members being assholes to people who don't deserve it.  I've listened to their stuff though, I don't hate it or anything. 
p12098
aVI went to that tour too and me and my friends felt the same way! pretty boring but at least they were passionate I give them that
p12099
aVI went to the tour and enjoyed every band a lot, don't see the problem, that tour is actually what got me really into Defeater\u000a\u000aEdit: Maybe it was just because it was their hometown show, but the crowd had a ton of energy when Defeater was playing
p12100
aVIt wasn't just me. Defeater's depressing as shit lyrics killed the mood of the entire venue. There were maybe 3 people really into them, everyone else was standing their crossarmed. Luckily BtF was next and had the whole place moshing and crowd surfing.\u000a\u000aMust have just been a bad night for Defeater. I dunno. They definitely didn't win me over, though. \u000a\u000aThanks for the downvotes for posting an opinion you don't agree with.

aVMy first thought when I saw the thread. I don't think anyone can dispute it. 
p12107
aVI think he still has it , he's just taking a shitty fucking direction trying to be one of those uplifting bands teens listen to to feel better. It's a shame that this is how they followed up the flood. Even after Shayley left those 4 songs on the reissue sounded pretty damn good and super heavy. Also they ruined Aaron pauley
p12108
aVDefinitely Garrett Rapp, his cleans are still great, but his "screams" are terrible now
p12109
aVAnd his cleans suffer because of his screams. 
p12110
aVI have no idea about that, the cleans on the last album still sounded pretty good, thought not like they were on My Devil in Your Eyes, no idea about what they're like live now though, since I've never seen them
p12111
aVI liked his screams on know hope. They gave the band a refreshing edge , that being said the touring and trying to write a second album within the year ruined his voice for good. Apparently he's shit live now.

p12114
aVIn my opinion, Mike Hranica. It may be blasphemous but I just really couldn't get into 8:18 and even parts of Dead Throne because I felt that his voice just became hollow to me. I REALLY enjoyed Plagues and WRAABB, they just seem to have more passion and emotion.
p12115
aVOn top of that, he only hits about 60% of the lyrics live and is unable to sustain a scream for more than 2-3 seconds. 
p12116
aVwhen i saw tdwp live the instrumentals completely took over his voice. like you could barely hear the screams
p12117
aVAs much as it kills me, I have to agree with you. 
p12118
aVGonna second Mike. I loved his vocals on their first few albums. One of my favorite harsh vocalists. But now his voice is so shrill and it sounds like he inhaled helium before screaming. \u000a\u000aAnd to add my own: Tomas Lindberg, he's not metalcore, but he's gone downhill.
p12119
aVI have to say Craig Mabbitt. I really liked him when he was in Blessthefall, but I don't think he's nearly as good in Escape the Fate as he was back then.
p12120
aVHave you heard of Dead Rabbitts? I'd say he's better than he was in BTF/TWA with the new DR album.
p12121
aVYes, Shapeshifter's great
p12122

aVSay what you like about Matty Mullins,  but he's a great vocalist.
p12125
aVI just think he sounded better on Challenger over Unconditional, especially with [Vices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_yCTsL3pOU)
p12126
aVWhile I've never been a huge MMF fan, I think one of the main reasons the vocals on Unconditional were so bad was the terrible production on that album
p12127
aV[deleted]
p12128
aVI've been saying this since Unconditional came out. The dude is an egotistical douche who unironically wears fedoras and loves jesus, but he has a killer fucking voice.
p12129
aVDefinitely agree with them. But I don't necessarily think Oli has gotten worse. His low grows are insanely good now. Its just his highs that are a bit worse.
p12130
aVI think he's gotten better at singing and his screams still sound good, but if he could mix the way he sings now with the screams he had on Suicide Season, it would be amazing
p12131
aVI have to disagree about Levi Benton, sure, his voice sounds a lot rougher, but I still really enjoyed their last album, and when I saw them last month, he sounded great
p12132
aVI like their last album too, and I saw them a few weeks ago too and thought they were great, I just think he was better on AAFtW and Monument
p12133
aVI actually liked their new album the most, but I definitely thought Monument and AAFTW were better than At Heart
p12134
aVThe clean vocals are what ruin Miss May I after AAFTW for me... I still like Levi's screams through all their material.
p12135
aVI thought the cleans on Monument were their best, and the other albums they were just sort of meh, I mostly listen to them for the screaming and riffs, not the cleans anyway
p12136
aVNot sure if the guy from Abandon All Ships was ever good, but now he's just awful
p12137
aVHe was always shit. He just got progressively shittier. 
p12138
aVThe only progressive thing about Abandon All Ships
p12139
aVSick burn.
p12140
aVMatt Tuck, oh Jesus has that gone downhill. Garret Rapp and Telle Smith have also had a drop in quality from what I've heard.
p12141
aVMatty Mullins. Not because his screaming's got worse, just that it sounds much more produced now. He used to be one of my favorites.
p12142
aVThey (MMF) have said that they disliked the production of the last record, so that could change on the next one, hopefully. 
p12143
aVI'm pretty sure Matty actually built a studio with that guy, he's probably going to keep doing their albums.
p12144
aVI can't tell if Telle Smith has gotten worse, or if his harsh vocals were just layered so heavily back on their first couple albums that he sounded much more capable than he actually was. Whatever the case, his mid and low ranges are pretty mediocre now. His highs are still sweet though.
p12145
aVI dunno man, Telle's live performances during the past couple years are the only reason I even own any TWA albums to begin with. 
p12146
aVI don't think he's bad at all, his higher end live is intense for sure, but the growls we heard on Deceiver are gone.
p12147
aV I kind of get the gist that he was never really comfortable in the low range and that Deceiver only gave an impression that he was through production.  Either way Telle sounds great live and his voice fits the music well.
p12148
aVDeceiver definitely sounds better vocally than Life Cycles or Real, not sure what's up
p12149
aVThere was a lot less/almost no effects or production on his voice on Life Cycles or Real. 
p12150
aVgoing to be an unpopular opinion here but I loved Caleb's vocals back in the S/T AA album. I guess he improved immensely since then but I wish he would still mix his old vocal style in with the one he has now
p12151
aVHis new style fits with Beartooth and his old style fit with the self titled. I like the change. 
p12152
aVDefinitely. Attack Attack (S/T) was an amazing album. His vocals kicked ass in Smokahontas.
p12153
aVI agree completely. I liked where be took Attack Attack! after Carlisle left. It might have been cheesy in a sense trying to follow trends and go for a more heavy sound but I loved their Self Titled. Everything after that, including Beartooth, has just been real disappointing in my eyes.
p12154
aVI'm gonna go with Austin Carlile, but unfortunately I have to say Mike Hranica belongs in this discussion as well.
p12155
aVI'm going to see TDWP at the opening date for the Zombie EP tour, but I've never seen them live before. What do you think is "wrong" per se with Mike's vocals now? I saw above where someone else said his mids and lows weren't as good, but I also heard they changed the way they recorded his vocals, which impacts the sound on their more recent albums.
p12156
aVHe seems exhausted from the beginning of their set. He sweats profusely just a few songs in and phones it in at times. Obviously I'm not expecting him to scream every line of every song, but sometimes he just seems tired. And his vocals are recorded differently. Not saying I don't like his performances on the records, but his live performances are kind of sad at this point. He just seems so exhausted.
p12157
aV:(
p12158
aVTrust me, it makes me sadder than anything else on this planet because TDWP is my favourite band of all time, but I really don't think Mike's gonna be able to make it much longer in terms of touring on a consistent basis. If he has to limp to the barn to get through tours, I'd rather see TDWP break up. Fortunately, I don't think that's imminent and I still think Mike can make it through tours, but 5 or so years from now...well...
p12159
aVI hear yah. I'd rather my favorite bands split while I still love them they stay around and turn to shit.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a/nojerk Your constant jerking of TDWP is what made give them a second chance, and now I love them too /jerk

aVGuess you have a point, I hopped in miss may I when I listened to "hey mister" so I probably just haven't noticed it.
p12171
aVNot metalcore, but Bendan from Counterparts' vocals are starting to go a bit downhill. He just seems constantly out of breath and tired live now compared to in 2011.\u000a\u000aBit of an unpopular opinion, but Phil Bozeman. His highs on TSD were fucking ruthless, but now they  just sound substantially less angry and aggressive. Don't get me wrong, Phil is still better than 95% of vocalists in the scene, but I'd kill for Phil's screams to sound as good as they did on TSD
p12172

p12173
aVHe sounds the EXACT same as he did in severed ties. Sounds EXACTLY the same live too. Joel still has his touch.

aVThe popular consensus among A7X fans is that M Shadows' vocals have only gotten better. Sure, he can't scream too well anymore, but that's not a big deal considering they've ditched metalcore a long time ago. And yeah, Matt Heafy's screams aren't as potent as they used to be, but considering how long Trivium has been around, his vocals are still damn good
p12178
aVSaw them both live at Mayhem and can tell you they both perform incredibly well and their voices actually sound on par to the albums they make.
p12179
aVI completely agree, I saw both at Mayhem last year. What did you think about Trivium's set?
p12180
aVI thought it looked great. I loved the gigantic banner of the album behind them. The only thing I was disappointed in was the crowd. Trivium tried so fucking hard to hype up the crowd and nobody wanted to get off their butt and enjoy it. Eventually a good chunk of the crowd gave in once they saw what a fantastic performance they gave. they sounded identical if not better (more energetic) tithe album. His voice was dead on.
p12181
aVEvery time I see Trivium the whole band is on point. Matt is a great front man, and when I saw them in 2013 was arguably their worst performance I've seen by them, and it was still perfect. You could just tell he was tired. He still hyped everyone up, still conversed with the audience, Matt's a beast. I'm not really into their music, but I will go see them every time they come to town, because I respect the shit out of those guys for working that hard, all the time.
p12182
aVI'm still pissed as hell about that, a7x had to stop midset because of a storm and then the festival people just told everyone to go home.
p12183
aVThat's so rough!
p12184
aVMatt's cleans have gotten hugely better (at least through Nightmare), and while he can't scream well anymore, he can still scream a little. The worst part, IMO, is that they haven't really had many good songs in a while. To me Nightmare was just meh, and HTTK was a huge step back. Haven't really liked anything from them since the self titled. Nightmare would be good if I had been told its from another band, but from them it seems a little disappointing. They used to be my favorite band but you can't have two sub-par releases and expect to stay there. Doesn't help that my favorite genre moves around quite a bit.
p12185
aVThey just need to quit steadily getting softer and softer, and actually play some fucking music. I accidentally let HTTK play a couple of songs the other day, and while I was in the other room I thought I heard soft Metallica. Shame on A7X for letting it get this far.

aVI really like this and sleepless nights, but other than that it just fell flat.
p12194
aVI feel the video shows a goofier side of the band, especially considering the album had lyrics that felt really serious. I liked solely because it looked like the band had a blast making the video and it wasn't just a Matty-centric thing.

aVI am going to absolutely lose my shit if there will be any high quality recordings of this.

aVIt should be pretty rad!  In 2010 Phil from All that Remains filled in for Howard in KSE and it was way sweet.  Anyway, seeing FFAK and ABR Tuesday and I'm super excited.
p12228
aVAhhh.. Philswitch Engage. One of my most favorite shows I've been to.
p12229
aVFirst comment in Metalcore to actually make me laugh out loud. Congrats
p12230
aVHaha, you laugh but that's what they called themselves on the tour and they had shirts with the name! I would link the image, but it won't let me for some reason. Google "Philswitch Engage" and its the first image.

aVThat is fantastic. Wish I could have been there.

aVAwwww thanks man. You're too kind. 
p12234
aVI remember that tour. That was 5 years ago already?!  Wow. 
p12235
aVThat always sucks when their on tour and their pipes are just thrashed. I know how I feel after being in the pit screaming all night, imagine being on tour. So jealous though, really want to see them live again. 
p12236
aVJB tweeted that Jake had the flu, so it's at least not that his voice messed up. 
p12237
aVHe did a damn good job. Levi ended up singing for Fault Line and White Washed. They all did great. 
p12238
aVAnd Northlane and erras vocalists each did a song, right? 
p12239
aVYeah. I honestly don't remember which songs. And they ended up making a few instrumental as well. 
p12240
aVpart of me secretly hopes he has to do vox for friday's show as well, just so i can see it. 
p12241
aVSee you in the pit dude! 
p12242
aVyou probably will. 6'6, long hair. let's go!
p12243
aV6 foot, short hair (I know, it's a dumb username...) and a red Phinehas tank! \u000a\u000aSee you then Mr. Tree
p12244
aVah yes, the Heavy Duty Mustache Metal tank!
p12245
aVNot that one unfortunately, but it's like 32 hours! Hype is really real! 
p12246
aVSO REAL. I'll be wearing a Darkness Divided tank, probably. we gotta meet up and throw down.

VMetalcore: Fit For a King - Slave to Nothing\u000a\u000aNon-metalcore: Defeater - Letters Home, Silverstein - This is How the Wind Shifts
p12255
aVthis is how the wind shifts is amazing
p12256
aVDefeater is such an awesome band.  I love their music.  I've been listening to them as well
p12257
aVThat Silverstein record is my shit.
p12258
aVDID I FORGET WHO I WAAAAAAAS???!!
p12259
aVMetalcore: Issues self titled\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: This Wild Life - Clouded (One of the most chill-est albums I've ever listened to)
p12260
aVMetalcore: In Hearts Wake - Divination\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: letlive. - Fake History
p12261
aVFake History is so damn good I'm hype as shit for their new album.
p12262
aVMetalcore: I, The Breather - Life Reaper\u000a\u000aNon-metalcore: Hands Like Houses - Unimagine
p12263
aVUnimagine is my favorite album of all time. Their first  album Ground Dweller is also very good.
p12264
aVTotally agree. Haven't stopped jamming it since they put it out. Every song is such a work of art. 
p12265
aVNot much new at the moment, but Metalcore: I recently just discovered Volumes - No Sleep and Non-metalcore: PVRIS - White Noise, definitely must listen to this and looking forward to seeing them at Slam Dunk festival. 
p12266
aVI tried PVRIS out awhile ago and I didn't see all of the hype. Is there any songs you would recommend I should listen to or should I just go listen to the new album straight through?  
p12267
aVJust go listen to the entire album. It grows on you hardcore. I hated their single ,My House, until I started to listen to them regularly. The whole record just fantastic. Just give it a chance trust me. 
p12268
aVHoly, St. Patrick, My House and White Noise! Eyelids too. They're all amazing actually. You just have to listen actively with an open mind.
p12269
aVMetalcore: Periphery - Juggernaut (legendary, 10/10 would bleed on the inside again)\u000a\u000aNon: Enter Shikari - The Mindsweep (sexy, 8/10, sorry its a winner)\u000a
p12270
aVI was going to post the same answer until I saw someone already did the hard work for me. 
p12271
aVAgree with Periphery although not sure if they're classified as Metalcore? :/
p12272
aVEnough to be this subreddits artist of the month last month :p \u000a\u000aFrom a broad perspective, they sure are metalcore. But I can see the argument for them not to be if we're getting nitpicky. 
p12273
aVMetalcore: In Hearts Wake - Divination &amp; Earthwalker\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: Palisades - Mind Games
p12274
aVDivination is definitely one of my favorite albums in metalcore.\u000a\u000aEarthwalker had good songs too but I felt like it couldn't live up to the previous album.
p12275
aVMetalcore: Invent, Animate - Everchanger\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: Leviathan - Scar-Sighted, Misyrming - Sngvar elds og reiu, and Void Ritual's split with Barshasketh have been making the rounds.
p12276
aVwe're like the same person. well, not listening to those BM albums in specific, but rare to find people who like BM and metalcore! 
p12277
aVMetalcore: Motionless In White - Infamous (Such an overlooked album, I love it.)\u000aNon-Metalcore: The Classic Crime - The Silver Cord 
p12278
aVThe Classic Crime rocks. I've been listening to them for years. 
p12279
aVI love them. I came across their Albatross album years ago but never listened to it enough. Then I downloaded The Silver Cord during my first deployment in 2009 so I was pretty late to the game. Since then though they're a huge chunk of what I listen to now. Lol.
p12280
aVMetalcore: Oceans Ate Alaska - Lost Isles (I can't find something I dislike about this album)\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: Twenty One Pilots - Vessel (The way they write the lyrics is just marvelous)  
p12281
aVMetalcore: ETID- From Parts Unknown\u000a\u000aNon- Rob Scallon (Self Titled)
p12282
aVdon't shoot me or anything, but I just can't get into From Parts Unknown. some songs on it I really like, but I HARDLY think its their best album. 
p12283
aVI don't judge man. I don't think it's their best, but the question *was* your favorite at the moment. FPU is their newest so that's what I've been listening to.
p12284
aVfair enough. I wasn't trying to bash the album, nor your pick. Just tried to get some discussion going :P
p12285
aVAbsolutely nothing wrong with that!
p12286
aVMetalcore: Glass Cloud - The Royal Thousand \u000a\u000aNon Metalcore: The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza - Danza llll \u000a\u000a\u000aObsessed with Josh Travis's style lol
p12287
aVI've been meaning to check out The Royal Thousand. Any particular songs I should go to first, or should I just play it in sequence?
p12288
aVThe entire thing. All of the songs are perfect imo except maybe Memorandum. It's not bad, just my least favorite. \u000a\u000aEdit: if you do check out any songs in particular, listen to Ivy &amp; Wine, All Along, or Falling In Style. 
p12289
aVhaha yeah, Ivy &amp; Wine (or was it Ivory &amp; Wine?) was what inspired the need to hear the whole thing. that particular song came on while in a spotify radio playlist I was in, and I thought it was fantastic.
p12290
aVIt's Ivy &amp; Wine lol but it's become one of my favorite metalcore albums. I really like their EP because it's more Danza-esque, but it's still not as good as TRT imo
p12291
aVmetalcore: Chapters-Adestria  \u000aNon metalcore: innocence and instinct-Red
p12292
aVMetalcore: Periphery - Alpha/Omega \u000a\u000aNon-metalcore: Deadmau5 - while(1&lt;2)
p12293
aVGreat release by Periphery. One band I've never had the privilege of seeing live. 
p12294
aVMetalcore - Singularity, Slave to Nothing and, Earthwalker  \u000a  \u000aNon-Metalcore - The Hunter, Yellow &amp; Green and, Descensus 
p12295
aVMetal core - Erra Augment and new EP\u000a\u000aNon - Wind in Sails - Morning Light
p12296
aVI love Erra
p12297
aVMetalcore: Beartooth - Disgusting\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: Fall Out Boy - AB/AP
p12298
aVI have recently been listening to Architects - Lost Forever // Lost Together. I wasn't really into them before, but checked the new album out because of all the hype here. I really like it.\u000a\u000aNon-metalcore I have been jamming Just Like You by Falling In Reverse. Aside from a few songs the album is really bloody great. It totally redeemed the band in my eyes (musically, Ronnie is still a twat.)
p12299
aVMetalcore: Periphery Juggernaut: Alpha and Omega\u000a\u000aNon-metalcore: I'm a huge Hollywood Undead fan and even though it's not out yet I'm liking every song released from Day of the Dead so far, and like their 3 previous albums I think I'll love it.
p12300
aVFrom Parts Unknown and Run the Jewels 2

aVMetalcore: Deep Blue\u000a\u000aNon Metalcore: Vessel, twenty one pilots

p12320
aVMetalcore: definitely The Last Word Is Yours To Speak by Phinehas. Those guys go so fucking hard. \u000a\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: + by Ed Sheeran. Didn't ever really listen to the dude because he's the favorite artist of a chick that burned me hard. But I just started listening to him, and his music and his personality (from the interviews and shit I've watched) have inspired me to pick up the guitar again and actually learn it.

p12324
aVMetalcore: Silent Planet - The Night God Slept\u000a\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: Counterparts - The Difference Between Hell and Home
p12325
aVMetalcore: Monuments - The Amanuensis. It's just so good, I regret not getting into this band until about a week ago!\u000a\u000aNon: Pretty much Insomnium's discography. Melodic Death Metal combined with doom metal type song writing and it's all beautiful 
p12326
aVI've been listening to Insomnium for awhile. Absolutely amazing stuff. 
p12327
aVMetalcore: Silent Planet - The Night God Slept \u000aNon-metalcore: Being As An Ocean - Dear G-d...
p12328
aVI just saw Being As An Ocean with STYG. They put on a great show, tremendous amount of energy. Is this their best album?\u000a
p12329
aVDear G-d... is more post-hardcore, but their newest album, How We Both Wondrously Perish, is more melodic-hardcore. They also got a new drummer and guitar player/singer, so the albums sound somewhat different from each other. To sum it up, they're both great, I just happen to be rockin Dear G-d... lately
p12330
aVI thought it was the other way around, Dear G-d was more melodic hardcore and the new album was more PHC
p12331
aVI agree, I'm assuming that's what YoloMcSwaggingtons meant as it seems like a pretty clear shift from melodic hardcore to a more post-hardcore sound.
p12332
aVWhoops, I got mixed up, you're right
p12333
aVMetalcore: Taken-Between Two Unseens/Issues-Issues\u000a\u000aNon-Metalcore: Xibalba-Tierra Y Libertad/Ces Cru-Constant Energy Struggles
p12334
aVnew xibalba is tight 
p12335
aVright? I dig the more prevalent Death Metal influence, and it really brings the mosh.
p12336
aVits like the only "deathcore" album that sounds like death metal with hardcore bits that ive heard, so good
p12337
aVyou ever jam any Despised Icon or Animosity? Both bands have equal amounts Hardcore and Death Metal in their sound imo.
p12338
aVdespised icon was so good, i should check out animosity

aVYou're just splitting hairs with subgenres. The difference between metalcore and rap is much greater than the difference between metalcore and deathcore. Plus this post actually got more attention on here than it did on r/deathcore. It isn't even about music necessarily, it's asking to help out musicians. Who cares about the genre here, they need help not listens. Injury or not, their gear and van got totalled.

aVFirst of all: have a great show!\u000aI recommend knowing your music so well you could do it in your sleep. That way if nerves kick in, you'll know what you're doing. \u000a

aVHaven't recorded yet, this show is kind of our debut.  We're a Chicago four-piece hardcore punk band.  So far, we've written enough for an EP, we just need to record.  It's hard to find time for that when we all have so much schoolwork all the time.  On friday, we'll be playing an original and a cover of Subliminal by Suicidal Tendencies.  We only have a two song set cause we're opening for plenty of other bands.

aVI can only tell you, MOVE.\u000a\u000aYou're gonna be nervous, you're probably going to mess up a lot, but that all comes with the territory. But there's nothing worse than watching musicians perform and they're frozen. (Unless you're playing super complex shit) \u000a\u000aSo just move around and have fun. You'll remember your first show for ever so don't over think it and just enjoy the moment. \u000a\u000a
p12433
aVDefinitely go nuts, but nothing you're uncomfortable with. I sing for my band, and I used to be a statue on stage, so when i decided to move I overcompensated a little bit. Make sure you still have lung capacity for what you do, don't be afraid to play off of the crowd (or look at them) and have fun!!
p12434
aVGood luck!  Make some funny faces and I'd be a happy guy!
p12435
aVStaying relaxed is key.  If you get too nervous you risk distracting yourself from playing the best show you can.  Reminding yourself that you're there to have a good time should help keep you grounded.  Have fun!

aVI remember hearing this song specifically for the first time and was like "WOAH I THOUGHT THESE GUYS WERE JUST SOUTHERN ROCK HOLY SHIT" and fell in love. Always has a place in my heart, but Hollow was surely my favorite. I don't understand Unconditional hate...I think it's better than Challenger.
p12530
aVI don't get the Unconditional hate either, but it certainly isn't better than Challenger. Challenger was a solid album for sure, whereas Matty's lyrics got more preachy and the mixing was off on Unconditional, which turned just about everyone off. 
p12531
aVYeah I don't know, I liked Challenger...but there was just something about it that I didn't like as much as Hollow or Unconditional. I'm Christian myself so that's probably why I like the new lyrics more haha, but no doubt The Hollow had the best lyrics by far.
p12532

VI'd guess TDWP, I really hope not, but I could see it. 
p12574
aVI can see this. I've watched interviews of these guys since I was a kid, and they just seem so tired. Mike especially seems like he just doesn't like metalcore or even his older work in TDWP much anymore.
p12575
aVThey've made it pretty clear that none of them are fans of their older work. 
p12576
aVHaven't they also stated that they're not really friends?\u000a\u000aThey get along with each other well enough, but when they're home, they never see each other. 
p12577
aVSounds like me and my co-workers, too...
p12578
aVI heard Mike say in an interview that they aren't each others *best* friends, but that they all get along. Plus they don't all live in the same place, so it makes sense that they wouldn't see each other when they aren't touring, writing, or recording.  
p12579
aVThis is how most real bands are. You're buddies on the road and in the studio but if you're touring extensively you need a break when you come home.
p12580
aVHow much of their old work don't they like? Just the first couple albums?
p12581
aVOnly the first album.  They play a few songs live here and there on Plagues.
p12582
aVI know they dislike Dear Love. I think they're pretty ok with the music from Plagues and Roots but I think they feel embarrassed by stuff like the goofy song titles.

aV[deleted]
p12589
aVI can see this. The last album was a definite step down and didn't sell as much. 
p12590
aVIt did not sell as much yes. But I would *definitely* not say it was a step down. 
p12591
aVMaybe they aren't "big," but A Skylit Drive. And that's exactly why I can see them being next. They've been around for *years* but have never seen much more than being a direct support band on many tours. Throw a ton of lineup changes in there, and the fact that they sound so similar to so many younger bands who completely passed them up on the way up the metalcore/post-hardcore ladder, I could see them finally putting it to rest. 
p12592
aVThis is definetly the one I see the most, on warped tour at least at the date I saw they were put on a stage that was mostly crappy local picked up for the tour bands and the little I saw of them they didn't seem very happy. 
p12593
aVEven, and unfortunately, bands like Ice Nine Kills who have been around for ages yet don't ever see real success. Its good to see INK getting some more exposure lately, but they've been playing the support game for a real long time. Being a supporting act for For All Those Sleeping and Capture the Crown, and now recently Motionless in White, must suck (or at least be discouraging) when you know you've been around twice as long. \u000a\u000aI hope they don't, though. They get much better with every album. 
p12594
aVTo be fair, Ice Nine Kills only recently started getting mainstream success (like 2012 onwards)\u000aI reckon they've still got a bit in them (considering they went from the Ernie Ball stage to Monster Energy stage in warped tour)\u000a\u000aA Skylit Drive haven't really gone places as much (they started off well and have gone down hill)\u000aWhilst Ice Nine Kills are only starting to go uphill (in my opinion)
p12595
aVNo, I definitely agree, you aren't wrong. INK is trending upward for sure, and hopefully the momentum carries them into bigger and better things. \u000a\u000aI was just saying bands *like them* that grind it out for *years* to see limited success, if at all, must get discouraged at some point(s). I don't see an INK breakup imminent though, they are heading in a good direction. Just using them as another example alongside A Skylit Drive. \u000a\u000aAnother one is the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. One huge debut single and a mildly successful debut album only to see numerous lineup changes (down to one original member) and stagnant album/tour success. Don't see them lasting much longer. Perhaps that was a better example than INK, I just used them as it was /u/coolbad96 's flair and they popped into my head.\u000a\u000aIronically, RJA and ASD are (or recently were) co-headlining a tour.  
p12596
aVIt's so crazy that INK has technically been around since 2002 or so, and they're just now getting some success.
p12597
aVI'm playing a show with them in March, they are touring with Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. 
p12598
aVLol yea I know about the tour, you should see my response to highelf04 above.\u000a\u000aPretty cool though, big ups to you and your band.
p12599
aVThanks man, they are definitely dying bands, but it will be a cool throwback show, 
p12600
aVI could also see their singer going solo, or getting with a more poppy style band. I feel like he has a voice that could make him popular with the masses. 
p12601
aVJag has a solo song already released...\u000aIt's not good...
p12602
aVHaha, I didn't say Me (or this sub) would like his solo music. But I could see him becoming more and more pop over time. 
p12603
aVUnfortunately you're probably right. One of my favorites but this lineup change is gonna fuck them up I think.

aVA skylit drive\u000a\u000aThey cancelled their last UK tour, and the one before was a big old flop (it's a sad moment when a support act is called out for 1 more song, and the main act isn't)\u000a\u000aThey lost a lot of momentum after Identity on fire, took too long to release Rise and haven't bought anything new to the table...
p12606
aVI can see Oh, Sleeper go into hiatus at least. With Shane getting on big tours with Wovenwar and the rest of the band trying to settle down, there's not much coming in the future.\u000a\u000aAnother candidate would be Capture the Crown, because the one dude who's left is in crazy debt right now. Either he convinces four others to share that with him or he's spending the rest of his life working his ass off.\u000a\u000aAnd finally, there's La Dispute. While there are not really signs that they'll break up, they're definitely going slower than they were in the times of *Somewhere...* and *Wildlife*. Jordan also once said in an interview that they no longer want to tour full time and rather focus on their own lives when they're not on tour/writing. So, maybe no breakup, but at least a hiatus.
p12607
aVO, S seems to basically be on hiatus in all but name really. \u000a\u000a\u000aAnd I hope not LA Dispute, I loved rooms of the house... 
p12608
aVI mean they literally said they were on hiatus, so.
p12609
aVThey are on touring hiatus but stuff is being written and recorded.
p12610
aVYeah a couple weeks ago micha posted a bad ass clip in the studio 
p12611
aVI don't think CtC is going to break up at least not this year they have a tour planned for this year. And they also have made a lot of twitter posts about big plans for this year. I know twitter is a huge promise but it looks like they wanna move foward.
p12612
aVI would say, and I hope not, but Alesana will probably release their new album, then I don't know after that. They have slowed up, gone on to do other things, starting their own label. 
p12613
aVYeah I can agree with you, but at least they would be pulling out while they are still sort of on top of their game. 
p12614
aVFinish the Annabel Trilogy dammit!
p12615
aVYeah. They seem to be moving so slowly, they'll probably just stop soon
p12616
aVI could see Escape the fate quitting soon. In interviews craig and Tj said dead rabbits is more fun and natural while etf has some legal issues and are getting tired of line up changes.
p12617
aVyep i could see this
p12618
aVThe Dead Rabbitts is way better anyways. I've been saying for awhile ETF should call it quits so TDR can get more attention. 
p12619
aVOn a side note, I really hope Max Green actually gets his band Violet New Breed up and running. They only have a couple songs out at the moment, but I'm excited to see more.
p12620
aVNot metalcore but Brokencyde\u000a\u000ahttp://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/it-turns-out-only-33-people-in-the-entire-world-want-a-new-brokencyde-album?utm_content=buffer20031&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer
p12621
aVrip BREEBREE
p12622
aVAll That Remains.
p12623
aVI've listened to both No Knock and This Probably Won't End Well and both songs damn near put me to sleep. If there will never be another Fall of Ideals, I think they'd be better hanging it up...all on good terms of course.
p12624
aVCouldn't agree more. Fall of Ideals was perfection. Honestly, their guitarist is way too talented to stop here though.
p12625
aVIt doesn't help that since A War You Cannot Win, Phil has been sneaking pro-libertarian lyrics into songs. I just sort of wish he'd keep his politics to himself.
p12626
aVNah, they've been singing about that stuff since at least Fall of Ideals. And I don't got a problem with it, I'd rather someone sing about politics and things that actually matter instead of stupid hope-core bullshit.
p12627
aVI agree with you on the hope-core stuff. I just feel like ranting about a very specific political agenda through your band's music can alienate your audience.
p12628
aVso can the christcore stuff, but you still see bands doing it
p12629
aVYou're right, lyrics can definitely alienate people if you don't agree with the message. I, for one, hardly ever even notice lyrics, so whether or not I agree with the message usually doesn't affect my listening experience x)
p12630
aValso he's a homophobic prick
p12631
aVIs he? I remember him making some derogatory remarks about Black Veil Brides. Phil's also a pain on social media, always spewing his shitty beliefs. Which is a shame, because everyone else in the band seem like cool people. It ultimately makes it very difficult to be a fan of the band, despite having made some of the best songs in this genre.
p12632
aVhe basically said that gay people don't have the right to feel persecuted or oppressed (especially when the word faggot is used) because they weren't made into slaves like black people were. guy is a fucking douche canoe
p12633
aVHe doesn't hate gay people and homophobe is a horrible word to describe him. He's just an asshole all around.
p12634
aVI'm putting all my money on Falling in Reverse. Mostly cause I hate them, but also cause Ronnie Radke is a ticking bomb from what I can tell.
p12635
aVHonestly, if their new album is going to be a DIYLF 2.0, then it's definitely going to get them more fans and more popularity than they already have. I hate FIR, but their new album seems pretty good so far ngl
p12636
aVI'm with you there. The new record will probably really take off, especially with the radio play they're getting with "God If You Are Above..."
p12637
aV^\u000a\u000aHuge fan of Ronnie-era Escape The Fate, not a huge fan of Falling In Reverse's stuff until I heard the two singles from the new album. I felt like I was in 2006 again, I'm now a Falling In Reverse fan (if the rest of the album is as good).
p12638
aVDon't see them losing any momentum or breaking up for lack of success any time soon, they're one of the biggest bands in the alternative scene.\u000a\u000aBut I guess Ronnie is always a potential concern. He seems to be doing alright though. That whole "firing his entire band" thing was just a hoax by the media, and he has yet to break his 6+ year sobriety streak. The whole band looks to be really good friends too, from a fan's standpoint. \u000a\u000aYep, I'm a FiR fan. Haha
p12639
aV/r/AntiRadkeWatch
p12640
aVI wish, mainly because I can't stand them. They are printing money though. That band is in a good financial state and the band gets along. No label will kick em off either because of the type of money they pull.
p12641
aVThis thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.\u000a\u000a\u000a - [/r/AntiRadkeWatch] [Haters will only make Falling In Reverse famous](http://np.reddit.com/r/AntiRadkeWatch/comments/2vqohv/haters_will_only_make_falling_in_reverse_famous/)\u000a\u000a\u000a*^If ^you ^follow ^any ^of ^the ^above ^links, ^respect ^the ^rules ^of ^reddit ^and ^don't ^vote ^or ^comment. ^Questions? ^Abuse?

p12642
aVnah, if anything Radke will get kicked from the band and they'll continue without him. (which they REALLY REALLY need to do)
p12643
aVthat is the last thing that is going to happen since it is his band
p12644
aVOh, Sleeper I guess. Shane has Wovenwar and the rest of the bands seems to be busy with their personal lives, house and kids, all that stuff. They're already on an hiatus.
p12645
aVI wouldn't be surprised about Asking Alexandria, as much of a problem as Danny was getting to be, he was sort of a major part of the band, and I don't think they'll last much longer.
p12646
aVI actually think theyre going to be around longer now that Danny isn't in the band
p12647
aVI'm not sure, it seems like with the new guy/playing Warped again, they're trying to just go back to their original fanbase, and I've noticed a lot of times, when a band tries too hard to go back to their "old sound", it's usually the beginning of the end
p12648
aVI think it all depends on how much of an influence Danny was over their latest sound. If he was the driving force behind it, and Ben and everyone else still have their heavy elements, then they make be able to make it work. This next album I think is going to determine a lot
p12649
aVIm excited to see what they do with their new album. I havent really been a fan of Reckless and Relentless or From Death to Destiny. R&amp;R was ok in my opinion. Stand Up and Scream is one of my favorite albums in this genre, so if they don't fuck up trying to get back to that style, i think it''ll be pretty rad.
p12650
aVI definitely agree with you there, it doesn't seem like Ben is too interested in the heavy stuff either though, which could be weird with how they seem to be trying to at least somewhat go back to their older sound
p12651
aVIdk, I haven't followed them since R&amp;R, so I have no idea what their interests are. If they put out good stuff, then great. If not, well wouldnt really bother me at all haha
p12652
aVYeah, I actually preferred FDTD, but as far as their future, I don't care too much, there are a bunch of bands I like a lot more, I just feel like they won't be around much longer
p12653
aVI feel like AA will still be the same, considering Ben writes most of the music.
p12654
aVHopefully they go back to their heavier sound and since I follow Ben on twitter he's hinted multiple times that they'll be going back to a 'heavier' sound.
p12655
aVThat's true, he does, I'm just not sure what the future's going to be like for them, not that I really care though, since I don't listen to them as much as I did about a year ago anyway
p12656
aVI gotcha, I'm the same way.\u000a\u000aAs long as A7x and BTF stay together, I'm good haha
p12657
aVI'm definitely hoping BTF stays together, great band
p12658
aVFor sure, and theyre only getting better
p12659
aVI agree, Hollow Bodies was probably my second favorite album from 2013, and I'm excited about what the new one's going to be like. Plus they're great live\u000a\u000aEdit: Actually probably my third favorite, forgot about Augment by Erra for a minute
p12660
aVI remember reading a tweet from Beau that said some of the riff's Erics been working have given him goosebumps. I'm so hyped for it.\u000a\u000aAnd theyre one of my favorite live bands. I can't wait to see them again at warped. I went to the Charlotte date last year and they were the last band to play and everyone was there. I was at the front and it was intense
p12661
aVSounds good, excited to see them again at Warped too, the 2013 Warped tour was the first time I saw them, and that was great.
p12662
aVFor sure
p12663
aVGive me some examples if you can.
p12664
aVNothing overly specific, but I've just noticed a pattern, where usually bands that are on the verge of falling off will try to reach out to their old fanbase in a desperate attempt to stay relevant. It seems like Escape the Fate is doing that now by playing Warped tour again, after playing more radio-rock shows for a while, and it's pretty obvious they won't be around much longer. Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is another band like that, who went after the radio crowd for a while, but now is coming back to the "scene" because they're not relevant anymore
p12665
aVNot sure if a joke oooooooooooor?
p12666
aVI'm not a huge fan of them in general, but I just don't think they're going to be around much longer, just my opinion
p12667
aVI think it depends on how they perform on Warped Tour, if people still go cray for them maybe they might do a few tours after. 
p12668
aVThat's true, I have a feeling that with the new vocalist though, they're just going to sound really generic, especially if they're really focusing on going back to their "old sound", which whether you like it or not, was very generic
p12669
aVWell... I HOPE Hellyeah calls it quits soon... I just want mudvayne back :( 
p12670
aVHow has no one said Memphis May Fire??
p12671
aVTheir latest album debuted at number 4 on the BillBoard 200. Mother fuckers ain't going anywhere any time soon. 
p12672
aVSure they are. They're going to other genres of music.
p12673
aVAw man I just got into them, I'd hate to see them go
p12674
aVParkway Drive. They did 2 tours in 2014 and haven't announced a single one for 2015 yet. I love them but they're about to split 
p12675
aVI honestly cant tell if youre joking Lol.Theyre still working on the album due this summer. Also theyre already playing two of the biggest german festivals Rock am Ring and Rock im Park.
p12676
aVThe people in this thread are hilarious. The ones denying a band will quit soon as if you have some information that the band isn't going to call it quits. Any band can be gone at anytime, no matter how successful they've been. 
p12677
aVFan girls just upset that someone would have the audacity to mention there favorite band might not make music for the rest of their lives.
p12678
aVParkway Drive.\u000aI saw them live on 8 december and damn, winston look so tired tbh.
p12679
aVThat would break my heart. Them, Killswitch, and ABR are really the last of the old guard from when I got into the scene.
p12680
aVBut Atreyu is back! The three you named, Atreyu, and BFMV are my five originals.
p12681
aVI never liked Atreyu. BFMV was up there though, so were ATR and HTD.\u000a\u000a(All these acronyms make me laugh... To an outsider this is gibberish)
p12682
aVAll respect to Atreyu, but unless they put out a record full of songs that are heavier than their newest single, it's gonna be hard for me to get back into them. I have all of their music, and enjoy each record, but I'd much rather have a new "The Curse" than a new "Lead Sails Paper Anchor". 
p12683
aVI'd burst into tears. Not actually, but i would be so damn upset. They're my favorite band, it would be such a shame to see them go. 
p12684
aVYeah I don't see this one. Just judging by their social media posts and from the short doco of their Europe tour with HSB, it looks like they've still got so much energy. Winston is always so hyped and positive and they're working on a new album which will be huge. They're already pretty massive but their last European tour really solidified that. I know he's doing community based things in Byron Bay at the moment but I can't see Parkway calling it any time soon.
p12685
aVPretty sure thats not happening anytime soon
p12686
aVBecause you know more about them than him, right? 
p12687
aVi'd hate to see parkway go. they're so talented imo
p12688
aVNo, it just doesn't seem like they are going to quit, judging by their instagram/twitter posts and how they are doing live.
p12689
aVOf Mice &amp; Men, hopefully. 
p12690
aVNah, they're just now starting to really cash in.
p12691
aVI know...I just want to see them go out with dignity. \u000a\u000aIt probably won't happen. 
p12692
aVThey've lost any and all dignity by this point.
p12693
aVAs metallica said,"Sold out?Yea we sold out....a million."
p12694
aVAll those lives they have saved and they couldn't save their own.
p12695
aVDAE h8 restore force?
p12696
aVI wasn't big on The Flood either. 
p12697
aVOne can only dream. 
p12698
aVEscape The Fate and/or Asking Alexandria as far as metalcore goes.
p12699
aVI know no one wants to hear it, including myself.. but im thinking August Burns Red 
p12700
aVReally? \u000aThey signed to Fearless and are releasing a new album soon, they've had a really solid lineup as well.\u000aMaybe a hiatus, but not calling it quits :/
p12701
aVYeah, signing a multi-album contract with a new label isn't really how you go about calling it quits.
p12702
aVFrom what JB has been saying recently, I think that's pretty unlikely\u000a\u000aEdit: It seems like they're slowing down a bit on the touring, since most of them are married now, and Brent has a kid, but I don't think they'll stop playing music any time soon
p12703
aVI chilled with them after their set on Frozen Flame Tour for an hour or two and tbh I think /u/dougcourt is right, I'd rather not say exactly why but he's onto something.
p12704
aVlets just say i have heard somethings as well. much before this thread decided to pop up.
p12705
aVDamn, that's not a good sign
p12706
aVI really don't think so. What makes you think that?\u000a
p12707
aVIm simply going off of how long the band has been together, + where they are in their life. They have families now, they have other careers. They are honrstly one of my favorite metal core banded but that's no reason to NOT be realistic about what bands are coming to an end. 
p12708
aVthey said in an interview I red that they have no plans on slowing down
p12709
aV[deleted]
p12710
aVJake was in the AMA, he just didn't answer as many questions, and Matt answered questions the next day, since he was busy at the time. Also, at least from my experience from meeting them at the Frozen Flame tour last month and what they've been posting on social media, they all seem to be getting along pretty well at the moment
p12711
aVLooks like Veil of Maya, After the Burial, and Invent Animate are touring together and this is a double date.  \u000a  \u000ahttp://lambgoat.com/news/24069/The-Ghost-Inside-The-Acacia-Strain-Gideon-tour

aVOh damn, right link in the context of the right thread, haha. My bad.
p12714
aVI'm really interested in that link for ATB, can you hook a brother up
p12715
aVBring Me The Horizon. They will put out a new album and then BAM! out of nowhere they will call it quits. Oli will focus on his clothing line more becoming more of an entrepreneur, or maybe work on some other music projects that are a completely different genre of music. The other band members will try to start up different projects of their own or just call it quits with their music careers and settle down.
p12716
aVthis doesn't make any sense, they're doing better than ever and seem to be happy where they are.
p12717
aVMatt Nichols looks like he's going to fall asleep playing drums now. I think he's going be leaving soon.
p12718
aVThe money will keep him awake for awhile.
p12719
aVnahh
p12720
aVit's all hypothetical
p12721
aVAnd if they don't they'r going to lose the fan base they have, if their next album sounds like drown they're going to lose a lot of the people that didn't like drown. They've gotten really soft especially when you compare drown deathbeds and a bunch of their newer softer stuff to pray for plagues and suicide season 
p12722
aVI think they've gained more fans than lost fans by ditching their deathcore sound and for the better. As much as I like their old stuff, I just associate it with them being immature, angry, and drugged out teens. Its nice to see them happy with their new music and in a good place in their lives.

aVYep. They worked with the same producer too haha.
p12790
aVMinus dem sweeps 
p12791
aVYeah, both bands use those really "spooky"/atmospheric sounding leads quite a bit though.
p12792
aVErra is a bit more djenty/progressive, but they have a somewhat similar sound, here's [Dreamcatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2a0firXFc)\u000a\u000aEdit: Also, Fit For a King is Christian, but they're a lot less preachy, at least in most songs, and they have a very similar sound
p12793
aVTo add, Erra is only similar to their first 3 albums. Immortal and after are too chug chug to be similar to Erra. Very accurate on FFAK though. 
p12794
aVYeah, that's sort of what I meant, I just didn't feel like explaining that in the original comment
p12795
aVDepends on what type of For Today you like, since their original stuff is way different than their new stuff.\u000a\u000aFor old: Within The Ruins and After The Burial\u000a\u000aFor new: Texas In July (the album Bloodwork especially) and The Ghost Inside
p12796
aVEven though TIJ is a lot less preachy, I think they're still Christian, just so you know
p12797
aVYea I guess you're right, they don't really show it too much in their music though.
p12798
aVFair enough, definitely makes sense to recommend them
p12799
aVnah tij isn't a christian band anymore
p12800
aVI'm pretty sure at least some of the members are still Christian, not that it really matters though
p12801
aVyeah of course, i just know that they don't label themselves as a christian band anymore is what i meant.
p12802
aVAh, makes sense
p12803
aVI think it has to do with JT becoming their new vocalist or whatever since their original vocalist wrote lyrics with christian themes.
p12804
aVThat definitely makes sense then
p12805
aVUpon a Burning Body is fairly similar. Danny and Mattie's vocals are very close.\u000a\u000aEdit: Their song [Intermission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWGVh4TUaes)
p12806
aVWell there's Architects, but they're basically the opposite of For Today lyric wise...
p12807
aVThat's what he's asking...
p12808
aVI'm aware... But they bash Christians pretty hard too. Not exactly sure if he's into that either
p12809
aVThey don't really bash Christians, they just have lyrics that reflect how they don't believe in it, and don't like it when people use it for bad reasons

aVno they don't...

aVWhy does it matter if a band is Christian? Im genuinely curious. I just never understood why that matters. I would consider myself Christian and I absolutely love for today and my favorite band of all time is haste the day, but one of my favorite bands right now is thy art is murder. I also love within the ruins, the acacia strain, etc. 
p12814
aVHonestly, there isn't a solid reason. The lyrics of a song seriously alter whether I like it or not. I don't always agree with Christian lyrics, being as I don't believe in god, so it influences my preference on whether I like it.

(lp12819
VOn my date of the Frozen Flame tour when he did that, everyone in the crowd was kinda just all, standing slack jawed. 
p12820
aVI saw them in Denver. Man, what a fun show.
p12821
aVI timed it, and he held it for 20 seconds...
p12822
aVEven more impressive when you consider the fact that he has asthma.
p12823
aVAnd it is a live show. Doing this in the studio is hard, doing it in a live show seems impossible.
p12824
aVI always thought the studio version was just some sort of vocal effect. Maybe it was, but it doesn't matter because he backs it up live!
p12825
aVsome not all are several vocal takes stitched together to get the desired effect
p12826
aVThe studio version is a real scream that kind of shifts into a sample of static. 
p12827
aVAhh that makes sense.
p12828
aVI equate this to when you're watching a movie and when the protagonist goes underwater you hold your breath as well, just to see if it's possible. I got like 10 seconds in and just noped on out of there.
p12829
aVFuck me. That was at least twice as long as I expected.
p12830
aVI'm on tour with him and he said the other day that when he tracked it in the studio, he did the full scream for the length of the breakdown. so he finishes the scream, all red faced and out of breath, and the producer says "okay that was a good one, let's get one more and double it so it sounds stronger"\u000a\u000aso he does the full scream again, eyes closed, straining through it and almost passes out. he finishes the scream and looks up at the producer and everyone in the other room is laughing really hard. it turns out they didn't need a second scream. they just wanted to see him struggle to get a second one out. thought it was pretty funny. \u000a\u000ahe is a phenomenal vocalist. he nails that scream every single night on tour. 
p12831
aVThat was impressive. Even more impressive is at the end he just belts out even stronger when you're thinking "holy shit when is this guy going to take a breath?"
p12832
aVSome vocalists just do what they can to keep getting the note out. When Casey Crescenzo did an AMA on /r/posthardcore he was asked about the really long note in [this video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQvcGK0MWJM&amp;t=207), and he basically said that he almost blacked out from it. I'll go find his reply now. [Here it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostHardcore/comments/2u3zdc/im_casey_crescenzo_from_the_dear_hunter_and_the/co509e8)\u000a\u000a

VOne important thing is to make sure the vocals are loud enough that the vocalist doesn't have to strain to be heard over everything, since that's a really good way to blow out your voice
p12856
aVSimplest way is trusting your ears, if you have an EQ that allows you to adjust both the level and the frequency then turn the level all the way up and sweep the frequencies until you find the area that sounds the worst, then turn down the level to the negative side. Sort of a cheap trick but works pretty well especially when youre getting started. Cut more than you boost. Chill with the bass.

VI personally loved ROTL, though it doesn't hold a candle to Monument. I'd like to see more of a mix between ROTL and Monument on future releases. Find that balance between melodic choruses and heavy verses.
p12865
aVYou described how I feel about them exactly\u000a\u000aEdit: Though I'd be even happier if they added more variety to the songs, and didn't just follow the verse/chorus/verse/chorus format so much
p12866
aVLevi's vocals need more production than last album.  I hate encouraging this, but they do.\u000a\u000aRyan's vocals need to be less compressed.  They felt very unemotional. 
p12867
aVI kind of liked Ryan's vocals. It's what separates him from others I think. He kinda has a Volbeat style.
p12868
aVThe album sounded fine to me, they just needed better guitarwork. 
p12869
aVI just think the production value/quality on ROTL was pitiful. It all sounded trashy and over compressed. They need that full, dark, rich tone that Monument/At Heart had. Just play the albums side by side. Monument feels like it is taking up all the space in your ears, so does At Heart; while ROTL sounds so flat and amatuer. Songwriting wise...ROTL isn't atrocious musically. The riffs are cool, but the lyrics just sorta make me cringe. I get what they tried to do with them, but it didn't work. If they go back to that full sound, and better lyrical content...I think they'll be fine. I like At Heart for the most part, and I don't mind Levi's new screams. In fact, "Hey Mister" is my favorite MMI song, but I think production and lyrical content really let them down this last album.

aVStraight up if Levi can't sound better, they would need to get someone else. This obviously won't happen though.

p12885
aVI don't know how to link on Spotify but all of these are on there. I don't really know what to suggest as I wouldn't say I listen to many "smaller" bands, but I'll give you my recently most played.  \u000aFeed Her To The Sharks - Fortitude, just got put on there and it's sick.  \u000aAffiance - Blackout, normally don't like clean vocals much at all but he's sick.  \u000aHeaven Shall Burn - VETO, not strictly metalcore more melo-deathy but cool as fuck.  \u000aNe Obliviscaris - Citadel, I can't stand progressive metal, but these guys are a progressive death metal outfit that absolutely kill the genre, amazing instruments and songs that feel like stories.  \u000aHundredth - When Will We Surrender, classic core shit.  \u000aJamie's Elsewhere - Rebel-Revive, sort of soft metalcore kind of stuff, I like it a fair bit.  \u000aA Plea For Purging - The Marriage Of Heaven And Hell, basic deathcore stuff, the album art is what got me.   \u000a  \u000aLet me know if you listen to/ like any of it.\u000a
p12886
aVI've always meant to look up Feed Her To The Sharks and Hundreth but never did, so I'll be sure to check that out. I'll probably check out the others as well (other than Jamie's Elsewhere, I've listened to them for a while now) but I'll start there. Thanks. 
p12887
aVWell I always listen to a shit ton of music so here goes:\u000a\u000aBefore anything, look up One Year Later. Great dudes from Lancaster, PA who put out an insane record in 2014 and just put out a video for their best song, Real Ghost.\u000a\u000aI'm currently jamming a lot of old Escape the Fate because I'm pretty hyped for the new Falling In Reverse record. \u000a\u000aJust got to see Sleeping With Sirens and Pierce the Veil for free the other day and my attention was really caught by the British rockers Mallory Knox who opened the show. Great alt. rock stuff with a post-hardcore-ish flair. Two really solid albums from those dudes. \u000a\u000aNew Enter Shikari album is really badass.\u000a\u000aNew Periphery double album is even more badass. Thats the only thing I've had in my truck since its release. \u000a\u000aKingdom of Giants is another underrated metalcore band. Check out the song Sky Burial and have your socks rocked off.\u000a\u000aStart with that!
p12888
aVOne Year Later is pretty sweet. Really liking Real Ghost and Dead Inside.
p12889
aVPeriphery's Juggernaut is dope, but I haven't listened to much of the others. Thanks
p12890
aVDitto on Periphery. It's just *perfect*
p12891
aVAbandoned By Bears, City Lights, Dance Gavin Dance, These Hearts and Tiny Moving Parts lately.
p12892
aVI've been listening to a lethal amount of One Year Later and Currents as far as metalcore goes, but lots of Skull Kid, Flowers Taped To Pens, Grey Gordon, Balance And Composure, Xerxes, Fistbenders, Roanoke, Things Fall Apart, Dance Gavin Dance, Circle Takes The Square, Code Orange, Every Time I Die, Chase Huglin, Rookie Town, Light Black, Of Us Giants and stuff otherwise.

aVI burn through albums like crazy, since I listen to music at work 30+ hours a week and when I study with 18 credits.  I have listened through all of these albums countless times and they have been great study music for me. I started digging through most of these pretty recently. Best of luck man!\u000a\u000a[Stolas - Allomaternal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrzrHhmOSW4): Clean vocalist sounds a bit weird at times, but it has some really epic moments. Proving Grounds and Solunar are my favorite tracks so far. Been listening to this album on repeat the past few days.\u000a\u000a[Hail The Sun - Wake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i45pYq-58po): Their clean and unclean vocalist is their drummer and he is an amazing drummer in his own right. I listened to this album like 50 times in a few days last week, so it holds for me.\u000a\u000a[Narco Debut - Self Titled](https://narcodebut.bandcamp.com/album/narco-debut): Local band from Detroit that's insanely good. Not very angry, but amazing nonetheless. No offense to -core music, but these guys write something that feels like actual real music with melodies and stuff. Really good.\u000a\u000a[Periphery - Alpha/Omega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDDZyf3qzVw&amp;list=PLH22-xSMERQp9Jq_FLpgQ57BHZEm132Nz): It's an amazing experience to listen to these back to back. Look me about ten playthroughs to learn to enjoy fully because it can kind of be a mess of shit at first.\u000a\u000a[Enter Shikari - The Mindsweep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHSHhs3ynSo&amp;list=PLKAm0swRNcks6uvDF2MdqO9NIuXP0uy5_): Environmentalcore. For real, a very creative album, I love it and respect Enter Shikari so much.\u000a\u000a[From Indian Lakes - Able Bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-H6l511ofU&amp;list=PLpdMiFSvzwgmeqeb7yBVKUMhRF-cjq-lJ): Not angry at all, but an absolutely amazing band. Seriously, if anyone is reading this, take the time to listen to this album. If it's not for you, that's fine, but everyone I've played this album to has fallen in love with it. These guys are absolutely phenomenal. They have a dedicated tambourinist and organist to add to the atmosphere.

aVYeah, Severed Ties is dope, but it took me a while to get around to it. 
p12946
aVsuch a great album
p12947
aVthey got inspirational and stopped trying to actually write their songs
p12948
aVTheir earlier stuff saved my life.\u000a\u000aBut really, listen to "stairway to hell", gr8 song.\u000a
p12949
aVTo be fair, I think a lot of hate towards Capture The Crown was more due to their attitude issues on top of being generic as fuck. I don't think you can generate that much hate by being just generic. 
p12950
aVWhat do you mean "attitude", you filthy fucking cunt?
p12951
aVYes.

p12954
aV[deleted]
p12955
aVNot necessarily the band itself, but I've seen people absolutely SHIT on Structures' Life Through A Window, which I thought was a fucking solid record.
p12956
aVrip :(
p12957
aVI get so angry every time I read the comments on their YouTube videos
p12958
aVI personally prefer it to Divided By, it doesn't have the whiny cleans and there's actual well written songs being played, guess some people like the chaos more.
p12959
aVSworn In. Tyler might be a kind of a tool still thinking he's an emo kid in high school, but the band itself isn't that bad. 
p12960
aVThe actual music is fantastic imo, it's just the lyrics that kill you it for me. 
p12961
aVI actually like death cards lyrics maybe im the only one
p12962
aVThey're great if you're fucking pissed
p12963
aVI don't think TDC's lyrics are *too* bad. I feel like he can write great lyrics if he wanted to. Catharsis on the other hand is horrible. 
p12964
aVBlack Veil Brides. \u000a\u000aTheir first album isn't amazing or anything, in fact it's just ok, but it's way better than people give it credit for. They don't deserve to be put in the ranks of Blood on the Dancefloor or Brokencyde. 
p12965
aVI don't listen to BvB really but honestly they were the first band to get me into metalcore, so I owe it to them at least.  They have a couple of catchy songs.
p12966
aV&gt;They have a couple of catchy songs.\u000a\u000aKnives and Pens, Perfect Weapon, Children Surrender, and Heaven's Calling are pretty good. 
p12967
aVAgreed. I don't like them, but at least their guitarists actually know what they're doing. As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather listen to songs with actual leads and solos than incessant breakdowns and four chord choruses. You can say what you want about them, but their instrumentalists are objectively more talented than a lot of big names in the scene, like Memphis May Fire, Asking Alexandria, A Day to Remember, Of Mice and Men, etc. I will agree that Andy Biersack is a total douche, and can't sing for shit, though.
p12968
aV&gt; As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather listen to songs with actual leads and solos than incessant breakdowns and four chord choruses. \u000a\u000aGive me a good riff and a catchy chorus and I'm good. But I would definitely take them over half the shit out there. There's plenty of stuff that's way better though. So it's not something I'll be listening to often. Not when I've got Killswitch, Haste the Day, Darkest Hour, Johnny Truant, The Agony Scene, Still Remains, Shadows Fall, As I Lay Dying, The Human Abstract, Becoming the Archetype, Demon Hunter, Living Sacrifice, Between the Buried and Me, Parkway Drive, The Showdown, The Sorrow, War of Ages, Destroy the Runner, Avenged Sevenfold, Sacred Mother Tongue, and surely plenty more. 
p12969
aVThe majority of the bands you listed are kick ass! You're right, BVB are nothing special that I would willingly listen to, but it's hard to lump them with BOTDF and SWS when they have more talent than the majority of the genericore bands in the scene 
p12970
aV&gt;BVB are nothing special that I would willingly listen to, but it's hard to lump them with BOTDF and SWS\u000a\u000aI don't think you're giving SWS enough credit either. They're nothing special themselves, but they aren't painful to listen to like Blood on the Dancefloor. 
p12971
aVI just can't help but see their 'band look' and want to vomit. 
p12972
aVYeah. It's kind of cringy. But to be fair, you'd probably be saying that about KISS if you were around in their day.\u000a\u000aOr maybe you feel that way about KISS now. 
p12973
aVI do feel a bit like that about KISS, but they had the benefit of at least being original. It probably was provocative and mysterious at the time, but you just cant blatantly rip off the look 40 years after it was cool IMO. \u000a
p12974
aVI will also admit I'm a bit idealistic when it comes to bands, for example I can't listen to As I Lay Dying without thinking 'this is great but the singer tried to kill his wife...' and feeling like it spoils the effect a bit. \u000a\u000aOn the other hand, when I discovered Trivium and realised I liked everything about them, from their look to their style to their personalities, I was in love.
p12975
aVI'm quite the opposite. Short of the band personally dong something awful to me or my family, nothing would keep me from listening to them if I liked the music. \u000a\u000aI don't care what they look like, act like, or believe.
p12976
aV&gt;I do feel a bit like that about KISS, but they had the benefit of at least being original.\u000a\u000aAs stupid as I think the look is, you're right. They at least were original. And were shocking back then. It just looks silly now though. 
p12977
aVTo be fair: A phrase that often precedes a statement that is intended to offer a piece of information which the speaker feels is important to the conversation. This phrase often sounds pretentious when used, and will often be followed by a piece of obvious information that nobody wants to hear.
p12978
aVTo be fair, I didn't know this. 
p12979
aVBrokencyde at least did something different. BVB has some cringeworthy generic moments mixed with just plain awful vocals.
p12980
aV&gt;Brokencyde at least did something different.\u000a\u000aSo did Design the Skyline. Different =/= good. \u000a\u000a &gt; BVB has some cringeworthy generic moments mixed with just plain awful vocals.\u000a\u000aTheir vocals aren't that awful. They're a million times better than Blood on the Dancefloor. I'm not saying they're a top tier band by any means. But they're easily a tier or two above horrid crunkcore. 
p12981
aVYou can't give brokenCYDE praise and hate on BVB, Wut. 
p12982
aVWell, Brokencyde had [one song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbg6lwq5yS4) I actually liked. Can't say the same about BVB lol\u000a\u000a\u000aBut yeah they are a few steps above Brokencyde musically, but I personally think they kinda deserve the hate they get.
p12983
aVBVB has one song that I actually really enjoyed, I still get chills every time I listen to it, [In the End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWsJAsQ-RwA) the music video is pretty cringy so I'm just going to send the lyric video.
p12984
aVI agree with this. In The End is a pretty fuck ing good song, but the rest is very meh. Not bad, just meh.
p12985
aVdude you have to be trolling by claiming that song to be more enjoyable than BVB's entire body of work
p12986
aVTo be fair I'd much rather listen to Brokencyde than BVB anyday. At least I can get a laugh out of Brokencyde and it's somewhat musically interesting. 
p12987
aVI'm with ya man. For as much as I hate "crunk poser metal white boy gangstacore" I hate hair metal more. 
p12988
aVOmam. They can't make the same album over abd over.
p12989
aVBut they CAN make better music, which is what they are neglecting to do.
p12990
aVIn your opinion 
p12991
aVIt's a widespread opinion.
p12992
aVI don't see it a whole lot in this thread, but ETF.\u000a\u000aTheir latest album is definitely better than anything else they've done (Craig-era)
p12993
aVFor me it's Motionless In White, yeah they're dressing all dark and spooky, no they don't sound exactly like Manson, \u000aIssues, Tyler Carter has a great voice, while Michael Bonn's isn't exceptional, it's still quite strong, they're doing something new and making fun songs.
p12994
aVVerb The Noun\u000a
p12995
aVFuck Verb The Noun, bet they got signed before even having a band practice.
p12996
aVOf Mice &amp; Men. Sure, they've changed their sound. From a metalcore perspective, they've changed for the worse. But they're on the verge of a mainstream breakthrough. They've toured with Linkin Park for crying out loud. \u000a\u000aAt the end of the day, music is a business and these guys are in it to make money. I can never fault them for "selling out". Who would you rather be - a talented, yet relatively unknown and poor band (Oh, Sleeper, Erra, Breakdown of Sanity, etc.) or a sellout making a comfortable living? I'm taking option B. 
p12997
aVI see what you are saying and agree with you to an extent, but when you begin to make music for the sole sake of selling records just to make money because that's what is popular it's no longer an art form. It's simply a path to a pay check. 
p12998
aVMaybe, just maybe, they got bored playing open string breakdowns and wanted to play ThreeDaysGracecore. Anyway I think they are still playing music they like.
p12999

aVDAE le epic life saved joke
p13001
aVI think when a band gets extremely shitty sounding, they deserve the hate they receive. Even if they're getting a lot of money for being shitty sounding.
p13002
aVThat's totally subjective. Therefor every band ever is totally deserving of hate because someone thinks they sound like shit.
p13003
aVYa I agree with that.
p13004
aVI agree with Of Mice &amp; Men but IMO it's just that they're not that much worse than they used to be. To me Restoring Force doesn't seem to be very far off The Flood musically; they're both OK but nothing special.
p13005
aVIt's several miles off the flood.
p13006
aVyeah, I don't get why people think that. the distance between RF and The Flood is tiny compared to the distance between The Flood and a really good metalcore album
p13007
aVNah man, what I was meaning to say was that RF was straight shit with like 3 good songs. The flood didn't have a bad song on it, in fact I consider it to be OM&amp;Ms best album. 
p13008
aVEmmure: The 0000 jokes are old, not funny and most of the time wrong, stop it. They have their own sound, and Speaker of the Dead, despite it's faults (aliens and fellatio watching), is a metalcore/deathcore landmark.\u000a\u000a\u000aLimp Bizkit: They did something different and super fun back then and made rock mainstream again. Can't wait for the new album, Ready to Go was a good jam (if you exclude that Lil Wayne part).\u000a\u000a\u000aBMTH: I mean c'mon, people are still mad that Oli gets a lot of fangirls? pffft\u000a\u000a\u000aBlack Tongue: Yes there's a lot of breakdowns, yes they tune their guitars and bass really low and yes they play slow. That's how they want to sound, no one really played that kind of slowed pace/doomy deathcore so well before.\u000a\u000a
p13009
aV&gt;  They did something different and super fun back then and made rock mainstream again. Can't wait for the new album, Ready to Go was a good jam\u000a\u000athis is breathtakingly wrong. Rock was mainstream when limp bizkit were big. They also didn't do anything different, just took Deftones and made it more marketable\u000a\u000aand WHO HATES ON BLACK TONGUE LIKE F'REAL
p13010
aV[Black Tongue hate](http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/62255/Black-Tongue-Born-Hanged/), I could show you more reviews, youtube comments and etc, but you get the point.\u000a\u000aAbout LB, I still disagree, opinions I guess. 
p13011
aVwhat, that rock was mainstream or that they "made something new and fun"?
p13012
aVThat they made [something new and fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTMVOzPPtiw). I was to busy watching pokemon back in 1998/99 to pay attention if rock was really mainstream.  
p13013
aV1) I'm shocked people hate Black Tongue and then go on to like Attila and Emmure\u000a\u000a2) Again, they took what Deftones were doing and made it more sellable. I'm not sure if that makes it 'new' 
p13014
aVI don't "hate" on them, but I did see them live and was bored as fuck, and I enjoy a lot of deathcore.
p13015
aVAgree with you pretty much everywhere, even though I'm not super into Black Tongue people get waaaay too annoyed about them.
p13016
aVPeople hate on Black Tongue?! Where?! These people need some serious adjustments.\u000a
p13017
aV&gt;People hate on Black Tongue?! Where?! These people need some serious adjustments.\u000a\u000aDoes not liking them equal hating them? 
p13018
aVNo I imagine not liking is acknowledging they exist within the medium and not enjoying their music. Hating would be gong as far to bash the band and have a stronger anger towards them.
p13019
aV&gt;No I imagine not liking is acknowledging they exist within the medium and not enjoying their music. Hating would be gong as far to bash the band and have a stronger anger towards them.\u000a\u000aI can think of a few deathcore bands i feel that way about, but Black Tongue  isn't one of them. Even among the tune it low play it slow stuff. If I was forced to listen to that style of music, I might listen to them. 
p13020
aVBlack Tongue is the only slow chugga chugga choo choo bands I listen to. After a while it can get cumbersome. I prefer the fast weedley dees of Rings of Saturn.
p13021
aVWatching you guys try and create a term for "downtempo" is entertaining, thank you haha
p13022
aVRoS is sweet, one of the few deathcore bands that really amazes me. I go for [Carnifex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHTAj8wirsM), [Thy Art is Murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM_tlE6uO4) and [HIroshima Will Burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keKJ0IwnND8) as well. 
p13023
aV&lt;3 TAIM. Carnifex is dope. first time I have heard of HWB and I am only a minute in and I'm really digging it.
p13024
aV&gt; first time I have heard of HWB and I am only a minute in and I'm really digging it.\u000a\u000aProbably because they only released one album and broke up. Which is a shame. They were basically RoS without the aliens. 
p13025
aVAttila because people are too stupid to realize it's a joke.\u000a\u000aAsking Alexandria too
p13026
aVJoke =/= good music. And I don't really like Fronz's 14 yo humor either. He was cool back in the Rage days and probably IRL, but over the Internet/new albums I can't stand how pretentious he is.

aVExcept he actually a really chill and mellow guy. I've met him twice and he is far from pretentious.
p13028

aVThis is my favorite song by them and it probably is one of their least listened to songs.\u000a\u000aThe slow to fast transitions and melodic keys are awesome.  Dusty was a beast.  \u000a\u000aAlways wanted to know what is being said backwards from 2:57 to 3:16.  \u000a

aVSeriously, they want to make fucking money. There's nothing more to it. They know their...er...rabid fanbase will buy it, so why wouldn't they make it?
p13048
aVRise is in the business of cushioning their pockets. They are notorious for pushing  re-issues and acoustic/remix bonus material - especially if that certain band has increased their popularity. That is the case here, again.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe hidden genius behind this nonsense is that it's keeping bands focused and relevant in between album cycles and on tour. A necessary evil, in my opinion.

aVReally? Hm. I would think out of all the band members he would be the most gung-ho about an EP like that. 
p13052
aVMoney. 
p13053
aVA more serious answer than money, they want to maintain their name, they want to make people remember who they are and not get bored listening to their music. Its why any band puts a deluxe version of their album out.\u000aand also money 
p13054
aVBut mostly money.
p13055
aVAnother possible reason (and I don't know enough about OMAM or Rise's contracts to know if they have this built in or not, so here's to speculation) is that it can take up another album on your contract. When you sign a contract with a label typically you sign for x amount of albums. Remember all that hoopla with ADTR and Victory? It was because ADTR thought that their re-release of "Homesick" counted as a record toward their contract. Some bands are perfectly fine with putting out a "Deluxe Edition" because it fills up their contract faster. That way they can get either a better deal, move on to a new label, ect. Again, I don't know enough about OMAM's contract or how Rise does business but that could be the case. This is the one time I'll stand up for OMAM and say they might not be doing a cash grab haha

aVIt's all good, I completely agree
p13066
aVIt's a shame Lee has obviously struggled to record this, because you can audibly hear at 0:50-59 that fast guitar playing is very heavily quantised 
p13067
aVI got a major Animals As Leaders vibe from this. Not sure yet whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.
p13068
aVTo me at least it sounds like a less interesting version of Animals as Leaders, not terrible though
p13069
aVI honestly thought it was better than the majority of the songs from TWDA, but still isn't as good as Jason's single he put out. 
p13070
aVIn terms of interesting guitar stuff, definitely, but as far as the songs overall, I actually really liked TWDA
p13071
aVFor me I can listen to just one song and like it a lot, but if I listen to all they all sound the same. That just really bothers me on this album, plus the lack of lead guitar and a lot of 00000's.
p13072
aVI definitely agree on that last bit, I like the vocals a lot more on it than their previous albums though, and as a vocalist, I tend to focus most on the vocals\u000a\u000aEdit: Also, while I'm usually not a fan of electronic stuff, I really liked a lot of the synth parts on TWDA

Just because you don't see us talking or posting about newer bands doesn't mean we don't do it. But you're not wrong about this subreddit jerking the same bands constantly.

p13096
aVYou're obviously not looking hard enough, mate. I've found the majority of my current metalcore favorites through this sub: a lot of them being younger, up-and-coming bands that will probably be prominent in the genre in a few years.

aVI agree with you. I try to listen to several bands posted that I have never heard of each night. If I like them the I will upvote and check out their other stuff. It's a very simple and painless process, but if more people did something like it then more people's horizons would be broadened and more bands would get the recognition that they deserve.
p13099
aVI disagree for a number of reasons. 1. I've came across tons of bands due to this subreddit I wouldn't have ever heard of Sirens and Sailors or Gwen Stacy if it wasn't for this subreddit. 2. Popular Bands staying popular won't kill a genre rap didn't die because people kept recommending Dr. Dre and Easy E. Popular Artist staying good and having support will make them noticed and have people looking for more.

aVDude, there are about 20 "Here's My Band/My Friend's Band" posts on the front page every week. Some days there will be 8 or 9 in a day. So you can't honestly say that we as a community don't give love to new bands. It sounds like you just don't lurk often enough.

aVAvoid names with a generic format, like "verb the noun", "I, the noun", "___ of the ____". I think you guys did good with the name Sirens &amp; Sailors. It's simple, easy to remember, and has a cool meaning behind it. Ultimately it comes down to whether or not the music you make is good and not the name (which I'm sure you'll have no problem with).\u000a\u000aIf you don't mind me asking, whats your new EP going to be like?

aVI am a big fan of monepic band names, that is, bands like Emmure, Adestria, Alesana and Periphery. The multiple syllables gives it definition but it's not too long so it's not a mouth full e.g. Fear Before The March of Flames, And You will Know Us By The Trail Of Blood. I feel a solid 5-6 syllables is the maximum amount and band name should be. SI-RENS AND SAIL-ORS, MY CHIL-DREN MY BRIDE, THE DE-VIL WEARS PRA-DA, you get the point.\u000a\u000aObviously the whole Verb the Noun has been run into the ground be now and should be avoided. There are good ones out there, but again it's just over played.\u000a\u000aTacky and flashy names always just rub me the wrong way, too, like Lions!TigersBears!, Feed Her To The Sharks, A Bullet For a Pretty Boy, Shreddy Kruger.\u000a\u000aThe title should really try to reflect the music the band produces as well, I think deathcore bands do this the best like Thy Art Is Murder, Rings of Saturn and Suicide Silence
p13143
aV1. Ampersands\u000a\u000a2. Commas\u000a\u000a3. Exclamation points\u000a\u000a4. The letter I\u000a\u000aYou can use my band name--I, The Ampersand! (I,T&amp;!) if you'd like.\u000a\u000aJk, I tend to like band names that reference books--As I Lay Dying,  The Devil Wears Prada, Ice Nine Kills, etc. So find a cool book and find a cool reference from it.
p13144
aVI'm gonna call my band Of Mice and Men
p13145
aVI think there's hardly any good names, make sure to stay away from verb the noun or an adjective then a noun. I think one word names are pretty awesome, but it needs to stand out or a few words that have flow/saying.\u000a\u000aI've got the same problem as you haha

They all just sound badass 
p13148
aVI'll probably get flammed for this, but I think Suicide Silence is a terrible band, like imagine saying you like that to someone or at a music store and you mention that, it just gives off such a scene vibe. It's for like everything that has a death related topic in the title, when I asked about Every Time I Die if they had any of their stuff, and I just felt like they thought I listened to terrible music.
p13149
aVHey to each their own! Personally I love saying Suicide Silence because of those looks but I completely get where you are coming from! 
p13150
aVI'm glad you didn't take it badly its just my personality and that's your personality like I guess I'm just a more reserved dude quite often
p13151
aVI'd like to change my answer, you should call it "The Ball's in Your Court"
p13152
aVVerb the Noun
p13153
aVUniqueness is key, no generic verb the noun formats. Not more than 5-6 syllables, even that is pushing it. One word names are a safe bet as long as, again, they're unique. Not generic sounding stuff like horizons, visions, voices, perception, issues. Think more along the lines of underoath, oh sleeper, oceans ate alaska, breakdown of sanity, glass cloud, crossfaith, northlane, and ice nine kills. They all easily roll off the tongue, and they're unique enough that the the name stands out and sticks with you. Bonus points if it actually has some kind of deeper meaning, or at least seems like it does.
p13154
aVI agree with band name needing to be unique. I will also add make sure no other band is using that name already (check google/last fm to see if bands names not already taken) if so then it's not yours to use. Nothing worse than trying to Check out a particular bands music online/spotify only to have to go though music of multiple bands at the same time. 
p13155
aVAll the bands I like have admitted that they hate their names haha, well at least a few of my favorites.

p13158
aVJust one word. 
p13159
aV[deleted]
p13160
aVI think that a band name has to mean something to you and your bandmates, even if it makes no sense to others. Even outside the 'core bubble, people do that, and it works. I'm trying to start a group myself, and I'm trying to go off that philosophy.
p13161
aV[deleted]
p13162
aVI guess the best thing you can aim for is originality, to am extent of course! After that part, which helps you get noticed, is a story behind it that you can tell to fans or whoever doesn't agree with your name for it. \u000aHave you ever heard of how Led Zeppelin was named? If you haven't look it up! You would never doubt the name and nor would others

p13184
aVI don't know what but I kinda had a feeling it was Jonathan Vigil when they said they had a special guest to feature on the track.
p13185
aVI actually like the cleans waaay better on the original Skydancer and I like Jake singing the Vigil verse better. Maybe I'm just stupidly against change or something, but when I buy this album I'll be making a playlist with the old Skydancer in place of the new one.

p13188
aVwhy are you being downvoted for giving the right answer? this sub really fucking sucks
p13189
aVThere's an EP called Into The Storm from 2007 and a 2008 full length called The Gateway. I only know Divination and Earthwalker so I'm guessing it's off one of those two. 
p13190
aVIt's not, it was a single released in 2013 and the proceeds went to indigenous communities (skydancer project)

aVWhat happened with Northlane last week? 
p13193
aVSomeone posted about the booklets found in both Northlane's and In Hearts Wake's most recent albums and somehow there were hints at a Northlane/In Hearts Wake collab. The producer of Earthwalker (uses  reddit and is in this thread now just too lazy to tag him to this comment) has been hinting at it as well. However, after posting that comment I re-listened to Skywalker and noticed that the ending sounds like its leading up to another song. So who knows really hahaha

p13232
aVDon't you find the cleans to lower the intensity? Just in the context of being filthy and aggressive 
p13233
aVNot really, at least in my opinion they make a really good buildup to the heavy parts, usually I'd agree with you, but I feel like Fit For a King does a really good job at using them in the right places
p13234
aVI admit the cleans didn't take away too much, well I agree it is heavy especially in the terms of normal structure but songs that don't have Chorus or structure I find are the heaviest and most aggressive, like My world by Code Orange\u000a\u000aYou may disagree and that's perfectly fine
p13235
aVI definitely agree usually, ABR is my favorite band and they don't have cleans or a structure, and that helps make them so interesting to me, I just feel like Fit For a King does a pretty good job at using cleans well
p13236
aVThe last track on Creation/Destruction is a chug fest but it has no cleans and it is out right hateful

aVKillswitch. 
p13279
aVAgreed. Some of their stuff is a little weak for my tastes, but they always look like they're having a blast.
p13280
aVFor me they strike the right balance between "heavy" and catchy. A perfect example would be [Self Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNhIw6Soa_4), [You Don't Bleed for Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE-B_naKelI), or [Reject Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9WGpbDp9U) and I haven't heard much do that. Into Eternity do it well, and AILD are obvious. The Agonist do it well on their single [Gates of Horn and Ivory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urcLhku0I7Y). 
p13281
aVAw man I forgot about Into Eternity! Every Time I Die is another band that I love, but I don't really know where they fit in. I want to say they come from a more punk/hardcore influenced background than someone like Unearth who is kind of my reference point for the metalcore genre.
p13282
aVFeel free to post/comment every time I die they are metalcore/mathcore
p13283
aVETID is amazing. The few albums I've listened to anyway. 
p13284
aVEveryone loves Hot Damn. I first saw them in a shitty club in Iowa City while they were promoting it and Keith monkey barred around in the rafters. I was either a sophomore or a junior in high school and I've been hooked ever since.
p13285
aVI'll have to give it a listen when I finish this album. The ETID I've heard is their newer, southern stuff. The Big Dirty, Gutter Phenomenon, New Junk Aesthetic, From Parts Unknown.  
p13286
aVHot damn is amazing please do listen to it!!!
p13287
aVListening to it now.
p13288
aVIts probably the most chaotic album I'd say but still catchy and fun, I'd like to see if you like it or not so please tell me!
p13289
aVI definitely like it so far, I like Keith's vocals on later albums more and like the southern edge more. But it's great. \u000a\u000a&gt;Its probably the most chaotic album \u000a\u000aIt is pretty chaotic, almost as much as Calculating Infinity. \u000a
p13290
aV&gt; almost as much as calculating infinity\u000a\u000aThat is a big call, I'd say its a bit off but still chaotic as. You should listen to their burial plot bidding war ep you wouldn't know its ETID haha just wait till you get to eblorama and there is a cool as melodic part just before it.
p13291
aVMight be because when I think of Calculating Infinity my mind goes to [Clip the Apex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtbi9CHvikY) and [Destro's Secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyyGnf9YlL0). 
p13292
aVThose songs are still super chaotic haha just i find that more chaotic than ETID but don't get me wrong i live ETID and this is no competition just i think nothing will be more chaotic than calculating infinity 
p13293
aVOh, I thought you were saying it's a big call to say Dillinger is as chaotic as ETID. \u000a\u000aI know you listen to more mathcore/metallic hardcore type stuff so you probably hear a lot more chaotic stuff than I do. 
p13294
aVOh no vice versa haha so what would you rate hot damn out of 10?\u000a\u000aMaybe some mathy grindcore is more chaotic but I'd still go calculating Infinity haha well each person is different y'know like if I want melodeath with cleans I'd message you straight away.
p13295
aV&gt;rate hot damn out of 10?\u000a\u000aHard to give something a rating after a single, cursory listen. But, it would be a high 8. And by my rating scale, that's an A, almost an S. 
p13296
aVI'm not accustom to S but it is a pretty great album it's in my top three with From Parts Unknown and The Big Dirty
p13297
aVAh, S is a video game thing. Especially games like dance dance revolutions. It's the second highest score you can get, right behind SS (in this case that would be a perfect 5). 
p13298
aVOh okay thanks for clearing that up, I had a feeling it was a video game thing as I remembered this old shooting game (ninja assault I think) had an S rating and then a U too hahaha \u000a\u000aYou've inspired me to listen to Hot Damn! Right now so thank you haha
p13299
aV&gt; Oh okay thanks for clearing that up, I had a feeling it was a video game thing as I remembered this old shooting game (ninja assault I think) had an S rating and then a U too hahaha\u000a\u000aNever played ninja assault, but yep. It's a common video game thing. Sorry if I confueed you with it. If I didn't, I also apologize. \u000a\u000a&gt;You've inspired me to listen to Hot Damn! Right now so thank you haha\u000a\u000aHaha, np. I'll probably relistn to it tomorrow myself. \u000a
p13300
aVI had it in my ps2 ahh the good old days, no problem bro I had a rough understanding ish.\u000a\u000aDo re-listen, sorry about my positivity just feeling upbeat and man ETID are sick, like they have catchy southern stuff, chaotic mathcore and then just great semi mathcore/metalcore/hardcore
p13301
aV&gt;Do re-listen,\u000a\u000aWIll do. It'll be the first thing I listen to when I wake up in the morning, maybe. Hopefully.\u000a\u000a&gt;sorry about my positivity just feeling upbeat and man ETID are sick\u000a\u000aNo no no. Don't apologize for being upbeat haha. Hard to find that kind of mood, keep it if you've got it \u000a\u000a&gt;and man ETID are sick, like they have catchy southern stuff, chaotic mathcore and then just great semi mathcore/metalcore/hardcore\u000a\u000aDefinitely. I haven't heard anything bad from them. They're amazing. I like them almost as much as killswitch. They're on my [top 50](http://i.imgur.com/ki35daW.jpg) thingy. 
p13302
aV&gt; keep it up  \u000a\u000aUnfortunately I need to sleep now and it's keeping me awake, but I still feel good at least, work is going to be harsh tomorrow , I will probably be asleep /trying to when you read this but could you link your last fm account so I can add you?\u000a\u000aNo Converge there mate :/

The work is just digging out a stream for a few hours, just tired as woke up heaps dyeing the night.\u000a\u000aWell we had "low" music compatibility but that's algoods , we still share some if my favourite bands (my plays and scrobles are a bit mucked up as its only the music I had played on Itunes on my computer)\u000a\u000aIf you like Jane Doe by them, I think you would like almost everything else, maybe try their latest LP all we love we leave behind\u000a\u000aOh and listen to this cover from converge of [a cure song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qOae_p3r9YQ) to me this song is just amazing

aVHah! Not fair bringing Dillinger into a discussion about chaos.
p13306
aVI'll say that Ex-Lives is probably a little more rowdy than their other albums. I'm not a huge fan of their first EP and album, but I don't think I've ever heard an ETID song that I didn't like.

p13313
aVAs I Lay Dying. They're all ridiculously talented musicians and didn't release a single album that somebody can say is entirely bad. And then there's An Ocean Between Us which is easily one of the best metalcore albums ever.
p13314
aVAn Ocean Between Us is basically the definition of modern  metalcore. If not ACB then Shadows Are Security.
p13315
aVConverge, they are the most loved metalcore band on /r/metal and /r/hardcore but here hardly anyone likes them. They tale awhile to get into but then you can't get enough, one of my all time favourite bands in any genre.
p13316
aVConverge is a band that I didn't understand until I really started playing and writing my own music ("music"). Trying to be an actual musician totally changed how I listen to stuff.
p13317
aVCould I ask in what way? I've played guitar averagely for awhile and picked up vocals. What caught me was how they sounded like nothing I have ever heard before and it scared me a bit to be honest.
p13318
aVI've been playing for about 15 years for perspective. I look at music like learning another language. I know a little Spanish, enough to understand and communicate basic stuff. I imagine this is approximate to how the general public understands music, so you get pop songs that sound alike because people who aren't musicians can only identify basic characteristics. They know if something is catchy, or if they can relate to a lyric or something.  Having a very basic understanding of a second language would, say, prevent me from having a conversation about the geopolitical implications of the existential philosophy of the European Union's involvement in the the Greek financial crisis in a language that isn't English. (Also not even in English. BS run-on sentence for effect.) The point is, the more fluent you are in a language, the better you can express and understand higher level conversations that would just sound like gibberish to someone else. \u000a\u000aMusic is the same way, you can probably enjoy some Mozart without studying music, but you only realize he's a genius when you understand what he was doing. I listened to Korn and Nirvana when I picked up a guitar for the first time, but I got pretty bored with them when my musicianship improved because I could really start to hear what made Megadeth riffs so interesting. Once I got to the point where I could just play scales really fast I got bored with thrash and holy shit, have you ever heard of Rush? I'm still a casual Rush fan, but I feel they lack the sort of emotional/cathartic aspect of heavier music. So fast forward to bands like Converge, who can write something that I find to be musically interesting and still have the core elements that appeal to listeners of heavy music. Even the most highly educated Spanish speaking scholars still need to ask where the bathroom is on occasion.\u000a\u000aI apologize if I undershot your question. This is more of a general answer than I think you were looking for.
p13319
aVNo this was perfect thank you for the answer it makes a lot of sense to me, I know a little bit of other languages like Latin and Spanish but the thing about the music makes so much sense, I'd say I'm a 2/10 at guitar and my problem is the songs I want to learn I'm not good enough but the stuff I can play i get bored with it.\u000a\u000aI think my appreciation for music that delved from the path just began from hearing the same catchy thing over and over again and I began a love for songs that have no structure and that were more creative. Also I find drums in a lot of popular and actually most music to be boring and not really part of it and that's something I love. You did a great explanation, thank you.\u000a\u000aI don't think I've seen you in the sub before but welcome if you are new!
p13320
aVThanks for the feedback. I've been a lurker for awhile. I don't post much in music threads because I can't honestly say that I'm a fan of any particular genre. I just cherry pick bands from all over the place. \u000a\u000aThe only real guitar advice I can offer is to find a way to take lessons from someone that teaches theory. Some people are just talented and can invent magic by ear, but that's pretty rare. Having a basic framework will make a huge difference in your ability to create something that you'd enjoy playing.
p13321
aVOkay I will try to remember this, it sounds like good advice, I was going to get lessons at school but they gave it all to the younger students so I have to find tuition elsewhere. Will try to find a good instructor. \u000a\u000aOh and in terms of bands if you like even just one band feel free to post here its a friendly sub and you seem to post in-depth informative replies

aVAs I Lay Dying (RIP)
p13323
aVThere's a shitload of bands that i love, but for an absolute favorite, its a tie between Issues &amp; I See Stars.\u000a\u000aIssues: While most might call it that generic Risecore band, they're honestly one of the most unique bands i've seen to date. It was abit sketchy when i first listened to it, but it grew on me &amp; it became one of my all time favorites. Its the small combinations of genres like RnB, EDM &amp; Metalcore that kinda made it work for me. While most see it as weird, it just goes together perfectly for me.\u000a\u000aI See Stars: A close friend of mine intro'd me to this band via New Demons. And i've been hooked to it ever since. Listening to Murder Mitten for the first time &amp; going like "Holy shit this sounds sick!". Kinda like Issues, the mixture of EDM/Dubstep with that aggressive metalcore sound made it work for me. And they're the gateway band that intro'd me to bands that uses Synths &amp; stuff. From there I tracked back to their older albums, and they're all great too.

p13334
aVAttila's licks aren't tasty enough
p13335
aVAll That Remains. Even though they get shit on a lot for being pretty inconsistent and "generic" since The Fall of Ideals, something about the signature sound they create as a group really gets me. So no matter what they make, Phil's voice and Oli's guitar work will get me going.\u000a\u000aTied for second: Killswitch Engage and Trivium, with WtF A7X clinging on for a spot.

aVCan't decide between Hopesfall and Norma Jean..\u000aThey're rather hardcore though. I used to listen to songs made by a music mash-up team called "The Legion of Doom" (was looking up random RuneScape music videos and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx-QlVsOvcM)) I really liked the remix of Hardcore and Post Hardcore songs which ultimatively got me into Metalcore. I then proceeded with TDWP, ABR, BMTH, Parkway Drive and all that generic stuff lol.\u000a\u000aOther than that, I'm a diehard Erra fan since Andromeda EP\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: Just realized I had like 5k Underoath scrobbles on my last.fm accounts, guess I found the winner

p13410
aVOne of my top 3 bands right now :)
p13411
aVMy band will have lyrics like that, but for a proper band I actually think Every Time I Die have some deep lyrics if you look beyond the surface, may just be because I looked too deep into them, like from Parts unknown the lyrics made me think about death and the meaningless of everything, which some of it is true but quite a lot may just be my thought process.\u000a\u000aEdit: For post hardcore bands, Touche Amore's Is Survived By was really thought provoking and La Dispute is as always if you get into the lyrics.
p13412
aVThey definitely have some great lyrics
p13413
aVTheir early stuff has lots of funny lyrics, well they all are upto From Parts Unknown. Keith is a great lyricist.
p13414
aVThe albums that to me at least seemed to have especially great lyrics were New Junk Aesthetic and From Parts Unknown, that might just be because those are what I'm most familiar with though
p13415
aVBoth of them were great, FPU were maybe my favourite, I enjoyed all but gutter phenomenon were average in my opinion ( there first album and ex lives I haven't gone through all the lyrics)
p13416
aVEx Lives is their masterpiece imo.
p13417
aVI have to re try that album
p13418
aVDefinitely agree with ETID. From Parts Unknown's lyrics definitely provoke a lot of thought.
p13419
aVAgreed. Though their earlier albums do carry some thought provoking content, it isnt until NJA that it goes overboard. From cynicism (NJA) to nihilism (Ex-L) to an attempt at salvation or atonement (FPU), Keith pretty much takes through a whirlwind of a fucked up psyche, spouting lyrical genius throughout.\u000a\u000aIdk man i just really like etid that i always think about it, this is just my opinion tho. Im probably wrong.
p13420

aVI've never heard of this band. What are some songs that you would recommend?
p13428
aVTDWP, Architects, August Burns Red
p13429
aVDAE?
p13430
aVAttila 8)
p13431
aV[I found this brilliant analysis of some of their new album's lyrics!](http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-brilliant-lyrics-of-attila-guilty-pleasure)
p13432
aVSome George Orwell type stuff. 
p13433
aV/r/metalcore probably isn't the best sub to asking this question in haha
p13434
aVHaha I get what you're saying but it isn't always that way. I think that metalcore has the potential to allow the expression of a lot of deeper thinking, but at the moment most of the genre seems to be headed away from that direction. There are still bands who deal with deeper subject matter. \u000a\u000aAlso, I do listen to a lot of other genres and I try to look for thought provoking lyrical content in whatever genre it may be. :)
p13435
aVI feel ya. It's just hard to find bands in this genre that know how to write anything more than, "THE WAVES ARE PULLING ME UNDER....BLEGH!" But you're right, there are exceptions
p13436
asVAdestria - Oh The Places You'll Go EP
p13437
(lp13438
VI'm assuming you already did this, but scavenge all the band merch sites, amazon, ebay, etc... I was at the show that they released the EP at, although I'm not even certain that they made many copies after then. 
p13439
aVThey only made 100 copies, they all got sold at that show. im not the one looking for it, it's a guy I knows holy grail of physical cd's. Im just trying to find leads for him. Do you know anyone personally at that show who happened to buy one that night? This dude is ready to throw a lot of money for a copy 
p13440
aVI'm not gonna lie I did grab a copy when I was there, but I'm away at school right now and it's back at home somewhere. I knew a lot of the people at the show so I'm sure I know someone else who has one, it's been a minute though. \u000a\u000a/u/BackslashingfourthV mentioned a re-pressing? Maybe if your buddy hit them up on Facebook. You guys from SD? I used to fairly close with Adestria and sell tickets back before they got big, but lost touch once they started touring. 
p13441
aVMy buddy is apparently friends with one of the members and none of the members have a copy and they dont plan on a repress. If you could get in contact with anyone from back in the day, or anyway for me to keep in contact with you for when you're back home from school. My friend is willing to drop up to 200 bucks for a copy. 
p13442
aVOh shit you weren't kidding. \u000a\u000aI'll be back in SD around mid-march if that's not too long a wait, otherwise I'm not trippin. If you want I can PM my e-mail or #. 
p13443
aVPM me both, and i'll send them along to my buddy. Hes been searching for 5 years he is more then willing to wait until March.
p13444
aVCan you ask them what's up with the band? They haven't updated their facebook since late-October.
p13445
aVThey mentioned on facebook a few months ago if anyone would be interested in them re-pressing physical copies of that EP. They never followed up on that though.
p13446
asVArchitects - Unbeliever Lyric Video. I thought the video conveys the meaning of the song extremely well, too good not to share.
p13447
(lp13448
VYou know I've listened to this song a lot and never actually looked up what Sam screams in the end, and now the whole song is totally different and better now that I know what he is saying, love it
p13449
aVOne of my favourite Architects songs, even more beautiful with this video!
p13450
asVDarke Complex (formerly Widow) - Desperation
p13451
(lp13452
sVVolumes - Vahle (2014)
p13453
(lp13454
VI love this album and I don't understand why people dislike it aside from how short it is.
p13455
aVThe main negative feedback I've heard is that people aren't happy that they've decided to include more cleans on this album compared to their first. I'm not one of them though, I think this album is incredible.
p13456
aVI still think the pre-production demo version was slightly superior, especially with higher emphasis on atmospheric backtones. 
p13457
aVI dislike it because I'm incredibly tired of hearing the same djenty syncopated chugs over and over. so many bands do it and it's just not interesting at all. 
p13458
aVThis is my absolute favorite song from this album. It tells a good story too.
p13459
aVDo you even The Mixture, bro?
p13460
aVThe single pre-production version is awesome. I really disliked the album version because of its lack of reverb and space. 
p13461
asVWe need to stop yelling at Phil Labonte (All That Remains) and start talking to him.
p13462
(lp13463
VNo, this isn't how it works. Phil Labonte is a grown ass man with a really stupid opinion. How fucking dare this article say that the reaction to his comments is "political correctness" (which isn't even a real fucking thing, oh my god) when Phil literally said that gays don't go through the kind of horrors that blacks went through in the 1950s and therefore they don't have claim to feeling persecuted. Of course there aren't mass lynchings and organized attacks against gays, because we (thankfully) have progressed THAT far as a society in 60 years. But to say outright that gays are not facing persecution as a modern equivalent to what blacks went through is bullshit.\u000a\u000a[Things like this still happen.](http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/26529976/police-gay-couple-beaten-in-center-city)\u000a\u000a[Gays ARE killed solely for being gay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard)\u000a\u000a[Not to mention that transgender people are even MORE persecuted against than gays, and are more likely to be victims of violence](http://colorlines.com/archives/2014/12/black_trans_woman_killed_while_pounding_on_compton_door_for_help.html)\u000a\u000a[Suicide rate plays into this too](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_among_LGBT_youth)\u000a\u000a[Gays are still getting made out to be public spectacles](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/15/lgbt-students-harassed-at_n_717992.html)\u000a\u000a[And just as importantly, trans* people are still very much at the forefront of this as well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Leelah_Alcorn)\u000a\u000aSo this isn't about "political correctness" or whatever, it's about Phil Labonte being a stupid asshole who can't recant his dumb statement because he's got too much pride. He could be given all the reasons in the world, he could be talked to by anyone until his ears bleed, he'll never change. That's how those people operate.
p13464
aVI loved reading this. Thanks!
p13465
aVI can see where he's coming from. I don't 100% agree, but I'm not about to bash him for speaking his opinion. 
p13466
asVIf you guys were UFC fighters, which song would you use as your intro music?
p13467
(lp13468
VBreak Shit - Attila
p13469
aVFUCK THIS SHIT, PUNCH THAT BITCH
p13470
aVIf it doesn't have to be metalcore, [Immolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZStG75GS7Y) by Thy Art is Murder. \u000a\u000aIf it does, [The Beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSzJmzojRjw) by As I Lay Dying. \u000a\u000aOr, assuming it doesn't have to be the beginning of the song. I'd go with [Behind Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPnyY1A9gjI) by In Flames, specifically the part that starts at 2:41. 
p13471
aVCancer Bats - Hail Destroyer \u000a\u000a[TEAR IT DOWN!](http://youtu.be/u-FQ-AzrUkc?t=3s)
p13472
aVThey have heaps of good songs for it haha
p13473
aVI Am King by Code Orange
p13474
aVYes! I would say let the first start and stop go, then you walk in, giving a bit of a tease. one problem is you have to try to fit in the I am King part .\u000a\u000aI don't watch UFC so I don't know how long the entrance takes, but boxing its about a minute and half.
p13475
aVReign of Darkness by Thy Art is Murder. Not metalcore, I know, but definitely the song I'd use. I used it on my last amateur fight.
p13476
aVDude that is awesome! That's actually the song I would use too haha. You were probably focused on your fight, but how did people react to that song when you came out?
p13477
aVA lot of covering ears, terrified looks, and disgust of course. I got so focused people said I looked like I was about to just lose it on my opponent. I remember the guy I was fighting actually asked the ref "I have to fight this guy?"
p13478
aVThat was the perfect song choice then. You instilled fear in your opponent, and scared the audience. You probably looked like a crazed lunatic walking out to this. I'm just picturing this whole scene and laughing my ass off, great job!
p13479
aVAs I Lay Dying - Nothing Left

p13482
aVI have ideas like this sometimes
p13483
aVCarrion - Parkway Drive
p13484
aVI've always thought about this, would have to be [In Hearts Wake - Survival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KliVy6dRoiA)\u000a\u000aor [Desolated - End of the line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onTgzUoCcHY)
p13485
aVI was watching the Ronda Rousey fight on Saturday and I started thinking about what I would choose haha.
p13486
aVI'm so happy I didn't stay up to watch that fight (I live in the UK), from what I've heard the card was pretty decent though. What would you choose to walk out to?
p13487
aVIt was actually a really great card, and I think that helped not feel so bad about the Ronda fight ending so quickly.\u000a\u000aI think I would have Thy Art is Murder - Reign in Darkness as my opener. Has a nice slow build up to just super heaviness.
p13488
aVTony Danza - The Alpha ~ The Omega
p13489
aVRISE OF THE NORTHSTAR - [Welcame (Furyo State of Mind)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW_y31bRW3M)\u000a\u000aThis band exist to make you feel like a UFC fighter.

p13492
aVnot going to lie, this is something that my mma coach and i have discussed about. he's adamant i need something for when i go to do my amateur fights later on this year. i told him if you're going to force me to do this, then it's going to be avrial lavengisn girlfriend just to piss people off
p13493
aVBro go I am King or My World by Code Orange

aVYeah bro, it just makes you want to fight or break something
p13499
aVOne of my best friends walked out with August Burns Red - Up against the ropes for his first ever amateur mma fight. I talked him into using that, he originally wanted to use The Ghost Inside - The great unknown, which also would've been pretty sweet. 
p13500
aVCallout - Attila. I'd walk out just after the beatboxing when the guitar and stuff hits. 
p13501
aVWhite Washed-August Burns Red

VThis was the album that got me into metalcore.
p13525
aVThe transition from the previous song, Nothing Left and this one startles me every time. 
p13526
aVThis CD was and prob always will be on my top 10 metal CDs. But what Timmy did honestly makes me ashamed to wear my aild shirt.
p13527
aVThat intro is so orgasmic, sometimes I play this song 10 times just to listen to the intro.
p13528
aVFirst AILD song I heard. Blew my fucking world wide open.
p13529
aVThis song played live is a killer. 
p13530
aVI used to jog to this song and it never fails to kick off a runners high at 2:07. Start sprinting, and smiling and fake singing.

p13543
asVWhich should be the first single released by a band?
p13544
(lp13545
VThe one that best represents the direction/theme of the album
p13546
aVIf a band has already decided that there's a "best" or "worst" song before the album has even come out, then they probably haven't made a very good album. I can understand that many bands will be more critical of their work post-release, a few months or years down the track, but pre-release they should be proud of every track on that album, and for that reason I don't think they would consciously choose a "best" or "worst" song to release as the first single.\u000a\u000aAccessibility and catchiness are probably two pretty important factors - if your first listen of a band is one you enjoy and remember then you'll be more likely to follow the band in anticipation of future singles and, ultimately, pick up the new album. Mission accomplished. This doesn't need to be the best song on the album, but one that is memorable. Take Beartooth's first single "I Have A Problem", for example; the repeated lyrics in the introduction highlight Caleb's harsh vocals (the selling point of the whole project) and grab your attention, while the end of the track features repetition of the "I have a problem" lyric. Repetition is a pretty sure-fire way to get fans engaged and learning the lyrics. This is particularly useful when bands do a string of shows before the albums release - catchy lyrics are more engaging, allow fans to become more involved in the live experience, and will leave a longlasting impression on them long after the show has ended, eventually leading many fans to preorder the new release, or at least pick it up shortly after release.
p13547
aVneither, release the title track, if there is no title track, release the one you think is the most likely to cause talk 
p13548
aVI'd say release the most representative track first, and then the most non-conventional track second. That way there's a distinct contrast in the flavours of the album.
p13549
aVThe song most likely to get the attention of their intended audience. Not the radio friendly catchy song, but the one that gets the hardcore fans' attention.\u000a\u000aMost of the time it's the radio friendly single released first though and we all roll our eyes because we know that's exactly what it is, and (hopefully) the rest of the album is what we actually want.
p13550
aVMy band and I released our song with the catchiest chorus and it also had a feature.
p13551
aVThat's what I would have done. Release the one you think will appeal to the most people. And a feature cant hurt.
p13552
