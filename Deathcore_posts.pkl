sVLucas Mann is a Ditto
p54
VOne time, in a galaxy far ago, there lived a Ditto. He was the only Ditto in the Ditto World that liked deathcore, and since he couldn't afford to record everything himself, he decided to tear apart the fabric of the universe, crawl through the cavernous cavity that was left by the incision, and emerge through the flesh of space and time into our own dimensional plane. While exploring this new land, the Ditto overheard a young Lucas Mann practicing with his new band, Rings Of Saturn. After listening in on song after song of unrelenting breakdowns and a cascade of machine-like guitar wankery that can only be described as the sound of two cyborg-alien moss piglets fucking to [this song.](http://youtu.be/ygI-2F8ApUM)\u000a\u000aOnly that song in particular. Nothing else.\u000a\u000aThe Ditto thought Lucas Mann was trying to kill him and devour his soul, because Rings of Saturn is all like, aliens 'n shit...So out of fear for his life he inhaled Lucas Mann and transformed himself into a complete replica of his physical form.\u000a\u000aBecause this particular Ditto is also part Kirby, and *those inhales.*\u000a\u000aSince then, this Ditto has been impersonating Lucas Mann and operating as the guitarist of Rings of Saturn. \u000a\u000aDue to recent allegations made by the former guitarist Joel something, it has become a common subject of debate amongst people in the deathcore community, many of whom believe that Lucas Mann 'fakes it', and relies on digital audio programs and MIDI controllers to produce the sound of his guitar work, instead of actually playing it. There have also been claims made that Lucas Mann *does* legitimately record his own guitar, but does so literally note by note, and pressures other members of the band to match his recording process in the same fashion. Although, I feel like that would take a ridiculously long time, and I can't imagine being able to flesh out such an outstanding record as their newest album, entitled Kugal Jet Li or some shit, with that kind of recording process.\u000a\u000aBut when it comes down to it, the negative press surrounding Lucas Mann isn't really even about him. It's about the Ditto. The Ditto that has been living his life in his place for nearly a decade.\u000a\u000aI know this must be some rather shocking information for you to hear, and I do, myself empathise. It was a surprising discovery to those who discovered it, and we urge you to think clearly and rationally about the subject at hand. Lucas Mann is actually a Ditto, and it has now become imperative that this knowledge be made public.\u000a\u000aFor those of you who may have your doubts, we understand, it *is* rather unbelievable. For you, and for those who don't know who Lucas Mann is or what a Ditto is, here is a side-by-side comparison of them.\u000a\u000a[A Ditto](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/pokemon-blue-version/d/dd/Ditto.gif)  \u000a[Lucas Mann](http://www.metal-archives.com/images/1/4/7/9/14792_artist.jpg?4732)\u000a\u000aAstonishing, isn't it? Lucas Mann is a Ditto.\u000a\u000aWith that, I bid you farewell /r/Deathcore, and hope you have a nice day.

sVDeathcore Suggestions?
p149
VLately I've grown tired of my music collection. I listen to all kinds of metal, but I've been slowly moving towards heavier deathcore. I like simple songs, not overly progressive. Stuff with slow breakdowns. Really I'll listen to anything with a lot of heavy breakdowns. I've just been in that mood lately. As a basis, I like early Chelsea Grin, Whitechapel, Thy Art Is Murder, Aversions Crown, etc. I'm still relatively new to the genre, I grew up listening to metalcore. Again I love all forms of metal so any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks.\u000a\u000a*EDIT: I should add that I have been drumming for about 10 years. Any bands with exceptional drumming is a bonus for me.

It seems like it is not very common in other European countries as well. Usually on the internet I see these 18+ restriction in USA/Australia and especially for concerts of deathcore bands, but I have no idea whether is has got something to do with the genre or with the venue or something.

VPreviously I was a huge fan of death metal and had bad opinions on deathcore mainly because I thought it was all scene kid bullshit for teenagers. Then I learned there was more to deathcore than suicide silence and BMTH.\u000a\u000aIt has all the elements that I love of death metal - the blast beats, tremolo picking, the dark evil themes, etc... *but* it has brain melting breakdowns which just make it so much better than traditional death metal IMO.\u000a\u000aAlso, the production values seem to be a lot higher which I really really prefer in metal. Its probably why I cant get into black metal. I can tolerate a lot of death metal because I grew up with it... but the production in a lot of deathcore stuff has spoiled me and it just isn't the same going back listening to some of my old favorite dm stuff.

Nothing is more annoying than playing a show out of state and having 20 people the day after saying, "WTF? You guys were 5 minutes down the road! Why didn't I know?!" Thanks!\u000a\u000a-Ryan\u000a\u000a

sVIngested - Beginners Guide (2006 - 2015)
p268
V**Ingested Beginners Guide**\u000a\u000aAfter the recent release of Archetect of Extinction, and the awesome work of /u/dspang, I wanted to create a beginners guide for Ingetsted. I hope you enjoy it, and I hope we can have some good discussions around it. At a high level, if you like Acrania, Suicide Silence (the cleansing), Vulvodynia, AngelMaker - this is your jams right here. \u000a\u000a**Holy Butchery - 2006**\u000a\u000aThe album opens with that nice crunchy, classic myspace deathcore sound. The quality of the sound reminiscences Suicide Silence\u2019s self-titled EP. It gives the feels of that classic 2006 myspace feel when, if you are like me, you were in high school, and it\u2019s nostalgic as shit. On The Holy Butchery, the vocals transition from lows, to highs with thick, gurgling slam vocals sprinkled throughout. Though the recording quality isn\u2019t the stuff we hear now in 2015, you can definitely hear the Ingested sound. The formula is still there \u2014 fast blast beats, tremolo picking out the ass, rivers of triplets, and some really solid, thick, heavy breakdowns. What is missing from this album that you\u2019ll hear in later Ingested albums is the maturity of blending death metal, slam, and deathcore. This is very much a deathcore/slam/brutally focused album. \u000a\u000aMy favorite parts are the unrelenting slam breakdowns and stomps they go into. It feels so classic. A lot of them are generic and you can feel them coming; however, they are still creative in their use of these elements considering how other bands were using them at this time. The ending track Joined by Digestion gives a good taste of what is to be expected next from Ingested release. \u000a\u000aNotable mentions: Erotic Depravity, Copromesis, Joined by Digestion\u000a\u000a**Surpassing the Boundries of Human Suffering - 2009**\u000a\u000aFastforward 3 years and Ingested released their first full length. It begins with a tremolo picking build up dropping into the same heaviness we loved on their first effort. However this time, the recording quality is much better. Quality reminds me of Signal the Firing Squad\u2019s album Abnegate. The sound from Holy Butchery has evolved quite a bit introducing new elements into how they form their chords. There is no loss in heaviness, but there is a focus on using more than just the top two strings to make a chord. This creates a sound scape not present in the first album. They include 3 songs from their EP re-done on the album, and they sound even better.\u000a\u000aSkinned and Fucked is a great example for where Ingested was heading at this time. You can clearly hear infant elements of Architect of Intinction in this album. The speed and cadence of their sound is really established for what later Ingested albums would feel like. \u000a\u000aOne of my favorite parts of Ingested are their stomp riffs. Most of the time, Ingested puts a nasty little dark beat to them. This is the first album where that is present. There is a clear beat and cadence to each stomp, making me feel like I\u2019m in a dark murderous march hellscape.\u000a\u000aThe vocals do change a bit on this album. They lose some of the slam qualities present in the first album (this isn\u2019t a bad thing as the variety really does a lot to make the album more interesting). They also double up the vocals now as well for the first time mixing high + lows at the same time. \u000a\u000aNotable mentions: Skinned and Fucked, Intercranial Semen Injection, Stillborn, Condemned to Rape\u000a\u000a**The Surreption - 2011**\u000a\u000aThis is the only Ingested album to date that starts off with a cut scene. It\u2019s from the movie The Rite: "Not believing in the devil won't protect you from him.\u201d Good ol\u2019 Anthony Hopkins. The first track shows a new side of Ingested. The whole album feels like an experiment in some ways. This is the first time we hear clean shouty hardcore vocals on an album. The feel of the album is more structured and feels more straight forward as opposed to Surpassing the Boundries of Human Suffering. \u000a\u000aThey still have the Ingested sounds, but it almost has a military timing to it - and I really like it on this album. It is a great mix between old school deathcore and new school deathcore. They add in this ambient hymns in the background / synth giving it that mystical value not present in the first two albums. However, they still have fast paced parts, stomps, and over the top breakdowns. The song, Omega, the last song on the album is Ingested\u2019s first instrumental track on one of their CDs. \u000a\u000aThe vocals have improved a lot; they are clearer, the highs are higher and on point throughout. A lot of this is also due to the overall rise in production quality on the album as well. More structure is not a bad thing for Ingested. Their song structure feels intricate. Each riff feels placed thoughtfully to stay in time with the rest of the song/album based on a very specific theme.\u000a\u000aThere is a clear focus on developing riffs and lead ins that is absent (ok, they\u2019re there just not as well thought out) from the first two albums. A lot more pausing in time to add emphasis to different elements, not just breakdowns, we\u2019re talking every element. "Would this sound cool if we fucked with the timing on it?\u201d This is the question I feel they asked on every track. \u000a\u000aThis may have been where their sound matured, but in it, they lost the raw anger from the previous two cds for me. They also begin to experiment with other kinds of guitar i.e. clean guitar riffs for emphasis. This albums feels like a time to try a lot of new things out. They have their first vocal only intro on the 3rd track and the the album\u2019s hardcore shouting vocals are also new for them. Overall the tone of the album is more deathcore/hardcore leaving out some of the deathy elements. \u000a\u000aNotable mentions: Crowning the Abomination, Deline, Disgusting Revelation, Manifesting Obscenity, Alpha / Omegan (together, always together). \u000a\u000a**Revered By No One, Feared By All EP - 2013**\u000a\u000aThis is a perfect name for this album because this EP goes hard from start to finish. There is no break for your face melting between tracks. No slow build ups to the next song. No hardcore vocals. Just fast, hard, viscous shit. This is the realization of the Ingested sound we hear in Architect of Extinction  The vocals are there in the monstrous doubled slam lows on those insane highs. The guitar tone is there and huge with a lot of creativity in transitions and attention to the mood an accent note on any chord makes. \u000a\u000aThey embraced more chordy, deathy riffs where appropriate which really added a new dimension onto these guys I don\u2019t feel was fully explored until this EP. \u000a\u000aThe album starts off with some sweet palm mute, chord driven breakdowns. There is a lot more complexity in the sound than just a straight open note breakdowns. And did I mention there are filthy stomps through out this album. They really played to the death metal and slam elements that were always in their music, but now they seem to know the recipe to get the sound they want. The unique piece to this album to me is the mathy feel it can have at times. I would say that is the special piece of this album you may not get from Architect of Extinction which makes this a standout effort. \u000a\u000aFirst two songs give a taste of the old, last two songs really, really give a taste of the new (imo). Uncrowned sounds like it could be off of Architect of Extinction. \u000a\u000aNotable mentions: Titanonmachy, Uncrowned \u000a\u000a**Architect of Extinction - 2015**\u000a\u000aI have not listened to a new release this much straight since Acrania\u2019s Totalitarian Dystopia or since I first found And Hell Followed With's Proprioception. So, bear in mind I am approaching it in that way before you read this\u2026 this album kicks the devil in the nuts and then sits on his thrown. This will be my album of the year. \u000a\u000aThe first track, Divine Right of Kings, sets the tone for what to expect on the whole album. The pause before the epic first breakdown and then the lows start. The vocals are layered in a way that sounds awesome reminding me a bit of Lorelei or Ovid\u2019s Withering mixed with Acrania + Vulvodynia throughout the whole album. The guitars sound like a beefy machine gun being fired. \u000a\u000aWhat really does it for me on this album is the mood. There is a consistent mood throughout the whole album. It\u2019s dark and really fits the team of the album which feels very dystopian. They evoke this emotion in every part of the album. The Elliot Rodgers quote - \u201cHumanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species\u201d (there\u2019s more, but too lazy to type all out) really sets this album into another state of erie. This is a pretty recent event, and in the context of what he did, leading into The Heir To Mankind\u2019s Atrocities it feels pretty fitting. \u000a\u000aThey really drive home the mood with the dark, deathy chords they use mixed with their timing. It\u2019s like a high speed train crash in perfect unison and under the control of someone. Though it may sound chaotic, there is always a lower beat / feel that is there. My favorite part of this album are the triplet rolled stomps. The best of these, for me, is in Extinction Event (\u201cI AM THE ARCHITECT OF EXTINCTION\u201d). The cadence of this song is incredible. It just rolls over and over just bashing in your skull. Favorite song on the album - it\u2019s heavy as Roseanne too. \u000a\u000aIf you are going to listen to any album of this list. It\u2019s this one. \u000a\u000aNotable mentions: THE WHOLE ALBUM. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

sVHistory of Deathcore?
p271
VI've been a fan of deathcore as well as some early metalcore for a long time and i've always taken an interest in noting how things change over time in both the music itself and the scene built around it. Recently I've been thinking that it would be cool if there was some sort of 'History of Deathcore' explaining how the genre was created and evolved over time. \u000a\u000aDoes anything like this exist already? If not, I'd like your help in naming the most important early Deathcore bands as well as some of their precursors.

p281
VIt was a great show. It was a small venue so it was cool being up close to the action. Not a huge turn out. \u000a\u000aRings of Saturn killed it, BUT, they only played old stuff. I had a chance to talk to Ian, and he said since they live in different states they didn't have an opportunity to practice before going on tour which was a little disappointing. (He also signed [this awesome Dingir poster](http://imgur.com/eDYtNMO) though which was cool). Still an awesome performance nonetheless. \u000a\u000aAs Blood Runs Black was good, but they were hard to take serious. There singer looks like a metal Justin Bieber; however, they did play a lot of new stuff. It was a pretty heavy live. I think they new album will be awesome. They also played a few old songs off of Allegiance which was cool. \u000a\u000aIf you have a chance to see this show, I would definitely go for it. Suicide Silence / Chelsea Grin Sunday!

p283
VHello! This is my first time posting here, so I don't know if this is the right place or not. \u000a\u000aI found a band a little while back, and I really like their style of deathcore. The band is called Upon a Red Sky. Here are some links: \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQTm_pOIctE\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvKXsWkjiCo\u000a\u000aI'm not a massive fan of many of the -core genres, but I like some deathcore. Stuff like Upon a Red Sky and Aegaeon. Lots of growls, not so much scream, not many freaky sounds (pig squeals, etc.), heavy mastering, and very frantic breakdowns (like lots of notes very close together and spastically). I could just be being really picky here, I don't know :P\u000a\u000aIf anyone has any bands that are similar to Upon a Red Sky, I would be interested in looking them up :) cheers!

sVWhy Deathcore is the best music
p360
VI listened to a lot of different music. It started as a teen in the late 90's with nu-metal shit like Disturbed and Godsmack. Then came hardcore. I was into everything from Bleeding Through and Terror to Martyr A.D. and Black My Heart. After many years (01-08) of hardcore I ended up listening to opera shit like Nightwish and Epica and then trailed off into dubstep and forgot about metal. Then my new best friend showed me Deathcore, and bands like Rings of Saturn, Hail to the King, Carnifex and Whitechapel have given me a new focus on good music.\u000a\u000aAnyway, long live deathcore, sorry for the drunken rant, raise a pint and toast to your favorite FUCKING BRUTAL band!\u000a\u000aEDIT: What's your favorite band and why is Deathcore the best, motherfuckers?

p407
VSo I stopped listening to metal like 2 years ago. But my lifelong best friend recently passed away and I wanted to get back into it and remember the old days. He introduced me to BMTH and Slipknot in high school, and was himself a vocalist/guitarist/drummer/everything (check out his band Brandywine).\u000a\u000aAnyways, I made a playlist of my favorite songs, and was wondering if you guys had suggestions of TRACKS that sound similar. I'm looking for specific songs, not just band names. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNoolewg3H8QXezt59p6gWdwSrZ9eCm_6\u000a\u000a- No clean vocals\u000a- No group/gang vocals\u000a- No pig squeals\u000a- No electronic or ambient parts\u000a- Brutal, heavy, makes you want to kill someone\u000a- High energy, something you could work out to\u000a- No emotional/slow/sad parts\u000a- Don't care much about technical skill, I just like the brutal sound\u000a\u000aAnd to help you further understand my taste, here's some songs that I don't like, and I tell you why I don't.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BUD0hzxkwk - Don't like the guy's voice, similar to the guy's in Whitechapel which I don't like. Doesn't sound angry/brutal/vicious enough.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2d-o86qJH8 - Don't like the voice. Sounds pig squealy and similar to above.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwfp3pWndGE - This is pretty much perfect besides the clean vocals. His clean vocals just ruin it. The screams he does are pretty damn good though.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UESpQMpUgHU - Voice sounds off, kind of pig squeally. And the band can't get a good melody going. The drums are hitting too fast, it seems like a musical mess.\u000a

Some bands I like are Bullet For My Valentine, Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, Trivium, In Flames. I like screaming vocals with a mixture of clean vocals too, but I don't think I'll find too much clean vocals in deathcore, right?\u000a\u000aEh, yeah, so please, what's a good band/album to start with to get into deathcore? I'd like to possibly see all of the different aspects of deathcore \u2013 tempo changes, key changes ^(?), experimental instruments, etc.\u000a\u000a*(Also, if you could provide a YouTube link to the song/album, I'd great appreciate it!)*\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a\u000a*EDIT*: Thanks everyone for your suggestions!

sVDeathcore with a lot of tremolo picking?
p539
VHello, ive noticed that deathcore (or any metal really) with a lot of tremolo picking gives me the biggest eargasms, even more so than a good breakdown. One of my favorite bands that did this a lot was As Blood Runs Black (in their first album at least)\u000a\u000a[As Blood Runs Black - In Dying Days](http://youtu.be/sdU_pT0KXSI?t=2m41s)\u000a\u000a[As Blood Runs Black - Legends Never Die](http://youtu.be/cF4OqYUD690?t=1m33s)\u000a\u000a[As Blood Runs Black - Strife](http://youtu.be/LN5Uy9u1DLk?t=24s)\u000a\u000a[Job For A Cowboy - Relinquished](http://youtu.be/LgOqqCl2f1w?t=28s)\u000a\u000aI hope you get the point by now. Anyways, I was just wondering if you guys could direct me to some bands/albums that have this shit everywhere (such as ABRB's Allegiance album)\u000a\u000a**edit:** and I pray to moonjesus that this is actually what tremolo picking is. I don't play the guitar so i'm not 100% confident in my ability to not embarrass myself here\u000a\u000aif its not tremolo picking, at least you understand what im talking about now haha \u000a\u000a**edit 2:** BTW I should say that you don't have to recommend me only deathcore bands/albums. I love any metal with this stuff in it, ESPECIALLY the more evil sound that goes along with deathcore and blackmetal (I think these examples were played in the minor scale? .. again im not a guitar guy im not sure) The only reason I know about 'scales' is because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq8ODuozdIo) hilarious video. \u000a\u000a

sVI'm looking for good deathcore bands.
p575
VI already listen to a little deathcore, but not enough to call myself an expert on the genre. Looking for some talented bands that aren't just full of break downs and generic chugs. I love break downs, don't get me wrong, just not all the time, So far I already listen to:\u000a\u000a\u005c&gt;Bring Me The Horizon (Old and new)\u000a\u000a\u005c&gt;Whitechapel\u000a\u000a\u005c&gt;Make Them Suffer\u000a\u000a\u005c&gt;Thy Art Is Murder\u000a\u000a\u005c&gt;Suicide Silence\u000a\u000a\u005c&gt;Veil Of Maya (recently)\u000a

sVYoung folks, how have you found your way to the subgenre Deathcore?
p579
VAs the title says: Younger people of this subreddit, could you explain to me how you\u2019ve found your musical way into listening to Deathcore bands? What kind of bands have you listened before entering this type of music? What was the path you took?\u000a\u000aThe reason why I ask is pure interest: Yesterday, I\u2019ve been to a show of Suicide Silence and Thy Art is Murder and I\u2019ve seen a lot of younger fans (I myself am 26 years old). In one of the breaks in between the bands playing, the DJ played a Korn song, and I suddenly remembered some of the bands I listened to in my teens and how my music taste changed over the years and how one band led to another.\u000a\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s my story as a comparison: Everything started with Korn: My older cousin gave me \u201cFollow the leader\u201d as a birthday present when I became 12 years old. After a lot of New Metal bands I went on to Iced Earth, Metallica, Sodom, Exedus, and so on, right before discovering growls and screams with Dimmu Borgir, Death, Behemoth and many others (popular Black Metal led to Death Metal). After that I was always looking for more extreme stuff and finished my first journey in the Metal Scene with Slam Death Metal such as Devourment and Crepitation. At this time, the Metalcore scene grew bigger and bigger in Europe and I appreciated the breeze of fresh air in the classic Metal scene, which I personally found to be very conservative and superficial after I outgrew from puberty. After a few years listening to other stuff than Metal, I started again by listening to some Hardcore, Metalcore and Deathcore; for me, Deathcore being a nice mix between my past and the newer stuff.\u000a\u000aI guess that I entered the Deathcore genre by coming from more classic ways of Extreme Metal. Is it different for younger people these days? I am very interested in your stories!\u000a
p580
sVFavorite release today (Sever the King, Acacia Strain, Rings of Saturn, and Enterprise Earth)
p581
VToday was a great day for Deathcore [Rings of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6oSVDU_Tvg), [Sever the King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpPfwxsA6zA), [The Acacia Strain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5qnyrCec5w), and [Enterprise Earth](https://soundcloud.com/wearetriumphant/sets/enterprise-earth-23) all dropped albums. There are probably more, and please add the ones I missed.\u000a\u000a- Which one do you like best and why? \u000a\u000aFor me, it is very close between Sever the King and Rings of Saturn, but I would have to pick Rings of Saturn. Mainly because it sounds like space + heavy which is too good. Also, Enterprise Earth's first full CD should be epic. Some of these definitely AOTY potential.

VI discovered this band from Australia a couple years ago called A Dead Silence. Here is a [sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8sgjltkGGs). They released an ep titled 'Catharsis' in 2012. It's one of my favourite eps of all time! Naturally, Iliked them on facebook so that I could stay informed about their future releases. Well, they talked about how they were going to release an album in Fall of 2014... but never did. There has also not been any activity on their page since November of last year... Just wondering if anyone knows anything about this band? Did they break up? Financial troubles? Whatever it is, it's really too bad. I thought this band had a lot of promise.\u000a

sVThe Acacia Strain Guide
p723
VSo here is my Acacia Strain Guide.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as the All Shall Perish one.  Bit of a warning though.  It is a big read.  Let me know what you think.  \u000a\u005cm/\u000a\u000aThe Acacia Strain are a band that I have been an ardent fan of for a quite some time.  I first got \u201c3750\u201d and \u201cThe Dead Walk around 2006 for Christmas.  Those two albums were in any and all forms of my mp3/cd players for a good year or so.  I\u2019d listen to other stuff but would revert to listening to those two albums.  I was hooked.  Both albums just had an unrivaled(to these ears) amount of anger and heaviness in them that just spoke to me in spades.  So since the All Shall Perish guide went over pretty well, it seemed pertinent to do one on The Acacia Strain.  Once again I\u2019m going to focus on the studio albums.  The band has been through a few changes in sound over time.  \u000a-**...And Life is Very Long** - You know, I really hated this album at first when I heard it many years back.  It sounded so damn generic.  It literally sounded like any metalcore band that was out at the time of it\u2019s inception.  So it collected dust for a loooooonnnnnggggg time.  Until I started writing this guide.  However, you know what?  I can\u2019t fault them for this.  Also, with fresh ears, it\u2019s not nearly as bad as many made it out to be.  Even the band themselves.  The thing is, the band was young in this stage.  They were still looking for an identity.  So they grasped onto what a lot of typical metalcore was doing at this time.  Fast melodic riffs with some breakdowns.  However, listening to it today.  The breakdowns on this really are not bad at all.  They do get you wanting to mosh a bit.  Though with the pretty thin production of the day(most likely budgetary constraints, most bands starting out have to really work to get a good sound for less money.) that takes from some of the heaviness.  With the use of the breakdowns on this one though, one can tell how the band really wanted to go in future releases.  Not bad.  Not great though.  It was an early recording that\u2019s worth a listen for historical purposes.  Also to appreciate where the band came from.      \u000a**Top Tracks:**  Sloth Loves Chunk, Cable Ready Techno Slut, Killing on Empty    \u000a-**3750** - So by this point the band had really changed their sound.  They went from typical metalcore of the era to a heavier, more mosh-fueled sound.  This is what I like to call the \u201cmoshcore\u201d phase.  However they did mosh unlike any other metalcore band of that ilk from this period.  It was heavier.  It was downtuned lower.  The vocals were pretty much straight up death metal sounding(Not the first band to do this with moshy style core, others had done this, Examples:  Built Upon Frustration, Shattered Realm, Full Blown Chaos).  It was nasty, it was pissed, and just overall full of venom.  It didn\u2019t quite have the more doom/sludge elements that they would later add in, but it could be heard to be forming in their sound.  They had three guitarists at this time.  Each trading off duties.  Though with the chuggy nature of their sound around this time, it was never utilized for more other than making it super goddamn heavy.  The misanthropy in Vincent\u2019s lyrics really was coming out around this time.  But they were a little more obscure and less direct as they would later become.   \u000a**Top Tracks:**  Brown Note, Smoke Ya Later, Sun Poison and Skin Cancer  \u000a-**The Dead Walk** - This is the second album of the \u201cmoshcore\u201d era.  This album was just pure sickness.  Everything about it was dialed up even higher.  They lost a guitarist and got a new drummer.  So they continued on as a five piece.  The sound this album was a lot more punchy and in your face.  Not to mention there was a lot more speed on this one as opposed to some of the plodding sections of 3750.  Make no mistake though, it was still heavy as hell.  Vincent\u2019s lyrics really started to come into their own here.  He was angrier than before and the misanthropy was fully in swing here(\u201cI have given up on you!.\u201d  Brrrr gets me every time.).  Not to mention, some of the atmospheric guitar sections(like those little melodies in the background in their later albums) would develop more here.  For example in \u201cAs If Set Afire\u201d about midway through one can pick out a melancholic bit of guitar work here.  A very nice touch indeed!!!  This is my favorite of this era of The Acacia Strain.  \u000a**Top Tracks:**  As if Set Afire, Whoa! Shut It Down, Predator; Never Prey  \u000a-**Continent** - So, to these ears, this was the first peak of The Acacia Strain.  They were going up the hill.  This album, this fucking album right here.  This was the morass of anger, hatred, and other negative emotions all put together.  This is the a first real mix of the doomier overtones of their later albums, and the hardcore/metalcore of the past three.  The album starts out with \u201cSkynet\u201d that starts out with a slowing to a crawl.  Then it just erupts into a speedier section that sets the tone for the whole album.  This is where the neat ambient additions in the guitar work came in full swing too.  Referencing \u201cSkynet\u201d once again, you hear the dive-bombing of the guitars.  Some wah-peddle work and other neat effects show up.  It just keeps getting better until the end.  The full-on speed assault of \u201cDr.  Doom\u201d almost feels like a thrash song.  Not to mention this album had some neat solos that show up here and there.  By the time the it all starts nearing its end, we end up on \u201cJFC.\u201d  Holy shit.  It just smashes one in the face and never apologizes until it\u2019s all over.  Then the whole thing ends off with the cathartic and pleasant instrumental in \u201cThe Behemoth.\u201d  This album is what I like to call the \u201ctransition\u201d - era.  When the doom was seeping in more into the band.  The next two albums would take full advantage of that.  The only real gripe I ever had with this album was that it had somewhat of a distant recording.  It was clear sounding and all of it can be heard well.  However, it feels as this should have more of an \u201cin-your-face\u201d recording.  \u000a**Top Tracks**:  The whole damn thing.(Especially \u201cBaby Buster\u201d where Ringworm lead man Human Furnace throws in some vox.  Awesome.)  \u000a-**Wormwood** - Cue the \u201cdoom\u201d - era of The Acacia Strain.  So around this time, they came off their peak in \u201cContinent.\u201d  This was not nearly as good as that album, but was still a lot better than a lot of stuff.  I call this the \u201cdoom\u201d - era because they were incorporating a lot more of the doomey/sludgy elements for this one and \u201cDeath is the Only Mortal.\u201d  Immediately when listening to this album, one can make note of the tempo.  About eighty-some percent of the album is crawling at more of a mid-paced tempo.  Another big aspect of this album that seems noticeable, is that there are clear-cut chorus sections.  Not that it was a bad thing, but there were quite a few songs that got a bit repetitive when it came to these chorus sections.  This one and the next album don\u2019t seem to be as well-loved as the bands other work.  The band had a majorly apocalyptic tone going on in this, \u201cContinent\u201d, and \u201cDeath is the Only Mortal\u201d  Either way, there were some catchy, sing-along sections in this particular album(ending of \u201cJonestown\u201d I want to yell it every time.)  Dare I say, this was quite a catchy album to these ears.  \u000aTop tracks:  Jonestown, BTM FDR, Nightman(with awesome cameo from 100 Demons frontman Bruce Lepage.)  \u000a-**Death is the Only Mortal** - This one seems to have not been as well-loved as the rest of The Acacia Strain\u2019s discography.  That mid-tempo crawl that was present on \u201cWormwood\u201d was still present here.  A lot of things that I noticed were said about this one is it was a more boring than their other work.  I disagreed with this.  This album did a better job at being more \u201cdoom-core\u201d-ish than a lot of the downtempo bands that were springing up around the time this was released.  Not to mention, I felt it did way better than \u201cWormwood\u201d on the doomey side of things.  It was dark and cavernous sounding.  The apocalyptic feeling of death everywhere was highly present.  By this point, the ambient guitar work(melodic work in the background) was pretty much a trademark of the band(not saying they started it, but they employed it a lot.).  Songs like \u201cBrain Death\u201d, \u201cVictims of the Cave,\u201d and \u201cDoomblade\u201d showcased just how fed up with the world this band was.  In the earlier work of the band, there was notable anger in what they were playing.  At this point, there is more of a strong disappointment with the world.  That confrontational slant that was abound on \u201cContinent\u201d was gone and in it\u2019s place, a wishing for the end.  A peaceful falling to sleep for humanity.  Still, not the pinnacle of what they have done, but quite good overall.  \u000a**Top Tracks:**  Doomblade, Brain Death, The Mouth of the River(dat beginning, whoa.)   \u000a-**Coma Witch** - Okay, here it is.  To these ears this is the second peak of this band.  Here\u2019s why.  Basically this album is a great marriage of the band of old around 3750/Dead Walk, Continent, and the latter two more doomey albums.  Here\u2019s how, 1.  The production sounds a lot like how \u201cThe Dead Walk\u201d sounded.  Very punchy with a bit of rawness.  They brought back a bit of that speedier hardcore feel they had around that time on this one.  2.  The overall tone of the album.  Now the overall tone of the album feels a lot like \u201cContinent\u201d did.  The hatred is there, along with the pure disappointment with humanity in general.  Now the band has had an overall doom/hateful tone for some time now.  But \u201cContinent\u201d I felt differentiated itself enough to be included in this description.   3.  The doomey-ness of the last few albums is still here.  This kind of goes in line with the tone, but the lyrics on this one have a very foreboding atmosphere to them.  A sense of dread, that we are on our way to extinction.  Also, special note needs to be made of the final song(or additional album if you want to call it that) \u201cObserver.\u201d  They took a cue from the band sleep, and made a long ass song.  A killer song it is!!!!  This one could easily put The Acacia Strain in with sludge bands like Eyehategod, Grief, and others.  Not to mention the samples included in it, that just really drive home the feeling of despair, hatred, disappointment, and overall negativity this album conveys(and I mean that as a compliment.)  To these ears, this peak of this band reaches a little bit higher than their former peak of Continent.  But we\u2019re only talking millimeters here as both are two of the bands best.  \u000a**Top Tracks:**  Observer, the whole damn album.  \u000aSo, this concludes my second guide.  This band has been one of my major favorites for a long time.  I\u2019ve seen them live once and they just plain killed it on stage.  They kill it on their albums too.  Hope this guide is helpful!!!  Have a great day.\u000a

VI've tried searching for a few hours around the Internet for the lyrics for Traitor by Sever The King. Any help is wonderful. 
p744
sVI really like the intensity of this genre, heavy/death/black metal/core etc., but it seems like these genres are saturated by bands with really good lyricists/vocalists and terrible instrumentalists, what do you guys think?
p745
VWhat I mean by "terrible instrumentalists" is that the more songs I listen to, the more I see the same repetitive patterns within the music; really hard guitar riff and drum solo, followed by a lull where the singer belts out a few lines, followed by the same sounds, with areas in between where things might speed up a bit while the vocalist goes screamo-style. \u000a\u000aNow I'm not saying I'm sick of it, I mean I like it as much as the next guy, it's part of what defines the genre, but I feel like there's room for more innovation within the songs. I realize that it'd be unrealistic to expect every track of every band to be an innovative masterpiece where the instrumentalists develop a string of wholly unique sounds, but take out the killer vocals from 90% of the tracks you hear and I'm confident you'll see what I'm talking about. One sound repeated over and over, with little to no progression and only subtle deviations between samples. Are there artists who break the mold, bands whose members really devote themselves to producing unique sounds throughout their songs? \u000a\u000aAn analogue to what I'm talking about would be how "minimalism" style tracks are, and although that ambient sub-genre is worlds apart from what deathcore intends to be, I feel like the concept behind that style of music would be great to see in heavy/death metal. \u000a\u000aBut I digress, what are your thoughts on the topic?
p746
sVSuggestions for songs with a crescendo-like point?

VI'm talking about songs where they just hit a point where shit hits the fan and everything goes batshit insane.

Songs with a really intense, high point! I love these kind of songs and I really want more of them in my playlist. Does anyone of the good people in this subreddit have any suggestions?

sVBeginner's Guide for All Shall Perish(Figured I'd take a crack at making a beginner's guide for the wiki.)
p795
VSo, since anyone could submit a beginner's guide for the wiki here, I figured I'd take my crack at one of my all time top two deathcore bands.  All Shall Perish.  Let me know what you folks think.\u000a\u000a\u000aFirst time I heard about All Shall Perish when Hate, Malice, Revenge dropped in 2003.  It blew my mind.  It was death metal with grooves, and it was so heavy.  They blended in a lot of melodic sections with a few solos.  Not to mention a high/low vocal approach that was just awesome.  That was before I knew anything about deathcore.  I just figured, metalcore was just getting heavier and heavier.  \u000a**Hate.  Malice.  Revenge** - This album was a breakout.  There was a more prominent death metal influence on this one.  Not to mention it seemed to have been a little more mid-paced as opposed to having lots of speed that they would later employ.  Also, there were fewer solos on this album yet it wasn\u2019t hurting for melody.  This album had some killer breakdowns on it.  They almost reminded me a little bit of a more melodic Internal Bleeding.  At the time, I don\u2019t think the term breakdown was being used as much with it.  But it has them in droves.  Good examples would be \u201cSever the Memory\u201d, the ending of \u201cDeconstruction\u201d are killer songs that showcased just how heavy this band can be.  Definitely a killer album that got quite a few spins from me when I got it.    \u000a**Top Tracks:**  Laid to Rest, Sever the Memory, Deconstruction  \u000a**The Price of Existence** - Damn, just damn.  This band went from a murky/groovy death metal band to full on deathcore.  This one was anticipated, but I don\u2019t think anyone could bet on how good this album would be.  They lost their other vocalist and this is when Eddie Hermida joined.  This album was damn near perfect.  It starts right out of the gate with \u201cEradication\u201d and just gets crazier from there.  This one had it all.  Frenetic pacing.  Awesome guitar solos.  Melodies.  Devastating breakdowns(All about that breakdown in \u201cThe True Beast.\u201d)  Eddie Hermida just crushed the vocal performance.  His highs were painful but awesome.  His lows were pretty damn sickening.  He even threw in a few brees(but thankfully kept them in check.)  To this day I don\u2019t think they ever really topped this album.  \u000a**Top Tracks:**  Tough choice, \u201cThe Day of Justice,\u201d \u201cThe True Beast,\u201d and \u201cThere is No Business to be Done on a Dead Planet.\u201d  But really, the whole damn thing was just amazing.  \u000a**Awaken the Dreamers** - So this album was a dividing force amongst the fans.  From my observations, some loved it, and some hated it.  I was in the liked it camp.  It was not nearly as good as \u201cThe Price of Existence,\u201d however, All Shall Perish firing on half its cylinders is still quite a bit ahead of many other deathcore bands.  They decided to inject even more melody into this album, and experiment more on it.  Incorporating a few clean sections(not really that clean, just shouted-style singing.) and then there was \u201cMemories of a Glass Sanctuary.\u201d  Which I don\u2019t see too much bad about that song, it just really slows the momentum of the album compared to the rest of the songs.  They still contained the frenetic, and fast songs(\u201cStabbing to Purge Dissimulation\u201d and \u201cWhen Life Meant More\u2026\u201d)  However they threw in a couple mid-paced songs(\u201cNever Again\u201d and \u201cGagged, Bound, Shelved, and Forgotten\u201d)  All in all what made this album not nearly as good as their previous album was the uneven pacing.  Whereas \u201cThe Price of Existence\u201d was full speed ahead like a tricked up muscle car, \u201cAwaken the Dreamers\u201d felt like a sixteen year old trying to learn manual in a Civic.  Not their best, but still not horrible.  \u000a**Top Tracks:**  When Life Meant More\u2026\u2026., Stabbing To Purge Dissimulation  \u000a**This is Where It Ends** - Well now, this was more like it.  They revisited and brought back most of their main sound from \u201cThe Price of Existence.\u201d  That album is such a yardstick by which the rest of their discography is compared.  The frenetic pace was back all the way through.  They brought back the really sick breakdowns that just come out of no where.  You don\u2019t expect them, but when they hit, they hit really hard.  The melody was still there, only they stopped messing around with clean sections and incorporated it back into the riffs and guitar solos.  It felt like home again.  Except for one big issue that still puts it few steps behind.  It was so damn loooonnnggg!!!  That was my main beef with this album. It\u2019s good, but you have to really clear an afternoon for it.  Clocking in at 57 some minutes, the songs on this one tend to drag a bit, almost meander.  Some of the best songs are the shortest.  \u201cDivine Illusion, \u201cEmbrace the Curse(all about that breakdown midway through.)\u201d, and \u201cThe Death Plague\u201d were some of the sickest they had written since their earlier days.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good album, they just could have chopped some time off it.  It was a great note to go out on. Then Eddie left, and all was darkness.  Either way it was still an awesome album.  That and the only long song of this album to be truly epic though is \u201cA Pure Evil.\u201d  It totally reminded me of \u201cThe True Beast.\u201d  Almost like it could be a sequel.  \u000a**Top Tracks:**  Divine Illusion, The Death Plague, Embrace the Curse, A Pure Evil.\u000a

Fuuuuuuuckkkk, that album is metal. \u000a\u000aAnywho, I want deathcore in that style. Melodic metal is my favorite type, with lots of harmonies. With lots of chugging but with melody, not just straight chugging. The song "In Dying Days" is a good example of what I'm talking about. \u000a\u000aSo, think you can help a fellow metal head out?

Afterwards, while discussing the show with my friends I got to thinking about which show out of all that I've been to that I enjoyed the most.\u000aPersonally, I would have to say that a show that I went to a couple of years ago with Impending Doom, August Burns Red and My Child My Bride was my favorite, so what's your's Reddit?

sVSuggestions? (fast deathcore with good riffs)
p1018
VI've been into deathcore for a while now, and I'm finding my favourite style of it is the really fast kind (as opposed to like Black Tongue) with strong riffs. Stuff like Suicide Silence on their first two albums, Lorna Shore, Infant Annihilator, After The Burial, Thy Art Is Murder, Betraying The Martyrs, Elysia, Salt The Wound, Carnifex, etc. Bands similar to this would be appreciated, thanks.

sVWhy all the hatred on certain bands?
p1059
VI don't stop here much or even visit this page very often. When I do, I only search for certain songs to see if people are suggesting other bands or feedback about the current song.\u000a\u000aI was looking into some Emmure (yes i said it) material a few minutes ago. All I saw was extreme hatred and complete disgust towards Emmure's music and fans. Majority of the comments were people talking about the band member's life or statements outside their music. \u000a\u000aHow does that have anything to do with their music?  \u000a\u000aWhen I'm listening to music, I couldn't give two shits if it was Bin Laden singing or Elvis Presley, the music is the only thing that matters to me. Anyhow, it just irks me that people see the word Emmure in a title, and instantly downvote and write "omg frankie is such a cunt! does anyone hate emmure like me??? giv me upvotes".  You can probably quote me on that too. \u000a\u000aSo, for my last question, Is this subreddit a place to discover new deathcore music or a place that defines the only good deathcore music that true deathcore fans are allowed to listen too? Emmure may have shit lyrics, shit tabs, shit sound, shit band, or whatever else the fuck you think. They are deathcore though, so instead of commenting on how much you hate them, maybe suggest better bands that sound would appeal to the crowd who listens to Emmure so we can start listening to "better" music.

Anything you guys could suggest would be sick. thanks

sVI need recommendations
p1106
VI'm signing up for a talent show, and I want to play a deathcore song. The problem is, the songs I want to play are either 50-75% breakdown (i.e. Emmure) or way too technical (i.e. Rings of Saturn). Can someone recommend me a song/band that isn't too chuggy or technical? I also prefer the song to be played on a 6-string, but 7- or 8-string songs will be fine
