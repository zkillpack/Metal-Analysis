p100
aVNope. 
p101
aVAwesome!! Tell me about the electronics you're using.
p102
aVWell, we recorded it all through a bunch of shitty mics. My buddy who plays guitar uses a phaser and aquapuss. I play bass and I use a modded DoD grunge pedal and a sansamp. 
p103
aVOh maybe that's the phaser I hear between tracks? I thought it was a synth.
p104
aVYeah dude, it is. We take influence from bands like Full Of Hell when it comes to pedal effects. 
p105
aVI'll check them out, I'm old and don't keep up much...
p106
aVSkip to 1:30 my dude. \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPLGsWXleCg

aVI'm a big fan of the [Sea of Shit/Water Torture](http://grindcorekaraoke.com/album/diseased-audio-006) split. Probably my favorite WT release, but all their recordings are great, as are Sea of Shit's.

asVr/powerviolence, is there such thing as black metal influenced pv? could you help me find the closest thing to it?
p130
(lp131
VI too am very interested in this
p132
aVAgreed, you should let us know if you run into something in the future. \u000a
p133
aVWill do! Have you heard The Secret? Not powerviolence, but blackened, hardcore-tinged grind. Probably the closest thing that I can think of. 
p134
aVtry this: http://www.reverbnation.com/impressionableyouth
p135
aVI don't know if they have anything online, but look out for COKSKAR. total rippers. guitarist plays in a band called FALSE. both are from Minneapolis. 
p136
aVhttp://cokskar.bandcamp.com/ &lt;They are awesome.  \u000aEdit: &amp; I found some False from Wisconsin here: http://gileadmedia.bandcamp.com/album/untitled-2
p137
aVnah man, they're from mpls.
p138
aVWord. I must've read the wrong tab.
p139
aVCokskar and False are both sick.  I saw Cokskar for the first time at the Iron Lung show in Minneapolis last month, they sound way better live than on their recordings.
p140
aVis it scorpion or Jimmy? 
p141
aVskorpiain. 
p142
aVis that his real name?!\u000a\u000aI'm more so friends with the dudes in in defence but False stayed at my house when they there on tour with Thou. All righteous dudes and dudette. Also, siiiiiiiiiiick drummer. I want that guy to play in a p/v band.
p143
aVSkorpiain is not his real name, but he commonly goes by it, yes.  I totally agree that the drummer of False should be in a pv band.  Dude is unrelenting.
p144
aVCheck out Ramlord: http://ramlord.bandcamp.com/  \u000a
p145
aVRamlord is sick! That's the first band that came to mind.
p146
aVGood looking out. Someone from Ramlord is playing in another band called Cross Rot up here in Anchorage on Friday. Ima go check it out.
p147
aVBrian played bass/vocals on Stench of Fallacy, Condensed Flesh split and the Cara Neir split and is no longer in Ramlord... but an awesome dude and cross rot is also an awesome new band that you should definitely check out.
p148
aVWord. Saw Cross Rot, wasn't impressed honestly. 
p149
aVYou're looking for California Love, a widely looked over Powerviolence band. Their album Reaping the Whirlwind is hands down one of my favorite. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4jVB0UtafU
p150
aVDesphosphorus, Young And In The Way
p151
aVCheck out [Torch Runner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euQXwa2OLOk), as well as the aforementioned Young and in the Way.  Two great bands out of North Carolina.
p152
aVClosest thing I can think of is [Sump](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdXZMOkNujs) .
p153
aVI would say Sexdrome is a pretty good bet, i would say closer to BM influenced hardcore, but they fucking rip\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAhqJwAL_t4\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA73YwDji_M

p156
aVI play in a blackened grind band called Lesser Life\u000a\u000awww.lesserxlife.bandcamp.com\u000a\u000aOther bands to check out are Nails, Young and in the Way, and Votnut. Those bands are more hardcore influenced than PV influenced. I love it, I feel like the bleakness of black metal really gives hardcore and extra punch.
p157
aVvotnut is so heavy and evil
p158
aVI love it man
p159
aVYou guys are gnarly as fuck.
p160

p808
aVGreat fucking score, man.\u000a
p809
aVNot a band that's around anymore, but Pisspoor from Austin, TX immediately came to mind.  They were around in the mid-90s and had a split 7" (with Yokel) and a split LP (with Ungrateful.....on Sound Pollution Records).\u000a\u000aSaw them once at ABC No Rio in NYC and they were pretty great.  Their singer, Cathy, was as nice and sweet as could be....but once she was on the mic, the bowels of hell emerged.\u000a\u000aFound their side of the split LP on YouTube:  http://youtu.be/oC1IhHnayd8\u000a\u000aAnother band that comes to mind was Coleman....who I think were from Massachusetts, but I wouldn't swear to it.  Saw them once too.  They were a trio without a bass player.  They had a 7" and a split LP with Three Studies for a Crucifixion.\u000a\u000aFound a song from the split LP...not really sure they were really power-violence in retrospect...more of that mid-90s screamo stuff....but they were pretty cool so you might dig it anyway.\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/e3U-IXc3p1k\u000a\u000a

aV&gt;On July 1, 1991, Infest recorded a live set for the Los Angeles radio station KXLU. This session was later released by Deep Six Records who also released the No Man's Slave LP. The vocals on No Man's Slave were recorded post-breakup in 2000 and the LP was released later in 2002.\u000a\u000aPersonally I've always felt a bit mixed about this LP because of this.

p924
aVReminds me of some of the newer bands on Southern Lord's lineup.  Good shit.
p925
aVThey're on A389 Records run by Dom Romeo(guitarist for Pulling Teeth(since disbanded)). They're super nice dudes. Their facebook page is run completely by them, I messaged them a couple of times and received answers back within the day. I haven't been able to see them live because they're always somewhere else or in Europe barely in the West Coast but they'll be back. 
p926
aVI've seen them twice. Do not miss them next time they come around
p927
aVI wouldn't have missed them if I got into hardcore earlier. I literally just became a hardcore and powerviolence kid over a month. I got tired of the nerdery of the metal scene(I'm more metal than you attitude), hardcore was more open minded and fit more with my lifestyle (straight edge, positive). Powerviolence I came to be introduced through hardcore, I had an inkling of that before with grindcore bands like Insect Warfare, Discordance Axis and PxDx and Anb but that was it. I barely listen to metal now except for treasured old school DM releases and occasional tech death.
p928
aVI just got this split in the mail the other day, and it's been fucking glued to my turntable. Full of Hell is crazy good- but don't forget about Code Orange Kids. I've known these dudes for years and they've been making solid music since the beginning. Check out the video for the song "V" (also on the split with FOH), it's real fucking tight.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siIdEicG-Ro&amp;list=PL995BB38D72C7D8FE&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plpp_video

VSounds good.
p966
aVMy gods, the compression sounds like ass. The music is well written, but whoever mastered the music is retarded, and doesn't know how to use compression. The drums sound terrible, and the guitars are too muddy, which is odd considering how gainy and mid-focused they are.  It's like they threw the entire album through a heavy compressor after it was mixed, instead of compressing individual instruments as needed.  Total production abuse. Another example of digital trash ruining great music.
p967
aVI don't ever master anything I do because I don't have the tools or money to do so. So next time I record an album, I'll happily send it to you if you want to mix and master it.

Pretty much a compilation of a lot of their split/single stuff and quite awesome.\u000a\u000aAlso, if you like that, check out later Bastard Noise.  Early BN is a power electronics band but later out it ended up sounding exactly like MITB.
p1705
aVTheir split with Crossed Out is what got me into them, and it continues to be my favorite release of theirs. I feel like it's a pretty good representation of what they did; incredibly brutal pv mixed with some incredibly brutal soundscapes. \u000a\u000aZeroThePenguin is right about the DIYCD (as it includes the crossed out split).

aVI've been in the hardcore scene for more than a decade, although only REALLY getting into PV and dbeat the past 5.

p2171
(lp2172
VIt's cheaper for the bands involved than a full solo release, requires fewer songs (and when your average song length is 15 seconds, this helps), and probably best of all it allows people to discover new bands.  Buy a split because I love Band A, then discover that I also now love Band B.

p2176
aVI totally hear you.  I've been listening to it for probably over a decade and it's just annoying.  Especially when you're poor.  1000x worse with noise, though.  Only genre of music with more releases a year than people into it.  How the hell a person puts out 4-6 tapes/CDr's each year is beyond me.  Anyhow, I finally gave up on trying to get everything Water Torture's put out and traded in all my 7"s of theirs to a store yesterday.  Thankfully it's a store that gives good credit, so I made out well.\u000a\u000aBtw this is one of the reasons that a lot of bands eventually put out compilations of their releases on LP or CD.

aVmulti tracking in my shed. drums-guitar-bass-vocals in that order

aVThis is pretty cool, but I'm not digging the guitar/bass tones.\u000a\u000aI like it though.
p2209
aVThanks man. Any suggestions? I'm recording again soon and it will be more noise-influenced stuff. I haven't been doing this long so it should only get better
p2210
aVIf you don't have a tube amp, get a tube amp. Then get a RAT distortion pedal. And turn it way up. For bass, I like Sunn heads with like a tube screamer or something in front of it. Think Paint It Black's bass tone.\u000a\u000aKeep it up man. Where are you from?
p2211
aVI only have a Fender 212r. I CAN borrow my friends RAT pedal but, it sounds rad. I wish I had money for all that good equipment haha. I'm from Queensland, Australia.
p2212
aVDude, craigslist. Just keep an eye out and trade up every once in a while. It'll take you a few years but you can get an amazing rig for really cheap. It took me forever to get all my gear but it was so worth it. If you're on a budget my main advice would be to stay far far away from Marshall amps. Get a nice, used Peavey head. 5150's usually go for really cheap, and if you're super duper vigilant you can get your hands on a Butcher. Both great for the type of music you want to play, even without a pedal in front. Also, you can get boss DS-1's for like 20 bucks used. Definitely worth looking into.
p2213
aVThanks for the advice dood. I'm all about that. I found my old drums/really good bass rig (now broken by a 'friend') by looking in trading posts etc. I should have another song up by the end of the week which is more lo-fi/noise influenced so keep an eye out and see what you think.

p2271
(lp2272
VI just listened.  I really liked it.  Was it improvised or did you write the songs before recording?  Sounded pre-written, but ya never know.  You should re-record them.\u000a\u000aGet some headphone for the drummer, and play a guitar in his ears as he records drum tracks.  [Buy one of these and plug your guitar directly into your computer's mic input](http://i.imgur.com/cayt8.jpg), then record two (or four) guitar tracks for each song, playing the exact same thing for each guitar track.  Then pan them about 50%, one to the left, one to the right.  Then record a bass track, same method, no panning.  Logic can dictate the rest (mixing/mastering), because only you know how you want your music to sound.  You can use the same gear you used to record this demo and it will sound amazing, I assure you.  Tip for when mastering, remove *all* the low end from your guitar tracks.  You do not need bass tones in the guitars at all if you have a bass to play!  Drum mic tip: [if you only use one mic, do](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxcufuj-OCE) this.  Almost any mic will work, even shitty cheap computer mics sound good for punk demos.  Better than some of the 4 track demos we used to hear, anyway!\u000a\u000aThis music is worth re-recording, guys.  I really liked it.

aVit sounds like the drummer isnt using the bass drum in the blasts(?) which makes it sound odd to me, he hits it like every 8 snare hits or something? if you cant do it with one foot get a double kick and cheat :)
p2307
aVHaha, I'm actually the drummer and singer.  It's just me and my friend, he plays guitar live.  When we record we just kind of switch off on whatever we want to play, ha.  But yeah, I don't hit the bass drum as much.  I try to give the fast parts a little less bass drum because I think it sounds cooler to just kick super hard whenever a guitar riff changes or something.  Regardless, thanks for the feedback, dude.  I sincerely appreciate it.\u000a\u000aAnd big ups to you two for not being dicks.  That rules.
p2308
aVah alright cool man. yea i mean i normally just blast by playing faster than the standard punk/hc 'fast' beat so i kick for every snare as you would normally, just faster, but heck, if thats how you like playing then play away! shame you are american, otherwise i would try to catch a show, but its a little far for me

aVNice!
p2582
aVThis band refused to play a show because a gay guy used the word faggot in an improv doom metal band. I paid 8 bucks to see 2 local bands because instead of confronting whatever the hell offended them they packed up and left and got mad at all the people who came out to see them. If you want to make a political statement, make one, don't ruin everyone's night.
p2583
aVthe details you provided aren't very illuminating. just cause you're gay doesn't give you free reign to use the word faggot in anyway you want: self-reference, cool, calling an audience member faggot, not cool. For some reason I seriously doubt that the incident alone caused them to leave.
p2584
aVContext, the line was "Jesus was a faggot".  I think they used that as a sort of excuse to get out of there, as the show was in a remote location and many bands don't realize just how far it can be between cities up there, so when you arrive later than you hoped to a dingy bar with only a few people, it can be disappointing.  I, the singer in question, was in highschool at the time.  I think their other problem was class based.  The venue was not full of the sort of College-Anarchos that they were initially used to seeing, but rather non-radical, working class, children and young adults, in one of the roughest parts of the roughest cities in the country.\u000a\u000aAnd they were tourmated with another band "Lab Rat" who was playing similar stuff with a more vegan slant.  It's no known if it is lab rat or rape revenge who pulled the plug on the gig, but once the bus is leaving, the bus is leaving.\u000a\u000aIn the letter exchange that ensued between LR, RR, and the doom band, the doom band's guitar player was told he was white, while he was native, in a sort of low-level vulgar-anarchist strategy to negate his opinion on social justice issues.  It was particularly disappointing as I was indeed a Goldman-esque anarcho-feminist at the time, and was really excited to meet these people.\u000a\u000aNo one from the doom band harbours any resentment, we are no longer active, and we understand that even the most "enlightened" people can become uncomfortable when on the road, surrounded by folks from a lower socio-economic class, who haven't had anarchist non-oppression training by the nature of them being brought up in a practically segregated city with no working class movement or even much queer liberation, and being between 15-18 years old.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I think the "silly" nature of our music did not contextualize the line properly in a way that if it were a beat poem or piano ballad, it might have.  Improvisational doom, even compared to PV bands can be seen as unprofessional.  This event has largely spurred my study of theology and musicology.
p2585
aVYou seem to be making a lot of assumptions in regards to how comfortable the band is around working class people. I heard a similar argument when I went to see Punch and the lead singer criticized people for smoking cigarettes in the venue: but these weren't people from a cyclical institutionalized poverty but rather white hipster punks with college degrees. If it was, in your words, "a dingy bar with only a few people," that probably had a lot more to do with it. I would need the full context to judge the whole "you're white!" issue, but it is a problem amongst white radicals so I wouldn't be too surprised and that is pretty disappointing. Conversely from the impressions I've had of Rape Revenge I think they have experience with all the things that you claim they do not.\u000a\u000aAnd I'd probably be pissed about that line too. It sounds like something a stupid 13 year old "satanist" would say. Though I would've just told you to your face.
p2586
aVMaybe they gained that experience over the course of the last three years?  Their music has developed at a rate that would suggest that, perhaps their personal experience has.  I dunno.  I did watch them uncomfortable shuffle about at their merch table for hours and hours before and during the show, totally Rockstar and not meet any of the kids.  They only met with any other BANDS after they had decided to leave and they were all but begged to play by another local bass player.  They gave him an 8 inch, however.  If I remember correctly, the band that was coerced into leaving gave the 8 inch.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, a similar grindy touring band, The Young Tongues were there the whole time, watched the whole thing, commented on it during their set, and of course, because they weren't actually touring WITH the other bands, stayed and played.\u000a\u000aMy assumption about their comfort level only comes from watching hundreds of other bands react to the same situation.  Our geographical location forces all cross canada touring bands to stop by virtue of distance.  The more proletarian/libertine/open-minded bands act one way, and the bougie bands act a different one, with almost no bands behaving in the middle, or behaving differently.
p2587
aVI like to consider myself a pretty PC guy, it wasn't directed at anyone it was in a REALLY really shitty song that was made up on the spot. They were trying to make a point because they played with a band that they thought had nothing in common politically with them, but really we all went to the show to see them.\u000a\u000aI don't disagree with their message, I'm just saying that they were really mean.\u000a\u000a\u000aAs an aside from a songwriting perspective, these are some of the lamest lyrics ever written.\u000a\u000ahttp://loudsongs.com/r/rape-revenge/self-titled/show-all-songs
p2588
aV&gt; stop using the word cunt as an insult\u000a\u000aheh
p2589
aVYou have free reign to use faggot in any way you want in the states, gay or not. Regardless of your agreement with the manner of expression, it is protected. The mature thing to do would be to confront the perceived misuse and discuss it as adults.\u000a\u000aI agree there needs to be more to the story, but there'd have to be a LOT more to the story to justify shitting all over people who came to see your show because of something one of the other bands' members said.
p2590
aV&gt;it is protected\u000a\u000aso you're saying punk bands should be respecting the law?
p2591
aV&gt;just cause you're gay doesn't give you free reign to use the word faggot\u000a\u000aA lot more than fuzzytoe's internet decree, yes. You don't dictate what people can and can't say, and you can in fact go around saying 'faggot' as much as you like in whatever context you choose.\u000a\u000aIf punk bands of all people aren't respecting the first amendment, then punk has become a fascist bullshit hypocrisy.
p2592
aVThis band along with a pretty large majority of punks are not American constitutionalists. They're anarchists. Anarchists tend not to recognize various legal systems. For an anarchist or radical to be opposed to the use of offensive words doesn't make them a hypocrite as they don't adhere to your set of laws.\u000a\u000aYou have a lot to learn about punk, buddy. 
p2593
aVAnarchy is more about freedom than it is about eschewing laws simply because they are laws. To spit in the face of freedom in the name of freedom is hypocrisy.\u000a\u000aYou have a lot to learn about ideals, buddy.
p2594
aVAt no point did I say freedom of speech isn't important. I said to expect anarchist and punks to uphold the 1st amendment is just silly. Freedom of speech and freedom in general exist outside of the Constitution. This doesn't mean people shouldn't be allowed to react to what they consider offensive or that people shouldn't in some way be held accountable for hate speech. \u000a\u000aI'm not saying the artist in question was committing hate speech or even meant it in an offensive way. You just can't expect everyone to sit there and deal with what in there eyes is offensive. I feel for the people who went to go see them and got fucked over but I also understand not wanting to deal with someone who had pissed you off. To say that is fascist and hypocritical is just ridiculous. 
p2595
aVfirst amendment? you're one of those rock the vote types aren't you? People can say whatever they want but don't be a wimp when the people that slur is used against peace out/get pissed/kick your bigoted ass. Fascist bullshit hypocrisy lol the first amendment protects fascism in this country.

The drummer was in Self Inflicted and a few short lived grind bands up here in the bay, and the guitar player is a young guy and plays in Paranoid Freakout.

aVNo one has said Despise You, but shit like Ceremony is apparently essential powerviolence now. Get Westside Horizons, No Comment - Downsided, the Crossed Out Discography and the Reality and Blleeaauurrggh compilations.
p2940
aVI never understand why there's this whole tr00 powerviolence attitude towards Ceremony. Up until Rohnert Park they were a great punk band and VV is a straight up fast and meaty PV album. They suck now, but live and on record they used to be one of the best.
p2941
aVI don't want to type a big rant because I'm pretty busy right now, but my objection is really with the odd use of the term rather than not liking Ceremony or defending some elite league of old bands.\u000a\u000aAndrew Nolan has written a much better piece about this than I will:\u000ahttp://survivalist-deathcult.blogspot.com/2011/01/2010-part-3-problem-with-power-violence.html

aVThis Comp Kills Fascists Vol. 1 and 2 isn't exactly essential, but it's such a sick compilation! There are a lot of iconic powerviolence and grindcore bands as well as some lesser known ones. Some more notable bands on the comp are Weekend Nachos, Insect Warfare, Magrudergrind, A.S.R.A., and Hummingbird of Death. Mind you that all of these songs are exclusive to this comp, so it's not like they ripped'em off of other albums.

Also, they JUST played a show with Loma Prieta in Cali not even a week ago.\u000a\u000aThe reason for their inactivity is that Justin (guitar/vocals) also plays in Dangers, and they trade off summers for tour. For example, one summer Graf will tour, the next Dangers will, and so on. Also, the drummer, Alan, is in law school still I believe\u000a\u000aEdit#1: Found the event page for that show Graf just played with Loma https://www.facebook.com/events/540089736085608/\u000a\u000aEdit#2: If you go to the Graf Orlock band page on the Vitriol records website, you can see in their discography listing that they have a LP due out soon http://vitriolrecords.com/bands/graf-orlock

aVWould you mind describing the difference?
p3205
aVPowerviolence has gruffer, deeper (read: not screamy) vocals, generally more negative lyrical content, and tends to be devoid of any sort of "spacey" guitar effects or mellow parts to a song.  It's the pairing of fast songs with sludgy guitar feel.\u000a\u000aOrchid was a product of Western Mass intelligentsia punx.  They went to Hampshire and Amherst, studying postmodern critical theory and applied that to their music and lyrics.  Infest and Spazz probably didn't sit around reading Derrida and Foucault and ruminating on the contemporary social condition of man and if they did, it wasn't an influence on their music.  Powerviolence hates fucking everything.
p3206
aVok.  thanks for the response!

aVOrchid's later stuff is definitely closer, especially with more grindy guitar work but I wouldn't call them pv\u000a\u000aedit: like the [split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSIzeiMs5m4) with pig destroyer

aVI always considered Orchid an early skramz band, much like Saetia

aVi'll second [coke bust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMwFIuxxug) and [infest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvNrdKt1MI0), essential powerviolence in my mind. [iron lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxSixWN8dOE) is quite good, and incorporates a lot of grind as well. if you want bands that blend pv with grind/death, i'd definitely suggest getting into deathgrind, even if you aren't typically a metal head. [assück](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76aoxbmphyY) is the first band that springs to mind, they're probably my favorite deathgrind band ever... if you want something a tad more experimental or "weird," check out [loma prieta's side of their split with raein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqQsftGefDI) (the rest of their discography is hit or miss, but "iv" is one of my favorite hardcore records), anything from [man is the bastard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYZDSelgqJY) (extremely groovy noisegrind), or [bucket full of teeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHI96OCms2k) (fuck if i know, i'm not a huge fan of these guys but they are definitely the most "out there" pv/grind band i've heard).
p3223
aVAlthough Loma is an amazing band they are not really PV.\u000a\u000aThey are pretty much straight screamo 
p3224
aVi see where you're coming from, but i'd put them somewhere in the murky area between grind and early screamo. they use a ton of blasts/tempo (especially on the split with raein) shifts which i think make a for a pretty PV/grind-influenced screamo sound.

aVInfest like everyone's saying is definite. You should check out Wormrot they're a pretty great grindcore band. Also Nasum.
p3231
aVIn Disgust. "Reality Choke" is one of my favourite albums EVER. It's like powerviolence with a good splash of grindcore in it. The vocalist sounds like he could be singing for Job For A Cowboy or Suffocation.\u000a\u000aAlso, if you happen to like Cave State, be sure to check out Scapegoat, (they are total Crossed Out worship), Fissure and Abuse.
