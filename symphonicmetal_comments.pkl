aV[I called it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/1wn54s/epicas_latest_hint_about_the_new_album_title_fill/cf3k6pj)\u000a\u000aHonestly, it was the only possible thing at that point.
p11
aVI now have you tagged as Epica psychic.
p12
aVUgh. The only thing I don't like about Epica is their Chopra-style quantum woo. 
p13
aVI know what you mean. It sometimes works, but as someone else had said, lyrics about science don't always work well with the grandeur that Symphonic Metal usually gives.
p14
aVI love Epica but some of the lyrics from "Kingdom of Heaven" really make me cringe.  Please don't screw this up.
p15
asVI don't consider myself a singer but I did this Kamelot vocal cover a while back. What do you guys think?
p16
(lp17
VNice job! On a technical note, the first verse sounded a bit nasal (Not sure if that's your goal), but you may want to move your resonance away from the mask. Other than that, nice job.
p18
aVthank you! 
p19
aVFar better than I could muster up. Props man!

p23
asVWithin Temptation's new album confirmed to be named 'Hydra', released on Jan 31st
p24
(lp25
VI'm thrilled to see Lana Del Rey and Imagine Dragons covers on there, as I love the particular songs being covered. I'm really excited! 
p26
aVNot gonna lie, I didn't read the article until I saw your comment. Then I had to go see which Imagine Dragons song they were covering. \u000a\u000aI'm cautiously excited for this one. Like someone said about too many covers can make an album seem disjointed. 
p27
aVYou know you can listen to WT's Q-Music cover of Radioactive on YouTube? Do you think it will be different on the album?\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKDxvVom64c\u000a\u000aI heard the WT cover before the actual song and like it a lot more that the original.
p28
aVAll the covers were already available on [this CD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Q-Sessions-Within-Temptation/dp/B00C3TCBFS/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384001220&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr1&amp;keywords=within+temptation+q+music+covers), I'd say they sound slightly better than the YouTube ones which were mostly taken from when the songs were on the radio. I'm sure it will be the same version on the album.
p29
aV&gt; "Within Temptation collaborated with several special guests on \u2018Hydra\u2019: Tarja Turunen,"\u000a\u000aawesome!\u000a\u000a&gt;"Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum and metalcore hero Howard Jones, formerly of Killswitch Engage"\u000a\u000acool\u000a\u000a&gt; "as well as US hip-hop icon Xzibit."\u000a\u000awat\u000a\u000aAlso, four tracks are just covers? Didn't have enough time to make your own songs? The album is looking quite weird for me, so many colabs and covers.
p30
aV&gt;Also, four tracks are just covers? Didn't have enough time to make your own songs?\u000a\u000aThere are 19 tracks on the album...\u000a\u000aAlso the collabs are very common, Delain, Camelot and Nemesea just to name a few off my head regularly have multiple songs with collabs on an album, but still perform them live on their own or with the collab artist for special events.
p31
aVI know they are common, I just personally don't like when they are very frequent. I didn't like Delain's first album because of this, for me it felt disjointed.
p32
aV[deleted]
p33
aVThe first 10 tracks are the proper album, the following ones (the covers and demo versions) are bonus tracks only available on the special digital version.
p34
aVOh, I understood that only the demo versions are bonus.
p35
aVGot confirmation from the band here: http://25.media.tumblr.com/d1a0cff45194e8e7acbae71f7545b8f8/tumblr_mvyg5rSQaw1svsnxjo1_500.png

p37
aVCan't wait! I've never pre-ordered something so fast in my life, lol.
p38
aVI am really, really frustrated to hear that Xzibit will be featured on Hydra. I feel totally alienated. I listen to WT because I like metal and symphonic metal. I am trying to get *away* from the onslaught of crap in American music!\u000a\u000aI am all for experimenting and pushing boundaries, but it's really painful to see a band you love throw its fans in the dumpster. WT was a unique and interesting band, but between The Unforgiving, the Q-Music covers, and Hydra, they're moving way too close to bland pop-rock.
p39
aV&gt;I am trying to get away from the onslaught of crap in American music!\u000a\u000aYou realize that Kamelot is American, right?
p40
aVHa, yeah, there are exceptions.
p41
aVApart from maybe the lead singles of The Unforgiving I don't think much of it sounded like bland pop-rock. Iron, In The Middle of the Night, A Demon's Fate are all epic, fairly heavy and unique songs. The ballads on it are beautiful as well. And you haven't even heard Hydra yet!

p61
(lp62
VI'm looking forward to this, but I feel a bit weird about listening to demos before the actual songs! I guess I could just buy it and not listen to them...
p63
aVMuch as i like their work, 21 seconds tells us nothing about the EP.

asVPreviews of the picture discs for Endless Forms Most Beautiful
p65
(lp66
VYou can see the titles for the 5 parts of *The Greatest Show On Earth*:\u000a\u000a1. Four Point Six\u000a2. Life \u000a3. The Toolmaker\u000a4. The Understanding\u000a5. Sea-Worn Driftwood\u000a\u000a(4.6 is roughly the age of the Earth in billions of years.)
p67
aVI think the bottom left is supposed to be illustrating *Edema Ruh*. That's what I would picture a trouper's camp looking like. Although, it can be argued that you could see two more titles in it: *Alpenglow* for the red glow on the mountains and *My Walden* for living in nature (the latter is probably a more loose fit).
p68
aVI thought Edema Ruh too - I haven't read the Kingkiller books yet but since the Edema Ruh seem to be wandering minstrels it would explain the caravans and instruments.\u000a\u000aBut it also wouldn't surprise me if it referenced other songs. Like how the artwork used for Rest Calm demo was clearly depicting the "a kite above a graveyard grey" line from Turn Loose The Mermaids.
p69
asVOpinions on Amaranthe?
p70
(lp71
VLove em, catchy and poppy and heavy and I just don't know why but I love em
p72
aVCatchy, poppy and heavy are the reasons why I love them.
p73
aVPretty good. I consider it some pop with metal influence (as opposed to the other way around). I listened to them pretty frequently for about a week. It's catchy and entertaining. I saw them open for Within Temptation and there is definitely some studio polish and their stage presence can improve (clean vocalist seemed bored and didn't know what to do when he wasn't singing), but that's not unexpected for a fairly young band.\u000a\u000a[Here's someone else's video from the show I saw.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpr8PzaZmKw)\u000a\u000aUltimately, it comes down to what you like. My Spotify playlists are full of 'guilty pleasures'.
p74
aVI was at that show!  I agree with you that the singers could do better on stage (aimless wandering is a bit distracting) but I was otherwise impressed that they sounded close enough to their album sound that the catchiness didn't get lost.  I was excited to hear both bands there that night and I'm glad they were able to provide a good opening.
p75
aVRight on. Small world. I'm in Seattle and flew down to LA to catch the show. It was pretty good. We're getting screwed by Nightwish/Delain next year, but I'll probably catch the BC and/or Portland shows. 
p76
aVI listen to them quite frequently and they did a pretty good live show when I saw them a couple months ago.
p77
aVEh, they're fun, but not what I can really sit down and listen too
p78
aVNot amazing, but damn if I don't love to dance to Electroheart. 
p79
aVHave to agree with this ^
p80
aVI like them, with the rage voice. It balances out the pop-influences of the  lead singer vocals imo.
p81
aVMaybe it's because I like pop music too but I really enjoy them. They're catchy and fun while being heavy and I enjoy that. I'm going to see them in March. \u000a\u000aI really like that they don't take themselves too seriously. It's a breath of fresh air in the metal genre.
p82
aVAmaranthe are one of the bands that I pick and choose songs from. Some like Within Temptation or Delain have really solid albums with some songs that just rise above the rest. Amaranthe have some amazing songs that balance out the rest of the album it seems. Overall, I enjoy listening to them and look forward to hearing their future releases.
p83
aVThey're fun as a kind of lighter (less dark and heavy sound/lyrics) band. I really enjoyed their live performance in Montreal, they had great energy and really seemed to be enjoying themselves, while delivering good quality.  \u000aI find some of their songs a bit too catchy/pop for my taste, but several of theirs are pretty awesome!
p84
aVI think they're a fun band with some talent but lacking in the songwriting department. Songs are catchy, but shockingly unmemorable.  \u000aElize has a really good voice with lots of range, but both the male vocalists are hilarious bad. Henrik is ok with his harsh vocals but they're very monotonous. Jake, who is advertised as the band's power metal vocalist, has an outstanding absence of any power behind his voice and sounds like he's struggling. \u000a
p85
aVI like them. The contrast between light pop and heavy metal is interesting, fresh.\u000a\u000aI personally like the heavier parts more, but then I feel that they wouldn't pack as much punch if it wasn't for the contrast. Take the pre-chorus of *Drop Dead Cynical* for one. ("I hope to thrill you that expectations rise", etc.) That piece of lyrics was super strong precisely because it came right after the light stuff.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, I'm a fan.
p86
aVI really enjoy them. I don't particularly find any meaning in their music, but it's still fun to listen to and always cheers me up. 
p87
aVI actually really love them. I saw them at the Graspop-site 2 years ago and thought hey that's the woman that sang on the Kamelot album and googled them. Loved them ever since. Their new album is quite great and I've got it signed! =D
p88
aVI think you'll find some love for them in this sub. Haven't gotten into Amaranthe myself yet, and I wasn't too impressed by the couple of songs that I listened to. 
p89
aVIf they dropped the rage voice they'd be awesome. 
p90
aVStrong disagreement. They'd be too light without the growler. I don't want that. And if I did, I'd still have Within Temptation.
p91
aVAgreed.
p92
aVThey are cheesy and samey but i like them a lot. Call out my name is probably their best song. It's actually really fantastic 
p93
aVCall out my name is my favorite from them as well! Great track and the chorus is amazing.
p94
aVI really love The Nexus and Burn With Me.
p95
aVI love The Nexus, but don't really like Burn With Me. It's a good song, but I just don't enjoy it
p96
aVI thought you meant the song by nightwish, momentarily. 
p97
aVMy discription could probably apply to the song, too. 
p98
aVNot one of my favorites, but I like them enough to listen on occasion. 
p99
aVI like them a lot.
p100
aV[alot](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSvMMvy6t105BXzxiCAemswjzz9HkDKQ99Kw7m3EX7HbQhMSAl7JialkHo)
p101
aVI really like them.  They changed the growl man to someone else that sounds a lot cleaner. 
p102
aVI like them a lot, harsh vocals included. Bought their new album the day it came out. It's not quite as consistently good as the last 2 imo, but it does have some great songs.\u000a\u000a
p103
aVI think they're great! Saw them open for Within Temptation last month and it was fantastic. 
p104
aV One of my favourites actually!
p105
aVAmaranthe, kinda like Nightwish, is whatever genre they want to be for a particular song. So here works as well as anywhere.
p106
aVThey're odd, style-wise. But I love Massive Addictive (the entire album). And Henrik Englund's growls are fucking immense. I have no idea how he can belt it out so smoothly without getting a sore throat but props to him.\u000a\u000a
p107
aVMost of their songs I don't care for, but I do like Hunger. 
p108
aVI love them, one of my favorite bands.  That's probably because I like pop music too.  I love Jessie J and Dragonette as well as bands like Epica and Within Temptation.
p109
aVI saw them during Within Temptations latest tour. Before that, I only heard a couple of songs by them. Thought they were kind of poppy, not my thing. That pretty much changed after their performance. They're able to mix everything without being overwhelming, and the heavy growls contrast nicely weight Elyze's voice. Plus they have some sweet headbanging moves on stage. 
p110
aVTheir lyrics make me cringe, but I saw them open for WT and it wasn't bad since I was only paying attention to the music. I just have a hard time accepting them because I associate Symphonic Metal with deep, meaningful music like Nightwish or Epica. I would still prefer them over anything on the radio though.
p111
aVThe more I listen to them, the more I enjoy them. Olof is amazing at creating catchy hooks while keeping his metal roots intact. 
p112
asVPythia's new album will be released in November, and the band will "live on" (although probably with a very different line-up)
p113
(lp114
VI'm surprised that the band will continue. All members but Emily appear to have quit, and one of them has stated that this would be Pythia's final album. [The website](http://www.pythiamusic.com/) and [the Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PythiaBand?fref=nf) name only Emily as a band member.
p115
aVHow big was Emily's role in the band? Did she compose and write the songs in addition to singing them?
p116
aVI'm pretty sure that she wrote all (?) the lyrics, but none of the music. This is my memory of an interview I once read, so I could be mistaken.\u000a\u000aPrior to the rest of the band quitting, Emily was accused by them to have changed the passwords to the social media accounts for Pythia. I suspect she was anticipating a Tarja-like dismissal. 
p117
aVShe probably took the name and replaced everyone else, like Amy Lee did to Evanescence eventually.
p118
asVEpica - Serenade of Self-Destruction
p119
(lp120
VPretty much my favorite song by any artist. I just love every part of it. The  Retrospect version is also outstanding!!
p121
aVEven though RFTI is probably my least favourite album of theirs, this is one of my favourite songs.
p122
aVI remember getting the first pressing of the CD before I'd seen the announcement about the error... I was majorly puzzled as to why this song had no vocals. 
p123
aVOmg... I only just realised  that my copy has that. I didn't notice because of the choir. I picked up the CD in HMV... 
p124
aVEpica posted a link on their site to a free download of the correct version soon after they found out, in both mp3 and lossless versions!
p125
aVThe lossless version had an error though. Time to head to pirate bay. But really, I have that version of the CD and it will probably be a collectable 10 years from now. 
p126
aVI think this is my favorite Epica song of them all. I am huge fan of their entire discography as well.
p127
aV[deleted]
p128
aVthe growling takes an already mediocre song and puts it into unlistenable territory
p129
asVGlobus - Preliator
p130
(lp131
VPretty awesome!\u000a\u000aAccording to [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_(music\u005c)), it was featured in the Spiderman 2 trailer.
p132
aV[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNaUFJi5Ugg) is where someone paired the song up with the lord of the rings movies. Quite effectively, I might add. This is where I first heard this song.\u000a\u000aThough the title includes the name Epica, we know it is not that band. See the description. 
p133
aVSounds like they used "Lacrimosa Dominae" by Trailerhead. Sounds really good.
p134
asVEpica - Unleashed (Retrospect) [Official Live Video]
p135
(lp136
VMan, I had the biggest smile on my face as I started watching that...amazing performance.
p137
aVEpica is one of the few bands that can blend metal and a symphony orchestra flawlessly. 
p138
asVLooking for Gothic Spirits
p139
(lp140
VI looked on Amazon (UK) and there seemed to be quite a few of them available. I'd not actually heard of them before so I'm not sure where else you'd be able to buy them, I'm afraid!
p141
aVI didn't think to look international. The US versions are selling for hundreds of dollars, hopefully the UK version is cheaper. I will look, thank you!
p142
aVIs Gothic Spirits the name of a band?  Sorry, I've never heard of it before and I'm always happy to discover something new.  
p143
aVSorry, its a series of albums that have music from a variety of gothic /symphonic bands. Think "NOW thats what I call Music" for goths.
p144
aVI honestly thought you meant gothic themed liquor and I came here to post about Therion's drinks.
p145
asVNew Sirenia album "The Seventh Life Path" announced [FB]
p146
(lp147
VFuck yeah, Nightwish, Kamelot AND Sirenia in a span of few months. Spring 2015 will be awesome for symphonic metal. I really hope they continue the path they started in the last album.
p148
aVKinda like last year's Epica, Xandria, Delain, and others all coming in April/May.
p149
aVI definitely like the artwork. I hope they continue in the same vein as the last album. 
p150
aVI hope so too, POTDB was awesome. Though I worry that this next one is coming out rather quickly.
p151
aVSaw a black robed figure and a white robed woman, immediately thought of Raistlin and Crysania from *Dragonlance*. Looked closer, was disappointed. \u000a\u000aBut I guess Nightwish already covered that briefly with Wishmaster.
p152
aVDragonlance was awesome. I remember hearing wishmaster for the first time and geeking out so hard about the references.
p153
aVI see they used Ad Libs to name their album again.
p154
aVThey sure love their sevens.
p155
aVI don't know how they keep pushing albums out like clockwork every 2 years, but I can't complain. 
p156
aVOh look, another predictable album name. How shocking =D\u000a\u000aSeriously though, I love the artwork and I'm cautiously excited about this. Their 3 albums after An Elixir For Existence were all a combination of bad or average, but Perils of the Deep Blue was a massive improvement and a return to roots. \u000a\u000aHeavier, bolder, stronger melodies with much better songwriting, vocals, a lot of which easily compete with their first 2 albums and even surpass them in some instances (like their masterpiece, "Stille Kom Døden", which is, IMO, the best song they've made to this day).
p157
aVAgreed, Stille Kom Døden is truly excellent. I find it strange that they haven't (as far as I know) played it live yet.
p158
asVOn this day in 2006: Delain released their debut album Lucidity
p159
(lp160
VGreat album. Like it alot.

p174
asVWithin Temptation - Silver Moonlight (Demo Version)
p175
(lp176
VThese demo's really give me hope for the new Within Temptation album! *[Let Us Burn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbYyewNk1yI)* is great too. Together with Nightwish this was the band that got me into symphonic metal in the first place. \u000a\u000aIn my opinion their greatest days were at the very beginning. *Enter*, *The Dance* and especially parts of *[Mother Earth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YbhB_A_8fM)* were amazing. *[The Silent Force](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOYgWyZ4Qz8)* and *[The Heart of Everything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICAORuEmO6U)* have brilliant songs too. \u000a\u000aThen it started going downhill. I wasn't blown away by *Black Symphony*, and didn't like the *Acoustic* album, *The Unforgiven* and especially not the *Q-Music Sessions* (covers). \u000a\u000aWhen they released [*Paradise (What About Us?)*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy6MpsDPKts) with Tarja I was pleasantly surprised. The demo's on the EP are great. Too bad [their new single](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAiV8RpqzME) isn't.
p177
aVAgreed, but I'm still dreading some of the tracks on the new album. 
p178
aVI think you are right about most of the things, but for me Paradise is so bland, generic and awkward. Sharon's and Tarja's voice don't resonate very good for me.
p179
aVAs someone who grew to love *The Unforgiving* as much as the rest of WT's back catalogue, I actually think the EP songs are a direct continuation of that style (which I view as rather unique and epic symphonic rock). This song is probably the most similar to their old style given Robert's harsh vocals and how Sharon is singing, but I'm not sure if that will still be evident on the final album.\u000a\u000aI'm definitely looking forward to *Hydra*, though I expect it will take a while to get into. I particularly loved *Paradise* and the EP songs, but *Dangerous* hasn't caught me at all so far. I'm actually really interested to hear the song with Xzibit, I like the fact that they're experimenting with something totally out of the box. But in general the best songs on WT's albums are the ones that don't get released as singles, so I'm looking forward to those.
p180
aVAfter a couple of listens i can say that i really like it, though i would like it even more without the growls.

sVFloor is at a video shoot for Nightwish! Looks like there are some hints on Titles and things in the description :)
p187
(lp188
VI was saying on r/Nightwish that I think "Find The Origin" is more of a teaser slogan for the theme of the album thana hint at the title - in the same way that they had "Open The Gates" for Imaginaerum. Together with the fossil t-shirt that the slogan was first printed on, it hints at a nature/evolution theme (which would explain Richard Dawkins!)\u000a\u000aI'm very excited for Christmas when they will reveal the full title. I'm hoping we'll get the artwork as well.
p189
aVExciting times! Can't wait for new music and to see them in 2015!

aVIf they are shooting a video today when can we expect the first single? I hope it's by the end of the year. In a month from now we could be having a new Nightwish song! I am very excited. 
p191
aVi wouldn't expect anything until February
p192
aVHmm, looking at previous lead single timings: Storytime was out 21 days before Imaginaerum, Amaranth was a month before DPP, Nemo was a month and a half before Once. So from that I would guess that we are looking at January/February next year, if the album is released in March.

VThe soprano opera singer featured in this video is Veronica Bordacchini, in case if any of you are wondering. 
p198
aVShe's fantastic, thanks for posting this! It's not really what one would expect from the band, but I fully welcome it.
p199
aVDoes she tour with them? I seem to remember their Wacken video had her in.
p200
aVWhen I saw them in Bristol they had a female soprano with them - she was wearing a mask though, so not certain if it was the same person!
p201
aVYup, she's a permanent member, I believe
p202
aVGreat video! To anyone not familiar with Fleshgod Apocalypse, this is actually both "Prologue" and "Epilogue"
p203
aVI love this band. I saw them at the Tonic Lounge in Portland and it was fantastic. I did not expect the opera singer to be live! 
p204
asVI got to meet Dianne from Xandria and Charlotte from Delain at last night's Sonata Arctica show!
p205
(lp206
VThey were all so nice too and more than happy to talk with fans. I asked Charlotte about whether Marco would ever sing with them on Nightwish's USA tour next year, and she basically said "fingers crossed". I talked a bit with Dianne about Pathfinder and how she got involved with them. She was taken aback that someone actually had seen her perform with Pathfinder. They were completely down to earth and approachable too.\u000a\u000aI'm seeing all the bands again tomorrow night in Houston, but with a VIP ticket this time, so I can finally get pictures with my favorite band and get their autographs.\u000a\u000a/fanboy rave
p207
aVCharlotte is amazing. When I saw Delain last year I was in the front and really singing along to some songs, and she noticed me in the crowd and started singing to me and pointing at me for the entire song. When I met her afterwards, she recognised me and told me I have good energy. :D
p208
aVToday i found out that [DarkestSin](http://hr.reddit.com/user/DarkestSin) and [UnlostHorizon](http://hr.reddit.com/user/UnlostHorizon) are members of [THIS CLUB.](http://new3.fjcdn.com/comments/Because+he+would+be+a+lucky+bastard+_5102f346e5dd9125f9f267f334b00240.jpg)

aVhuehuehue
p210
aVHaha, I've waited 4 years to see Sonata Arctica live, and 3 years to see Xandria live; I deserve this, dammit!
p211
aVOn a side note, Sonata are fucking awesome live, too.
p212
aVOh yeah, especially on this tour. On the SGHN tour, it was depressing to see just how moody and inactive the whole band was. This new tour is energetic and so much more fun and lively.
p213
aVI can see slightly why they were bland when I saw them. It was about a year and a half ago. But I still thought it was cool.
p214
aVInteresting, I saw them in the Netherlands when they were touring after SGHN and they were pretty damn energetic then imo.
p215
aVI'm not sure it's possible to see her live and not fall in love.
p216
aV0 chance
p217
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Puvj2KtKlc\u000a
p218
aVShe's so adorable. You just know performing is her favourite thing in the world. Giant goofball.
p219
aVawesome. Hoping they will take some time to meet fans when they come to my city.
p220
aVDelain and Xandria (and the local openers, Immortal Guardian, who are incredible), all went over to the merch booths after Sonata's performance to take pictures, sign stuff, and talk with the fans. It was great to see them being so personal with the fans.
p221
aVImmortal guardians are pretty amazing. I saw them in edinburg, texas this year. Surprised they aren't more famous
p222
aVThey're working on their first full-length album right now, which will be a sequel to their current EP. Hopefully that'll generate some buzz for them. 
p223
aVCool. Hope to see them after the show in Orlando
p224
aVBoth openers were very cool and willing to hang out. On the other hand I thought it was a little disappointing that Sonata Arctica themselves now charged for meet and greets when only two tours ago they hung out after the show...
p225
aVIt's a money thing. I'm sure you could still catch up with them after the show near the tour buses if you waited about an hour, but most bands do these VIP ticket meet and greets to offset the costs of the tour. It just wouldn't be feasible for them to meet everyone who shows up to their shows. In previous tours they had tiny crowds; on this one, they had more people show up because of Delain and Xandria.
p226
aVThis. I know people see it as a cash grab, but symphonic metal bands don't make much in the US. VIP tickets are a simple and cheap way for them to help cover venue costs. Besides, it isn't really that hard to catch the band after the show. A band's main source of income is merchandise and tour tickets. They don't make squat on music sales.
p227
aVAnd that all makes sense, I just don't like the way they end up working most of the time. $50 on top of ticket price for a handshake, photo and autograph. Meanwhile, Iced Earth gave out special limited edition singles, tote bags, t-shirts, and hung out for like 20 minutes just talking. And this is the band with a reputation as jerks. even the stuff isn't necessary, I just feel like for most bands, they just want to get it over with.
p228
aVThat's true. Some bands can seem like they don't give two shits.\u000a\u000aThe Nighwish VIP experience seemed that way last tour, but they were going through so much turmoil, so I can forgive them. Assuming they aren't the same way next year. :-\u005c
p229
aVI got to see three bands from across the Atlantic for 35$. They can't be making much money. 
p230
aVIt was kind of surprising to me how few people stayed after at the show I went to (Portland) to interact with them.  I only had to wait for a few people wanting pictures with Dianne for her and the guys to sign my shirt.  She came across as a truly genuine, nice person that was happy to be there, and the guys were a bit more reserved but cool.  I'm glad they were willing to put themselves out there and hope they had a positive experience with the fans.
p231
aVI can't tell you how many people stayed behind after the show to meet the bands, because I'd be surprised if we even had 100 people in the venue to begin with. I feel like a good 30 people or so got a chance to talk to and get pictures taken with the bands, though.

aVOn April 18 the Dutch metal band Stream of Passion will release their new album A War of Our Own through Pias/Rough Trade. A War Of Our Own is the result of the struggle the band had to endure after they decided to part ways with their record label and continue on their own path. \u000a\u000aLeader of the pack Marcela Bovio: \u201cA corporate impasse such as this affects your peace of mind. The idea of crowdfunding changed everything. It was heart-warming to see how many people were prepared to support us and what they were willing to do to secure our future. Through this we've grown closer to our fans, they played a major part in creating this album.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe red thread of the album is conflict in all its forms: personal battles, like disease and depression, corporate battles the band was confronted with themselves, but also the turmoil that destroys a land, mainly the drug wars of Mexico, the native country of Bovio. Musically the band has perfected their sound by ambitiously pushing their boundaries;  A War Of Our Own is more progressive and melodic than ever, with symphonic elements and an emotional undertone, heavy with Latin-American influences. \u000a\u000aIn the last nine years Stream of Passion has released three studio albums, and a live-cd/dvd. In the meantime the band has also been touring the world, i.a. in Europe, Canada, Russia and Israel with bands like Epica, Sirenia, Leaves\u2019 Eyes and Xandria. Around the release date several Dutch shows are planned, with two additional shows in the UK, a tour in Germany and a show at the Made of Metal Fest in the Czech Republic.

p252
aVAt the Lake, a Polish band whose first EP was [really great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PD_NNMUlh4), but whose first full-length album didn't really quite attain the same quality.
p253
aVHmm, well when I first heard [Whyzdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjX2a5ScEn8) I thought they would be huge - they're not doing badly but keep having singer troubles. Their original singer was replaced with Clementine Delauney who then left to join Serenity before their second album was finished. They then had to redo all the vocals with a new singer but she left too and now they're onto their 4th singer. It's held them back a lot but I hope they keep going.
p254
aVFirst thought was We are the Fallen. Gods, I really think they are good, I don't think they'll ever come out with a new album.
p255
aVLast I heard was that they were on a bit of a break because their singer had a baby, but they were planning on doing another album and had written some songs for it. So we'll see! Would be nice if they did come back.
p256
aVShe had her child in 2012, which is when they mentioned they had content for songs, the last action on their facebook was in January I think. It's not looking good.
p257
aVThought I'd check their Twitters, it seems Carly said she was recording something in December but didn't say what, whereas Ben Moody's Twitter only mentions stuff he's done with his new project. So not much of a hint there either.

aVFor japanese bands... \u000a\u000a* [Matenrou Opera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72RbMHylx2M) - quite similar to versailles.. you'll like them... \u000a* [Galneryus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFoljzvePs) - high-tempo modern power metal, less symphonic, that's more 'masculine'. very loved band by power metla fans\u000a* [Liv Moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyh13P4F8ss) - a women-fronted band.. kinda like early nightwish sound with anette vocals... \u000a\u000aAlso, not japanese but I find [Serenity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2QH9L42OY0) has a bit of a similar style

And its a better concept to watch en listen to. \u000a\u000aI wish that Kamijo made some remakes of his old song(From LAREINE) with his more experienced voice and a more symphinc sound.

p292
(lp293
VThe band in question posted on their facebook page coming out against the leak...in all caps.\u000a\u000aWhy am I afraid they're going to get backlash for this?
p294
aVTo be honest, Nightwish get backlash for everything. They'd only have to post "hello!" and they'd get a thousand replies saying "you suck, bring back Tarja!"\u000a\u000aI feel pretty sorry for them, tbh. It's a chap situation that they're obviously upset about but now they've gone the wrong way in dealing with it and they're going to get a ton of abuse again. No wonder they don't like the internet!\u000a\u000aThere was a much more measured statement from Tuomas this morning on his official Facebook. I'm guessing it was Marco who posted the all-caps one, but I'm not certain.
p295
aVFor the lazy:  \u000a\u000a&gt;OUR INTENTION WAS NOT NECESSARILY TO ATTACK AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON, BUT TO RAISE AWARENESS THAT SPREADING UNRELEASED PROPERTY THROUGH INTERNET IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANY ARTIST WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. THIS IS ABOUT OUR MUSICAL PROPERTY AND THE ABUSE OF IT, WE ARE NOT ANONYMOUS, EITHER. THIS KIND OF THING CAUSES IRREPARABLE HARM TO COUNTLESS PEOPLE WORKING IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE. NOT ONLY FOR THE BAND.    \u000a\u000aAnd I think they might get a little backlash like you said. As much as it sucks, things get leaked all of the time. It's the internet, once it's out there you can't stop it. They just need to embrace it and stop complaining. With that said, I still haven't given it a listen. I'll probably wait until the album is out. 
p296
aVI definitely agree that it would be better to avoid paying attention to it. Maybe even a small "the single isn't out yet, anything you hear is unofficial" message. I don't think they will ever embrace it. I'm an author and if someone ever stole an unfinished version of my work and spread it around I'd be devastated... It's such a tough thing for any type of artist.
p297
aVKinda ridiculous to claim no artist wants it. There are plenty of modern artists in all media that embrace leaks. Some just want their product enjoyed. Hell, there have been gaming companies that patch pirated versions of the game. Nine Inch Nails once (they may still) had a torrent link for their whole discography. 
p298
aVthey're getting backlash because they exposed a fan to cyberbullying by not blurring out the fan's name and sic'ing their army of screaming fangirls on them.\u000a\u000aif they had just removed all the links they found and made a post about how much it upsets them, that's one thing. exposing the fan to be bullied is another.
p299
aVyeah I just lost some respect for them. They have every right to be upset, but blatantly exposing a girl's name like that and allowing everyone to cyberbully her is kinda sickening. They're making themselves look like money-hungry music artists. Reminds me of the Metallica/napster days. I mean seriously it's the fucking internet, you can't stop the leak. It has a name (streisand effect) for a reason... 
p300
aVHonestly, I don't think that was what the band intended. Nightwish are terrible when it comes to social media and the internet - from everything I've heard about them, they don't like getting involved with it and don't really understand it. (With the exception of Floor, but she only posts on her own account.) I think they just had an instinctive reaction and didn't have any idea of the repercussions! I'm sure they've learnt their lesson now that everyone's had a go at them about it.

aVI love this song, like most of Epica's songs, and this video isnt bad as far as Metal videos go. Sure it could have been a bit better, but its hard to get really good clips that fit with a genre like Symphonic Metal.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Music video is not new, but the song is still good
p309
aVSymphonic metal has notoriously bad videos, but I've always liked this one.
p310
aVI thought this was one was new too, but I'm not very familiar with Epica. I'm not really a fan but I really, really like this song and video clip. It has such a great melody!\u000a\u000aThe clip is really well made, the  studio doing it did a very good job. The visuals are very well done! 
p311

p314
(lp315
VKinda bummed about this album, to be honest, but I did like this song quite a bit.
p316
aVI think that sometimes people are reluctant to change. WT have always been about trying new things, and they're influenced by a lot of stuff. They want to try everything at once, but they can't, so they try to do it by album. it's still very epic, though. I saw them live for the first time a couple of months ago and they brought me to tears. (Totally not just because I got to meet her and tell her my name is Sinead, and she responded "Oh, the real one?")\u000a\u000aSometimes it takes a while for albums to grow on you. I'd say listen to Silver Moonlight and Edge of the World again. Oh, and Paradise.
p317
aVOh, I'm fine with change as long as it's interesting. Their last album was great, I thought, but I find this one to be very one-note and dull. This song is a good example; despite being one of the best songs on the album, elevated quite a bit by the guest singer, it's still extremely repetitive.
p318
aVI understand where you're coming from.
p319
aVI'm the opposite. I thought their last album was awful. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't get into it. I liked Hydra, although some songs weren't that great. 
p320
aV[deleted]
p321
aVI hate rap. Always have, ever since I was a little kid. So when the album came out, I was ready to hate this song.\u000a\u000aYeah, didn't end up that way.  Ended up being my favorite song on the whole album. \u000a\u000aI love the video. The fantasy and almost.. cyberpunk, I guess, mashup, just feels *fun*. 
p322
aVIt's always a fun music video where the climax is someone punching a wall to death.
p323
aVExactly!\u000a
p324
aVJust noticed it now, but Stefan is in this video and not Robert. Seems like he's taking more of a step back this time.

aVtl;dw black man escapes slavery

aVThey were all enslaved. It's why they have the little matrix-plug things on their arms.
p327
aVIt kind of reminds me of Linkin Park's videos from like a decade ago... things like In The End, haha.\u000a\u000aI think this song is ok, but I'm not sure why they keep announcing that it's a fan favourite. I've mainly only heard complaints about it.
p328
aVIt's a very symphonic video. Greenscreens, lots of moving about haha. Delain's video for Stardust had them in space. \u000a\u000aI haven't heard any complaints...people said it was a bit weird and they were surprised, but I know a lot of people enjoy the song. I love it. I thought it was really fantastic live, as well. You can tell they love to perform it :)
p329
aVIndeed I know it's Sharon's fave from the album so she sings it very passionately which is awesome! And yeah, I remember when the album came out I heard mostly negative comments about that song, ranging from it just not being people's favourite to people outright hating it because of the rapping. Perhaps it's grown on people...
p330
aVI think its a really inspiring song. It's big and meaningful and really fun.
p331
aVUsually I am also very sceptical about rap, but turns out if you combine it with symphonic metal it might come out sounding alright... \u000aHave been listening to this version all the time:  \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92cBaQ6WUVc&amp;
p332
aVI'm always a little disappointed when the band players act so calm and unexcited. I mean, it's a video, why not act a little more passionate even if that's not your usual state of mind?
p333
aV[Obligatory](http://i.imgur.com/TslQTF3.jpg)\u000a\u000aIf you go into it knowing it's going to be a WT video, with Sharon looking like she's singing a lullaby and the rest of the band has their serious face, with the epic background and bluescreen work....well, it's pretty good.

asVBig 4 of Symphonic Metal?
p339
(lp340
VI've always thought of it as a big 3 including Epica, Nightwish, and Within Temptation.
p341
aVI'd add Therion in there, too, with all of their pioneering 1990s work and the sheer amount of albums they've put out since.
p342
aVYeap, same here
p343
aVas much as i agree that within temptation is a symphonic metal band, i just don't find them to be a good representation.\u000a\u000athere's just something about them that is...off\u000a\u000ai guess that's a personal opinion though
p344
aVWell according to Last.fm the top 4 are Nightwish, Therion, Epica and Within Temptation.\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/lSLTwiV.jpg
p345
aVEpica, Nightwish, Kamelot, After Forever.
p346
aVTHIS! Within Temptation doens't belong with them. These ARE the big four.
p347
aVMy call would be Nightwish, Within Temptation, Epica, After Forever.\u000a\u000aHowever, I think that Xandria, Delain, Within Temptation, and Lacuna Coil more adequately cover the genre.
p348
aVI adore Lacuna Coil but I don't think they're symphonic metal. They don't really use any symphonic elements. As for the others, all good picks!
p349
aVSonata Arctica, Xandria, Delain.  On tour.
p350
aVYep, I'm planning on seeing them in Denver on October 4!
p351
aVI think most people will answer Nightwish, Epica and Within Temptation! So if there had to be a fourth band it would be debatable. According to Google, Rhapsody of Fire is the 4th most popular, followed by Therion and Kamelot.
p352
aVLets just have a "Big 12" and get all who deserve :P
p353
aVHaha yes, good idea!
p354
aVEpica and Nightwish. The rest is debatable, but I'd answer Kamelot and Rhapsody since I'm more on the power metal side of the spectrum.
p355
aVHonestly, since symphonic metal has exploded in popularity within the last 10-15 years, I'd say it's hard to pinpoint a Big 4. A number of bands deserve it, and each with their own reasons and the wide spectrum of musical styles. The biggest influences are obvious; Epica, Nightwish, Therion, Kamelot, Rhapsody of Fire, Within Temptation, and quite a few others. They've all helped this genre grow.
p356
aVNightwish, Apocalyptica, Epica and Within Temptation.\u000a\u000aThey are the four biggest and most talked about bands. Even if you think one or more of these are not that good, everyone you talk to will have an opinion on all these bands.
p357
aVApocalyptica? Seriously?
p358
aVI'd say Within Temptation, Nightwish, Edenbridge, Amberian Dawn imo
p359
aVMate, what were you *thinking*, you didn't reply with the same bands as everyone else did!
p360
aV[deleted]
p361
aVNightwish, Delain, Kamelot, and Within Temptation.
p362
aVThe sins of thy beloved, Tristania, Sirenia and Trail of Tears. I know they do not meet your requirements, but my top 4 without question. Good old gothic classics that will never die.\u000a\u000aBig 4? Nightwish, Epica, Within Temptation, the last one is kinda hard. As mentioned before I think Lacuna coil or Delain could fill that last spot. I've just mentioned bands with female vocalists though to make it "easy".

VApologies if this isn't quite the subreddit for this. It's not the hard and heavy symphonic metal we're used to hearing here but the swing in tempos and intensities combined with some movie-trailer style epic instrumentals made me think of several Within Temptation, Nightwish and Epica songs.
p372
aVI was going to ask how in the world could this be considered Symphonic Metal, but holy shit that song is outstanding!  Thanks for sharing!!
p373
aVi agree.. this was some good stuff.
p374
aVI wouldn't really call Les Friction symphonic metal, maybe symphonic rock, but not metal. They're far closer to the production music made by Immediate Music, Two Steps From Hell and the like.
p375
aVGreat song. I recommend anyone who likes this song to check out Globus. Their song, Doomsday is pretty good.

p400
(lp401
VBeliever is a band that has inspired quite a few other bands, but no one has ever heard of them... but do you really think this song "started it all?" Symphonic metal did not exist before 1990? I guess I don't know that much history...\u000a\u000aI always thought that Extol was the best "style baby" of Believer. [Example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44sUpTBooDs) On their first two albums, they had some strings even, though not a full symphonic feel. [Example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qS9xUkbkag)\u000a\u000aEdit: Just read the [wikipedia article on symphonic metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_metal). Looks like you're right... Believer was first, then Therion and Waltari, then Nightwish, and then everybody! I guess I was around and following the birth of Symphonic metal while it happened and didn't even realize it! I always assumed that there were lots of other bands out there that I didn't know about. 
p402
aVOn a sidenote, the Wikipedia article on symphonic metal is pretty bad.
p403
aVYou can improve it!
p404
aVTherion was the first true symphonic metal band. I have read in several places that this song was one of the main things that inspired them to change from death metal and go in a more symphonic/operatic direction. If you listen, you can hear a lot of the characteristics that are present in Therion's work.  If you want to go way back, I suppose that you could also cite Led Zeppelin's Kashmir and Rainbow's Stargazer as early examples of symphonic metal as well but I feel like this song really started the modern symphonic metal sound. 
p405
aV&gt; If you want to go way back, I suppose that you could also cite Led Zeppelin's Kashmir and Rainbow's Stargazer as early examples of symphonic metal as well\u000a\u000aEven earlier (1973), some of the Ozzy era Black Sabbath songs were symphonic metal. They literally were metal with symphonic elements. [Spiral Architect(1973)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESFH1gNsARw), [Supertzar(1975)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ska3C80ysk)\u000a\u000aEdit: Holy shit, Stargazer is a good song. And double Holy Shit, it's Dio singing! [Link for the lazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6CjO0H2j0s)
p406
aVOh, that's a great point about Led Zeppelin. 
p407
aVInteresting, I always thought that Therion was just experimenting around. Were there any other bands that notably influenced their change of style?
p408

aVI really like The Escapist radio which is run by the mods from Tuomas Holopainen's official site. If you keep an eye on their schedule,  they've occasionally had symphonic metal nights, but in general they play quite a lot of the genre anyway (and a lot of Nightwish of course)! Also you could try things like Last.fm radio if you're just looking to try new bands that are similar to your taste.
p422
aVFunnily enough, the reason I'm looking for radio streams is for Euro Truck Simulator 2 game. It already has tons of european radio stations built in, but you can add additional radio stations to listen to while you drive. I know it's silly, but it's fun.

Vocalist/songwriter.\u000a* [Russell Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Allen) (?) - Symphony X and about a billion other projects.  Vocalist/songwriter.  I actually don't recognize the picture, but Russell Allen absolutely has to be on here somewhere, and this one looks most like him.\u000a* [Tarja Turunen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarja_Turunen) - Formerly of Nightwish, now does a solo act.  Vocalist/songwriter, and, apparently, pianist.\u000a* [Tommy Karevik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Karevik) - ~~Formerly of~~ Seventh Wonder, now Kamelot.

Vocalist/songwriter, possibly retired?\u000a* [Manuela Kraller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuela_Kraller) - Formerly of Xandria.

Unfortunately I lost the source and even reverse image search can't seem to find the original.\u000a\u000aThe tattoo is real, I believe she got it after the DPP era. There's another photo of it here: http://i.imgur.com/AMQbmU6.jpg

Although...a lot of bands experiment, try new things, completely change their style, etc so I guess it's not like they SHOULDN'T be considered symphonic metal either....)
p449
aVI certainly consider SymX to be symphonic (lot of keyboards, choir, strings, etc), but they could also be prog or power metal depending on your definitions.  The real reason you see Russell Allen around here is that he's one of the most prolific guest vocalists in the genre:\u000a\u000a* [Sweet Curse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_eADl0y4s) with ReVamp/Floor Jansen\u000a* [Victims of the Modern Age](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAMgY9_KhEU) with Star One/Floor Jansen/Damian Wilson/Dan Swanö\u000a* [Dawn of a Million Souls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_z4LTWvpOY) with Ayreon/Damian Wilson (and guitar solo by Michael Romeo of SymX)\u000a* [Stargazers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXuN3UiZKHI) with Avantasia/Jørn Lande/Michael Kiske/Oliver Hartmann\u000a* Nightwish's arrangement of [Phantom of the Opera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6jaNRbDo8U) with Floor Jansen\u000a\u000a...you get the picture.

aVEspecially in broad daylight, though maybe something was implied in the lyrics and it was missed.\u000a\u000aBut that's a minor point - very impressive especially for only three members.
p533
aVI think its a Charon/River Styx/Boatmaster Lantern type thing. Just going by the title being Crossing the River and having some other allusions to death in the lyrics like falling from grace and promised land. 
p534
aVIt's actually about the book/film Bridge to Terabithia, hence the lines 'Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open', 'Nothing crushes us' etc :) Crossing The River and falling from grace is quite literal, Leslie attempted to cross the river, but instead died in it. The lantern was a bit of a nod to the promotional materials of the film where Leslie is pictured with a lantern :)

There's some songs where I just have to listen to the intro track before the song - off the top of my head, You Create/What I See by Lacuna Coil is one of those and also Tumman Virran Taa/The Heathen Throne by Ensiferum.

sVHonest Question: What is up with Hydra (WT)?
p558
(lp559
VI quite enjoy *Hydra*. It's not my favourite WT album (it might even be my least favourite) but I don't hate it, by any means. The absolute best song on there is *Paradise* for me - probably helped by the fact that it has my favourite music video ever. I really like *Silver Moonlight*, *Covered by Roses* and *Tell Me Why*. The other songs are all just OK for me. \u000a\u000aI prefer the version of *Whole World Is Watching* with Piotr Rogucki, because he sounds a lot more enthusiastic to me, and doesn't do that strange laugh at the beginning. But I really dislike how that song ends so abruptly - that's something that puts me off listening to the album all the way through.\u000a\u000aThis album is missing something special, but I couldn't tell you what it is. Maybe it is the hooks. And hey, I have friends who love this album, and friends who wouldn't have listened to symphonic metal without it. But I do hope I'll enjoy the next WT record a lot more.
p560
aVI liked Hydra. Personally, I'm impressed that they have the guts to try something *different* - it's not easy to do when you're expected to only produce one kind of song. \u000a\u000aSharon mentioned that they'd done everything they could with their usual style with *The Heart of Everything*, so it's understandable that they're looking for new avenues. *The Unforgiving*, for example, focused on storytelling with music, which makes it my favorite WT album. *Hydra* focuses on diverse genres and styles, which the name itself alludes to.\u000a\u000aIt's not for everyone, but to say that it's boring or crap is... a bit strong, I think. I liked *Covered by Roses* and *Tell Me Why*, not to mention the opening three tracks. It's a very solid album overall, it just lacks the high points that *The Quantum Enigma* has, for example.\u000a\u000aI'd be disappointed if they'd continued churning out the same thing over and over again. So kudos to them for being innovative. \u000a
p561
aVI think [Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy6MpsDPKts) is a great song, and I like [Silver Moonlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAQx4VPwwGs) too. Other than that Hydra didn't impress me either.
p562
aVI'll confess, I had forgotten about Paradise \u000a\u000aBut then a song like *And We Run* comes up and is just garbage. :(\u000a\u000aIt is sad because so many of the songs are *close* to being good, but then they just fall short.\u000a\u000aOn the plus side, the music videos are actually pretty good. Heh. They actually got budget. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p563
aVI have to admit that I actually love And We Run. I have no idea why. On paper it's terrible, symphonic metal mixed with rap and Xzibit?!  But it's just a catchy song. 
p564
aVDo people really dislike And We Run and Dangerous? I personally loved the diversity of the artists they invited to do guest vocals. Howard is generally well-received in whatever he does, and regardless of what people want to say, Xzibit is not a platinum-selling rapper for no reason.\u000a\u000aThey obviously don't measure up to Paradise, but come on, Tarja can't be beaten when it comes to symphonic, and the fact that Paradise was so good doesn't make the other songs bad.
p565
aVI generally don't like rap music at all, but I loved And We Run. Yes, it's definitely different and not like any other symphonic metal I know, or even like normal WT for that matter, but I enjoyed it.
p566
aVI love the album, but Whole World is Watching is the worst WT ever. 
p567
aVI like it.  It's not my favorite but I like all the songs on Hydra.  I got to see them live in September and I really enjoyed seeing them play the Hydra songs.  
p568
aVI give the album 3 out of 5 stars. I don't hate it, but I wish it were better. They really branched out and experimented and I can appreciate that. I just hope they're using this album as a jumping-off point for a really stellar next album.\u000a\u000a1. **"Let Us Burn"**: Not great, but not bad. Fine for background music.\u000a2. **"Dangerous"**: Repetitive. Howard Jones adds nothing to this song.\u000a3. **"And We Run"**: Catchy but ridiculous. I really dislike rap. I bet a version without Xzibit would be good.\u000a4. **"Paradise (What About Us?)"**: Interesting. Glad to see Tarja featured, but I don't think her voice meshes well with Sharon's. Overall I like it though.\u000a5. **"Edge Of The World"**: Meh. Not memorable.\u000a6. **"Silver Moonlight"**: Driving rhythm and growled vocals. Cool. Classic WT.\u000a7. **"Covered By Roses"**: My favorite song on the album. Catchy chorus and melody.\u000a8. **"Dog Days"**: OK, but gets repetitive and annoying at the end.\u000a9. **"Tell Me Why"**: Decent, fits WT.\u000a10. **"Whole World Is Watching"**: I hate this one and try to pretend it doesn't exist.\u000a\u000aBonus Tracks\u000a\u000a11. **"Radioactive"**: I like it better than the original.\u000a12. **"Summertime Sadness"**: Nice sound, fun to listen to.\u000a13. **"Let Her Go"**: Fine, just not my taste.\u000a14. **"Dirty Dancer"**: OK song.\u000a\u000aIt's fun to listen to all the evolution tracks and see how they arrived at the final song.
p569
aVParadise is excellent. Let Us Burn is pretty good. Dangerous, sure, I like it. But I strongly agree that the rest of the album is weak. The Unforgiving lost me at the first listen, but I later realized how much I actually loved it, like 2 years and a few more listens later, when I started to get back into WT. I figured it would take a few listens like The Unforgiving did. But, no. Never caught on. Bummed...
p570
aVI got the version of the album with the bonus evolution tracks, and it was cool to see that Tell Me Why at one point was a little heavier with more grunts. I kind of liked that version better, but that might just be because I'm a huge Epica fan and I'm used to harsh vocals, although early WT had them as well. \u000aHydra is them experimenting with all genres and trying to branch out. Although Its definitely not my favorite album, I feel like it was good for them to try an album like this at some point, and their next album will probably be more focused/closer to their original style.
p571
aVThe Unforgiving was pretty great, largely because of how it was a concept album and it had a consistent tone and aesthetic to it.\u000a\u000aI really disagree on Hydra though. I think it's a great album. Not amazing, but great. It's very experimental and draws influences from their previous albums, as well as other music genres, and it's one of the most innovative efforts I've seen in the symphonic rock/metal space.
p572
aVThe Unforgiving was pretty great. Hydra is terrible, with the exception of Paradise which is one of WT's best songs.\u000a\u000aThe fact that Hydra got good reviews can only mean that these reviews were written by monkeys. I can't find any other logical explanation. IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THOUGH, fans of symphonic metal will most likely shudder at the thought of Hydra, whereas it might be a high-quality production for the pop crowd. 
p573
aVIt gets good reviews because it's not being compared to their older music.
p574
aVThat album is really bad. I accepted 'The Unforgiving' which I didnt like before but I can't like Hydra at all. Its way too commercial for my likes. 
p575
aVI'm with you in that I hated it. I've listened to it twice, once when I got it and once six months later to see if it improved with age. \u000a\u000aI think the problem is for a lot of people that you can see a progression from the silent force-the heart of everything-the unforgiven. hydra seems to break that progression and as far as I can tell was made purely to break into America. \u000a\u000aTBH when they release another album I'm probably not going to buy it straight away like the mother's. I'll wait until I hear a dodgy copy to see if I like it. \u000a\u000abands do this all the time though. I went from loving Metallica (pre load) to hating them (after load).

asVNow that Nightwish's released "Showtime, Storytime", how do you feel about Floor Jansen?
p589
(lp590
VFloor is my favorite vocalist and Nightwish my favorite band, it's the best thing that could have happened. Also she rocks live.
p591
aVI have seen Floor live two times this year (once at the concert recorded on "Showtime, Storytime" and at Retrospect) and I wholeheartedly agree. While I didn't have any problems with Anette - maybe because I discovered Nightwish only after Tarja left and never had the pleasure of seeing her perform with Nightwish in person - I now like Nightwish even more than before as Floor is able to perform both the songs "written for" Anette and those from Tarja's time fabulously.
p592
aVIt's kind of weird for me hearing Floor in a softer scene of Symphonic metal because i'm so used to her in After Forever and I'm a bigger fan of the heavier symphonic metal.\u000a\u000aHowever, I think Floor was brilliant with Nightwish. The only song i've listened to her with Nightwish so far is Ever Dream, which is absolutely brilliant and it's live as well.\u000a\u000aId be nice to see more heavier songs from nightwish, but i'll take what i can get.
p593
aV&gt;The only song i've listened to her with Nightwish so far is Ever Dream\u000a\u000a[Ghost Love Score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA). Listen to it!
p594
aVThat is by far my favorite song and she does it just as well as Tarja.
p595
aVI can't wait to see the DVD. Until I do I can't judge as I haven't heard them with Floor. But I've always been a fan of Nightwish, Revamp and After Forever.
p596
aV[Here is a song from the live dvd from the official channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvkYwOJZONU)
p597
aVThanks for this! I'm totally in love with her now!
p598
aVI became a fan of Nightwish when Dark Passion Play came out and a friend leant me a CD. So I started as a fan of Annette, and then as I bought their back catalogue I became a fan of Tarja as well. I never understood the hatred of one or the other because I enjoyed both of their voices for totally different reasons. I thought Tuomas's analogy that Tarja sang like a beautiful, cold mountain stream and Annette like a warm storyteller was spot on. As for the live performances (having only seen Tarja on DVD and solo) I found Tarja's technique a bit all over the place but in general she has great stage presence and can be very energetic. Annette gave great live performances too, though she was noticeably much better at the songs that were written for her voice, I still mostly enjoyed her versions of older songs.\u000a\u000aAs for Floor, I was always impressed with her voice in After Forever. I then saw her live with ReVamp and was amazed - I'd never seen someone sing so well live before. She effortlessly went from operatic vocals to rock vocals and even into some growls which she was only just learning to do at the time. So when I heard she was going to sing with Nightwish, I knew straight away that she'd do a good job. The only thing that worried me was that I'd never felt particularly moved or emotional when listening to her songs before, though I really enjoyed them (I'm still not sure why), so I was worried that I wouldn't connect with her voice in Nightwish. Well, I went to see them in London, and was proved completely 100% wrong because I cried like a baby all the way through Ghost Love Score and was instantly hooked. \u000a\u000aI haven't got the DVD yet (fingers crossed it will arrive tomorrow) but I've seen the couple of videos released from it and was as impressed as always. I can see why some people might think Floor is over-hyped - it can be difficult to avoid people talking about how great she is online - and I admit I felt rather uncomfortable with people's unquestioning adoration of her when many were so vitriolic towards Annette. But Floor has more than earned my admiration and respect through her performances. I can't wait for a studio album!
p599
aVTarja's departure was in 2005. Floor's After Forever disbanded in 2006. I've been wishing for Floor to join Nightwish ever since. Took them way too long, but at least they got together in the end :-)
p600
aVWhen you think about it, After Forever is the reason we have Epica and Floor's Nightwish.\u000a\u000aNot a huge fan of the band but hey, gotta admit they did a good job at finding some good talents :D
p601
aVI liked Anette until I saw her live.\u000a\u000aNow I reserve judgement until I see Nightwish in concert again. \u000a\u000aMy biggest problem is not the vocal, but that I didn't liked Imaginaerum.
p602
aVThe one thing I don't like about Floor + Nightwish is the circlejerk.\u000a\u000aI have been unable to understand the amount of hype voiced in here. I never followed After Forever neither was I exposed to Floor's work before. And when I hear her perform I can't get what people are so fascinated with.\u000a\u000aMaybe the fact that people where so vocal about how awesome they thought having Floor stepping in as the new vocalist was ruined it for me.\u000a\u000aIt's like when you are going to watch a movie and everybody tells you it the best movie ever and how awesome it its. Then you go watch it and even if its great, you are underwhelmed.\u000a\u000aI'll reserve my judgement for when I hear a studio recording of her performance with Nightwish.
p603
aVDid you pick up the Revamp release. Thats why people are excited about floor, she isn't a one trick poney. She has a myriad of different voices to offer toumas when he is writing music.
p604
aVTHIS! Tarja and Annette were both too limited in their vocals to really let Tuomas cut lose creatively.
p605
aVI can see how fans have over-hyped Floor. \u000a\u000aI personally think it was because of all her work with After Forever and other things (like ReVamp, Ayreon, guest appearances with Epica, etc, etc.) At least that's what made me very excited about the prospect of Floor joining. My main criticism of Anette has always been that she was all wrong for their older work, she couldn't swing it without them having to make significant changes. Floor can.\u000a\u000aThat said, I'm a little sad that there's not too much sung in the opera-style, even with songs that used to be sung that way by Tarja. Seems like overall, they are just done with that type of style, even though Floor can properly sing it. I was excited to get opera vocals back, and they're kind of not back... so now I'm also waiting for a studio album before I get more (or less) excited about Floor+Nightwish. 
p606
aVTotally agree about the operatic vocals. I can understand how Floor might want to make her own style, rather than emulating Tarja for now. Hopefully we'll get more as time goew by.
p607
aVTuomas said they'd go back to the operatic vocals "occasionally" but that he was keen to use all the other aspects of Floor's voice. So she might even be doing some growls.
p608
aVI had never heard of Floor until she stepped into the Nightwish tour. In fact, I had only discovered Nightwish about a month before the North America tour started, loved the music, found out they're playing in San Francisco in a few weeks and bought tickets. Then the bomb dropped: new vocalist, she will only be performing with the band for the third time ever at the concert I'm going to. I did not have high expectations.\u000a\u000aLoved the concert. Floor was amazing. Great stage presence, phenomenal voice.
p609
aVThe biggest problem for me is that she absolutely cannot nail Amaranth. Her voice just can't get it, so she cheats.

p617

VI think they've used the same audio from *Showtime, Storytime* here, or at least it sounds like it. Especially at the end, Floor's singing doesn't quite match up with what you hear.\u000a\u000aI do quite enjoy these videos, but there doesn't seem much point to them if we keep getting songs they've already had videos of before!
p619
aVMmh the intro ("It was the night before ...") sounds different though !\u000a\u000aBut agree, would have liked to have official videos for songs we have no live version yet !
p620
aVI've been noticing they've been using different audio mixes for these videos. For example, in Planet Hell they've used a completely different audio mix because Floor didn't start belting that song until later on the tour. I wonder why they've been doing this. 
p621
aVThat's interesting, good spot!
p622
aVThe audio quality from 'Showtime, Storytime' seems a lot better. This sounds muffled, or something.
p623
aVYeah I tried listening to one and then the other - the Showtime Storytime version sounded the same but a lot better quality, weirdly. I sort of wonder if they mixed it with the audio of the actual video in order to get some of the crowd sounds and stuff.
p624
aVI don't care that it MIGHT be the same audio. This left me speechless the first time I heard it with Floor. She's exactly what the mad genius Tuomas needs in nightwish. Powerful but not cocky. And the voice, my god...she trills, she belts it, she KICKS ASS.\u000a\u000aFloor Jansen is my hero for bringing back a Nightwish I want to listen to.\u000a\u000a(But Marco is still my favourite)

p629
aVThey don't have a pre-order up on their official web shop yet, and I'm almost 100% sure they will have some kind of really nice bundle for pre-order soon. I'm personally holding out for that. I don't even care how expensive it is, it's worth it to me, this honestly sounds like it'll be their best album ever!
p630
aVI want the EARBOOK mainly for the instrumental album. $54 AUD for the non-deluxe. Worth it, although the deluxe version sounds really nice as well.
p631
aVYes! I've not got any other of Epica's albums in instrumental so it will be awesome to have that. I love to write to music without vocals. 
p632
aVMy friend travelled overseas just for the release of RFTI and brought me back a signed copy of the instrumental cd. It might have actually gotten more play time than the lyrical album. Like, I love Simone's vocals but damn, the instrumentals are brilliant.\u000a\u000aTQE so far sounds like it's tracks are even better. Just plain heavy, epic sounding instrumentals.

asVNew Nightwish single elan, thoughts?
p646
(lp647
VI have heard the whole album and this's definitely the most "radio friendly" song on it. It's not really a true representation of the album as it is so dynamic and ambitious it's almost like a punch to the face!!! 
p648
aVThe pipes are perfect, so beautiful. But, I did find most other parts of the song to be a bit boring. It never hit in a satisfying way for me, especially the chorus, just staying soft and smooth. Not really my thing.\u000a\u000aOverall, it won't be my favourite song and I probably won't listen to it that much, but I still think it bodes well for the full album, with Floor's voice shining so well. I'm excited!
p649
aVVery different from Imaginaerum, I think it has a touch of the older stuff which is totally not what I was expecting, but I like it anyway! Can't wait to hear the rest of it.
p650
aVThe intro melody and chord progression is giving me a very strong Amorphis vibe, especially [Heaven of my Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtdfQPEjTRw)\u000a\u000aAs far as the song itself - I think it makes sense as the first single. Catchy, short, accessible. That said, I really like it and it has definitely gotten me more excited for the album! I like how Floor pulls back and isn't required to belt everything at 110%. 
p651
aVI really like it.  I want to hear her belting it out live.  After seeing the Wacken 2013 clips I fell in love lol.  All it's missing is a guitar solo :)\u000a\u000aDefinitely got me excited for the new album.
p652
aVI'm on my second listen. The verses are really lovely - they've made the best of Floor's soft vocals. The chorus isn't getting me yet but I've heard that it gets stuck in your head. I don't think this is going to be a big hit but it's certainly a sweet and enjoyable song.
p653
aVBought it on iTunes and had a listen. Gave me goosebumps although I think part of that came from the thrill of listening to it after all the anticipation and waiting for it.\u000a\u000aI honestly do like it though.\u000a\u000aI get the feeling that it was chosen as the first release specifically to put the new members of the band forward. Of course, Floor Jansen is front and center. Troy's pipes are an integral part of the song but you can hear him doing backing vocals as well. Absolutely no complaints about Kai Hahto's drumming.\u000a\u000aI'm looking forward to the full album.
p654
aVInstrumentally it's insanely boring, just muted chords through the entire song, bass doing nothing extra, really vanilla drum beat and synth not really bringing much to the table. \u000a\u000aI get the idea, calm collected song that's showing off the soft side of both the band and the new singer but I'm not really feeling anything special with this song. There's nothing extra, it's just simple and plain all throughout the entire song. I kept expecting it to go that extra bit towards the end and really bring it but nope, just another soft chorus where they barely made the effort to spice it up a bit.\u000a\u000aMaybe it's just serving it's spot as a soft filler as some have said but man.. It's a really bland and boring song and I really hope the rest of the album really is as different and interesting as the people who got a taste of it says.\u000a
p655
asVNow that we're half way through 2014, what are your favorite albums released so far?
p656
(lp657
VQuantum Enigma by a long way. There's plenty of great stuff that's been released but TQE is just incredible.
p658
aVI really liked The Quantum Enigma and Sacrificium. However, the album that surprised me the most has to be Argia by Diabulus In Musica. I wasn't really expecting much when I decided to give it a listen, but it really blew me away. 
p659
aVWow, Argia is surprisingly good! Thanks for mentioning it, wouldn't have known about it else.
p660
aVYeah it surprised me too. I'm glad you liked it!
p661
aVI'd say The Quantum Enigma is technically the best album I've heard this year while Life And Times of Scrooge is the one I enjoy most emotionally (if that makes sense). That album is just so beautiful.\u000a\u000aI've also really enjoyed The Human Contradiction and Sacrificium. I'm mixed on Hydra but I've listened to it a lot and I do really like most of the songs.
p662
aVThis thread has convinced me to download TQE. 
p663
aVIt would be sacrilege if you didn't at least give it a proper listen. I think you'll enjoy it.
p664
aVDesign Your Universe was the last Epica album I downloaded. I just went on an itunes spree and got the last 2 Epica, new Sonata Arctica and Life and Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. My commute home will be fun this afternoon.
p665
aVMy top three albums of the year, regardless of genre, are actually all symphonic metal (although fusions): New Whispered, Ancient Bards and Mechina albums 
p666
aVI'm not sure if you guys consider symphonic death in this sub, but if so Septicflesh - Titan is my favorite symphonic release of the year (so far).\u000a\u000aOtherwise it's a tie between The Quantum Enigma and Sacrificium. 
p667
aVThis thread convinced me also to get TQE a few days ago and, having listened to it, I'll go with (in order or preference) Hydra, The Quantum Enigma, and Sacrificium as my three favorite 2014 albums thus far.
p668
aVLike the others, Quantum Enigma. Still listening to it daily. Then again, I got into Epica only a few weeks before the release of TQE, so I've been binging on Epica since then.  
p669
aVQuantum Enigma, Hydra, and Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck for sure. Those are my top 3 so far, easily.
p670
aVLike most others, I'd have to say: TQE then Hydra, Sacrificium, and A New Dawn Ending. I'm kinda new to the genre, so I've been getting into each band one at a time over the past few months.
p671
aVEquilibrium's new album, Erdentempel, is stunning. But I'm going to have to follow the crowd on this and say The Quantum Enigma is the running champion. It's became my workout CD.\u000a\u000aA few honorable mentions from my list: \u000a"Shogunate Macabre" by Whispered (melodic death)\u000a"Xenon" by Mechina (melodic death)\u000a"Lore of Lies" by Lorelei (symphonic deathcore)\u000a"We Are All Sinners" by Upon This Dawning (symphonic metalcore)\u000a"Phantom" by Betraying the Martyrs (also, symphonic deathcore)\u000a\u000aSymphonic deathcore/metalcore is a guilty pleasure of mine. I apologize in advance.
p672
aVHydra is more consistent quality-wise to me, but The Quantum Enigma peaks a lot better than Hydra does.
p673
asVTrans Siberian Orchestra?

VI really like Christmas Eve / Sarajevo. Seems to be a staple for them. 
p676
aVA Mad Russian's Christmas is pretty awesome too.
p677
aVI've been to their concerts several times - in my opinion they're spectacular and I absolutely love them. The performers love to interact with the audience. It's a super fun show and a good time for all. I would highly recommend seeing them if you have the chance. 
p678
aVI'm going to see them for the fifth times when they come to Chicago. The concerts are a lot of fun. A lot of special effects and they put on a great show with a ton of talent. It blows my mind that they put on two shows a day and still do autographs for free after the show. I don't know how they do it. Tickets are worth every penny and if you can pick one up do it. 
p679
aVThey do an awesome live show, and it's kinda fun to see young kids and old ladies alike turning out for what is effectively a symphonic metal/rock concert. Last time I went to see them in Milwaukee or Chicago about 5 years ago the first half of their act was basically a rather-dull concept album, but the second half of the show more than made up for it. Definitely worth the trip. 
p680
aVI really enjoy the album Beethoven's Last Night. I listened to those before I started listening to Therion.

p704
aVVery pretty song. I could chillax to this.
p705
aVI wish Tuomas endeavoured something more orchestral but I would say now isn't the time for a larger scale project like that with Floor joining Nightwish and everything. \u000a\u000aI'm excited to see how the rest of the album will turn out. This is definitely on the pop side of symphonic metal and it does have it's charm but I hope Tuomas has more in store for us in the rest of the album
p706
aVI honestly don't think the album will be metal at all. It will probably more of a soundtrack/orchestral release. 
p707
aVLithium0992 is correct, the album isn't really intended to be symphonic metal. It's supposed to be a soundtrack to the Scrooge McDuck book, so it will be more like film music. I think there will be more orchestra on other tracks but also there will also be a heavy folk influence from what I've heard (like Last of the Wilds) and some tracks will have no vocals.

aVI agree. The jumping can be a little wonky and sometimes the audio for some vocal tracks cut out seemingly before they're supposed to, but they're minor issues. The game is fun and the story is great so far.

aVthis is a must see for every nightwish fan.  its heartbreaking when the camera focuses on a single member of the band thats not tarja, you can just tell theyre struggling with the thought of whats going to happen as soon as they step off stage.  regardless, its easily one of if not the best live performance theyve ever done.
p729
aVThe beginning of Ever Dream when Tuomas just stops playing and has to compose himself. So many feels.

p732
aVGhost Love Score live is amazing.
p733
aVIt's really interesting to watch now and see each one of the members demeanors during the show. Knowing what happens after.
p734
aVI've always had a somewhat negative memory of Tarja's live singing, probably due to the crappy recordings serving as B-side on Over the Hills and Far Away. Glad to be proved wrong!
p735
aV*End of an Era* was a great concert. Crazy to think how they fired Tarja right after it. This was my favourite Nigthwish album until *Showtime, Storytime* came around!\u000a
p736
aVEvery time I watch that, when the camera pans to the words "once I had a dream and this is it" up on the stage, it sends shivers down my spine.

asVEpica's latest photoshoot for their new album "TQE"

(lp741
VThey had two photo shoots for their upcoming album. This picture is a sneak preview.
p742
aVFrom their Facebook, right?\u000a\u000aTo be honest, it kinda hurts my eyes - ghosting and foreground blur makes it rather difficult to focus on. But I guess there's a reason for it that will become apparent once the album theme/title is revealed. 
p743
aVYeah it's from their facebook. I feel the same way; there's obviously a reason for it and maybe the album title is reflected in such a way (The Quintessential Existence?, The Quasi Equilibrium?, etc.)
p744
aVThe photoshoot was by Tim Tronckoe, who did their Retrospect photos. He's photographed tons of symphonic metal singers and bands, and is resident photographer for MFVF. He also has a twin, which is really confusing when you think you're seeing the same guy walking past in different outfits...

p759
aVThat's a shame - at least the box set comes with signatures!
p760
aVYeah. They were nearby too close to Nightwish and i could only swing Kamelot or Nightwish this time due to timing. Chose Nightwish.
p761
aVGood choice, I would say! I reckon there are more chances to see Kamelot than there are to see Nightwish.
p762
aVI have the USA purple double vinyl ordered. Bummer it won't be signed. Perhaps I'll be able to get sigs when they play here in Denver! So... Long... To... Wait...\u000a\u000aConsidering how big this album is going to be, I'm really surprised they didn't sell out the limited editions right away. 
p763
aVI think the fact that there's so many editions to choose from is one reason why they haven't sold out yet - though the wooden box set was showing only 4 left on the site yesterday.

VI am very much looking forward to the new album. Based on this and "Paradise", I like the direction they're going.
p769
aVIt could just be my speakers, but I think the vocals could be brought out a bit more - as is, you kind of have to strain your ears to make out the details of the vocals.\u000a\u000aBut otherwise, catchy and fun!
p770
aVYes the guitars are a little loud in this mix, if you turn up the volume a bit it helps with clarity.
p771
aVIt's a change from the songs where you could barely tell they were guitars if nothing else.
p772
aVI like the song alright, the longer vocal section 3/4 of the way through was nice, but overall the song doesn't stand out much for me from their previous work.\u000a\u000aOdd video.
p773
aVAgreed, at least at the moment. I have a tendency to not really like WT songs on first listen (despite them being one of my absolute favourite bands) and then end up loving them later on. \u000a\u000aThe video is pretty weird, I get the idea that they wanted to show people doing dangerous stuff but it's all quite disjointed.

VHuh. Interesting. I thought the track titles were really weird, but those interpretations/explanations make sense.\u000a\u000aThough it's strange seeing so many direct references to literature and whatnot. It's really different from Tuomas's usual MO.
p787
aVThis definitely seems way different. I've very excited to hear it. The direct reference to the NatGeo cover is particularly interesting, I don't know that I've heard him directly reference a real event like that besides Kinslayer and Columbine.\u000a\u000aAlso you can tell Greatest Show is the long one for sure since it got a whole side to itself on the vinyl release!
p788
aV25 minutes? Holy crap, I knew this album would have their longest song yet, but I thought it would only be 14-15 minutes. They really outdid themselves on this album.
p789
aVI'm a fan of long songs and I basically only like 2 songs that are greater than 20 minutes: [*The Great Escape*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq2qa1YTquI) by Seventh Wonder and [*Black Rose Immortal*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74VTf9RypfU) by Opeth.  \u000a\u000aHopefully *The Greatest Show on Earth* is number 3 and I hope not too much of it is speaking. 
p790
aVHave you heard [Light of Day, Day of Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWpwC1p-Ilw)?.\u000a\u000aThat's one of my favorite songs of all time. It's a beautiful masterpiece.\u000a\u000aAlso, Opeth is indeed awesome, though Black Rose Immortal isn't among my favorites (I prefer their 10-14 minute tracks, like Blackwater Park, Deliverance, Harlequin Forest, Hessian Peel, Moon Above Sun Below and a few other long songs).
p791
aVI have not, but I'll be sure to give it a proper listen when I get home.    \u000a\u000aI definitely agree on the Opeth songs, I also prefer the ~10 min songs.
p792
aVBlack Rose Immortal has an interesting beat to it, but I'm a little iffy on the harsh vocals. Their texture(?) just doesn't appeal that much to me, I guess is how I would describe it.\u000a\u000aThe Great Escape, on the other hand, was amazing, and looking at the lyrics, is just completely sad (emotionally, not quality-wise), how it portrays the hopelessness in that situation and everything. 
p793
aVYeah, the harsh vocals were a little hard to get into when I first started listening to Opeth. Black Rose Immortal is from their second album and their music was a lot more harsh then (they don't have growls or make metal anymore, just prog rock), but Opeth is very diverse in their music.  \u000a\u000aI'm glad you liked The Great Escape. I love that song too. I've probably listened to it over 50 times and every time it seems to get shorter! 
p794
aVWait, did they ever confirm a 25-minute track? This is the first time I'm hearing about it. Sounds awesome.
p795
aVPip Williams (who does the orchestration) tweeted a lot about there being an epic and long closing track in 5 parts. I think it was Mape Ollila (Nightwish's biographer) who was the first to say it was 25 minutes long. I don't know if there's been any official confirmation from the band of the exact length of the track, though.

p821
aVThey've been working on a purely orchestral album since the late 90s, which will hopefully finally come out this year. Wheel of Time was actually originally composed for the orchestral project, but I guess it didn't fit with the rest of the material, so they turned it into the song on At the Edge of Time instead. I'm pretty sure they're planning to release a new regular album in addition to the orchestral one. I'm unreasonably excited for both!

aVSilent scream came out in 2009 IIRC. It was a good album. I hope this new one will be better. 
p831
aVI'd heard of them but not listened before, so thanks for the suggestion!
p832
aVThanks for making this list. Looks like a lot of awesome stuff coming out.
p833
aVSystem Divide's "Cult of Indifference" is one I'm really looking forward to after a couple of delays (Summer-Fall 2014, unconfirmed as they took down the original posting of their planned date). They're adding orchestrations to their style, and it sounds really brutal in my opinion.\u000a\u000aTo the unfamiliar, System Divide is extreme/technical death metal with gothic influences. I think. \u000a\u000aHere's their single off the album:\u000ahttp://youtu.be/cphwskBdJYc
p834
aVCheers, added! I didn't know they were adding symphonic elements, that's interesting.
p835
aVCan you move the System Divide from the already released column? I was excited, went looking for the album and instead found it was never released and they're on indefinite hiatus now. \u000aUnless it was released as a demo or something. Otherwise it's nowhere to be found. 
p836
aVApologies, I had no idea. When I last checked I saw it was down for a March release date, now I've just seen on their page that they're on hiatus - they were due to play my nearest city, turns out the promoters didn't tell anyone they'd pulled out so I missed that too. I'll put it back into upcoming with a note about the hiatus.
p837
aVAdded details for Delain and Diabulus In Musica. Also I've stickied the post for now so hopefully it will be easy for people to access the list.

aVI had my suspicions that they might play this from when it was played in the background of the announcement video, but I didn't really dare to hope that it would actually happen! I almost thought that Tarja had cancelled the duet because it didn't happen until the very end of the show, and she said "I believe I promised you something"...

VThis is the post made on the band's official Facebook page (and the one I linked to):\u000a\u000a&gt;As you may have heard there has been some upset in the band over the last 24 hours but we'd like to say that we all stand by our new album 100% and we'll be making a more official statement shortly. Emily and the band thank you for your continued love and support.\u000a\u000aOnly one week ago the band posted that their new album only needs a few final tweaks to be done. Everyone was really enthusiastic about their new album and all seemed fine, until yesterday. It seems pretty obvious that the argument is between lead singer Emily Alice Ovenden and at least three of the other band members.\u000a\u000aMarc Dyos, founding member and drummer for Pythia, posted:\u000a\u000a&gt;You can appreciate just how bad the situation has become when I am walking away from the band I created, on the brink of the release of our best album to date, but unfortunately a long-standing unprofessional and unreasonable presence within the band has ruined what was a strong, positive and rising force. Indeed, it is that particular presence within the band that has \u2018blocked\u2019 all other members of Pythia from accessing Pythia pages and accounts. \u000a\u000aAnd he signed off with this, leaving out the vocalist:\u000a\u000a&gt;it is my hope that I can again work with Ross, Oz, Mark, and Marcus.\u000a\u000aTwo hours later guitarist Ross White announced his departure saying "the reasons are the same" and said that bassist Mark Harrington has resigned too.\u000a\u000aIs Pythia breaking up? Founding member Ross White calls the upcoming Pythia album their final one in his Facebook status.\u000a\u000atl;dr: Three members of Pythia (at minimum) depart the band, the future of Pythia is unclear
p900
aVI saw a festival organiser saying he couldn't book them because "it looks like they're disbanding" - not sure if that was just a guess or if he's been told that the band are fully splitting up. A lot of people have pointed out that their statement refers to "Emily and the band" so it seems likely that they've fallen out with Emily.

aVFrom what I've been able to find their Wikipedia page [has been deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Pythia_\u005c(band\u005c)) for a lack of reliable sources. 
p903
aVWoah, that seems a little harsh. I thought they were a fairly well-known band in the genre. I mean, they just supported Leaves' Eyes on tour here. And I've seen them covered in big magazines like Metal Hammer and Terrorizer. Seems weird that the Wiki guys couldn't find anything on them.

aVWhat? Do you have a source for this?
p975
aVI read about it in the book but here's a mention of it on [Tuomas's official site](http://www.tuomas-holopainen.com/en/diary/319-the-mcduck-demo-is-ready):\u000a\u000a"As some of you might remember, Nemo was originally over 6.30 long, much more up-tempo, with a duet-rap part with Tarja and Marco in the C-part (!!) Hah! Tero was the one to open my locked-up, stubbornly stuffy ears with that one." 
p976
aVI can't believe it. That could have been bad. That song was what got me into Nightwish, and its still one of my favorites. I can't imagine that would have turned out well.
p977
aVThis video series has been fun to watch. Really excited for the next album!
p978
aVNightwish was one of my all-time favorite bands. Once Anette joined, I stopped listening. I never bashed her but she just didn't do it for me. Once Floor joint, I didn't even know since I removed myself from anything to do with the band since it was just a Anette vs Tarja with fans. It's like Gabriel and Collins all over again and I don't like that.\u000a\u000aBut once I did stumble upon Nightwish with the new singer, Floor. I was "Floored" &gt;.&lt; I honestly thinks she fits better than Tarja ever did. She performs amazing live compared to Anette or Tarja and is just so powerful in every aspect. Anyways I can't wait to hear what is next!
p979
aVI don't know many symphonic metal fans, but do people actually think Anette is a better fit for Nightwish than Tarja? That is just downright idiotic. 
p980
aVVery few people ever said that Anette was better than Tarja, usually just the other way around. But a lot of people (myself included) were perfectly happy with Anette as the singer at the time (and I certainly know a whole bunch of people who preferred her, especially if they didn't like operatic vocals). Tuomas once described Tarja's voice as like a "cold mountain stream" while Anette was like a "warm storyteller". That was a great analogy for me. I enjoyed them both equally.\u000a\u000aHaving said that, Floor is my favourite vocalist now, hands down.
p981
aVNo. I haven't heard of people who preferred her and though she was a great hit. Floor, for me, is a great fit and I honestly prefer her over anyone else.
p982
aVOP, how did you find this video? It's unlisted on youtube, I didn't get it in my subbox.
p983
aVIt was posted on Nightwish's Facebook 8 hours ago. It seems to be a trend these days to make videos unlisted until the band are ready to share. Sometimes it's for exclusivity, sometimes I think it's just so they can upload it ahead of time.

aVJansen is great but Epica is still lightyears behind nightwish musically ( not from an execution point just from an actual musical complexity point.) Jansen is still a guitar player first and it leads to a very guitar driven sound for epica. Tuomas is a composer.

(lp1050
VHi! I'm English and I went to the festival last year. I didn't find the language barrier to be too much of a problem, at my hotel and the festival most people spoke at least a little English if not more. \u000a\u000aIn general I thought the festival was awesome, especially since it's a lot cheaper than UK ones. It's in one big hall with merch stalls and a bar at the back and various food vans outside - they have a barbecue, pasta, pizza, fries etc. They don't mind you bringing food and drink inside which is a big plus. If you shell out for a VIP ticket you can go to the VIP bar behind the stage where you can meet lots of the bands - almost everyone except the headliners walked through at some point while I was there. This also could be good if you go on your own because lots of people sit back there and chat. If you can't get VIP, you can also go to the signing table - again, almost all of the bands were there signing at some point in the weekend.\u000a\u000aI'm not a big expert on the fest because I've only been once, but I'm happy to answer any more questions that you have. :)
p1051
aVHow much would you say it cost for the whole event?
p1052
aVHmm, I'm struggling to remember... I think it was about £100 each for VIP tickets (apparently the VIP tickets have changed price but the normal ones are the same, about £70/$115) and a couple of hundred for the hotel.

asVMy Guide To Epica: Their best songs and albums.
p1072
(lp1073
VI think the Phantom Agony was some of Epica's best lyrical work. \u000a\u000a* Sensorium looks into the seeming futility of life and the search for meaning \u000a* While vague, Cry for the Moon is an interesting criticism of the Catholic Church and child abuse \u000a* Facade of Reality is a sharp criticism of radical Islam and the resulting 9/11 attacks on the United States\u000a* The Phantom Agony discusses deep epistemological problems of what we can know about reality\u000a\u000aAnd there are other songs with strong lyrics as well. It's not their strongest album musically, but I've always considered the lyrics a strength.  
p1074
aVI think you are confusing what I meant. Their use of language is rather bland.   I'm not criticizing the message behind their work, just their way with words. If you look at their work from the recent years they have improved exponentially at expressing themselves lyrically. I love their message.
p1075
aVOkay, I can see what you mean. Some of the wording is a little clunky.
p1076
aVThe Phantom Agony without ... The Phantom Agony ?\u000a\u000aNever been to interested in criticism, but do people really don't like The Phantom Agony and Facade of Reality ? :o

p1092
(lp1093
sVSo why did Amberian Dawn remake all their music with Heidi Parviainen?
p1094
(lp1095
VThe way I see it, is that the way that the old songs were written and produced, Heidi's vocal range fit the part. However, Heidi's vocal range has been narrow at the times of recordings, and I can only assume that she left because she had no more to offer after The End of Eden and Circus Black.\u000a\u000aWhen they hired Capri as replacement, in my opinion, they were looking for a different and more tough sound. Heidi couldn't achieve that. They rewrote some of the old songs to, maybe, showcase her voice as Capri's vocal range is wider and heavier (and a little more refined in my opinion).\u000a\u000aHowever, I can understand why people don't like it. It's a large change to the lineup and writing style than what they're used to. Maybe when they come out with an album or two with Capri, you may be more impressed. Or not. Who knows?\u000a\u000aI admire Capri's and Heidi's vocal talent. If I had to choose, though, I am a bigger fan of Capri's style and range.
p1096
aVYea she's not a bad singer and I would probably add different songs they do, but not the remakes. I can't listen to them without wanting to listen to the other version.
p1097
aVI think they were mostly showcasing the new singer's voice, although I'm not a big fan of it. Hopefully it's better when the music's written for her but it seems like she has no range at all and almost has a lisp.
p1098
aVI don't like to be too dramatic about this sort of thing, but honestly I thought it was quite insulting to Heidi to re-record the songs. But who knows, perhaps Heidi agreed that they could do it? In any case, I'll be sticking with the original versions, and I'm happy to listen to any new songs with Capri. She has a good rock voice.
p1099
aVI absolutely love Capri's voice, it's more rock oriented.  No disrespect to Heidi, but I couldn't get into the band with the over the top dramatic operatic vocals.  I feel the same way about Nightwish, I prefer Anette and Floor.

VObligatory *The Quantum Enigma.*
p1106
aVYup. TQE is number 1 followed by (MaYaN) Antagonise followed by (Delain) The Human Contradiction. Some excellent sound quality/mastering this year. 
p1107
aVI actually didn't like "The Quantum Enigma" and I am a huge Epica fan. I'm a lot more into the "The Phantom Agony" / "Consign to Oblivion" albums. 
p1108
aV's cool bro. We all have different tastes.
p1109
aVIt's weird. I like that band so much and I really want to like the new album, but I just don't. Still I don't regret buying it.
p1110
aVI have a similar issue... I like the album but don't love it the way I did with previous albums... The darkness and balance of growls/singing from the previous 5 albums seems to be missing, even though the performance quality and mastering is probably their best yet. I guess it's pretty fresh and as close to a "happy" album as symphonic metal can get... just such a big stylistic shift that I like it but don't really relate to it as much... \u000a\u000aAlso, the other main reason I didn't like TQE as much as previous albums is all the formulaic songwriting (e.g. verse-chorus form) getting used on half the songs, and the choruses that are so... not-heavy. Still better than anything on the radio today though! 
p1111
aVThe Quantum Enigma, and nothing else even comes close.\u000a\u000aBut here's my ranked list of relevant 2014 albums:\u000a\u000aThe Quantum Enigma (Epica) &gt; Antagonise (MaYaN) &gt; Serenades of the Netherworld (HDK) &gt; Hydra (Within Temptation) &gt; Sacrificium (Xandria) &gt; The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck (Tuomas Holopainen).\u000a\u000aHonorable mention for Diablo Swing Orchestra's Jigsaw Hustle single, since it's their only release this year (I want their new album ASAP).
p1112
aVGlad to see mention of Scrooge here. I find that record charming, compelling, and beautiful.
p1113
aV1\u005c. **Epica** - *The Quantum Enigma*\u000a\u000aThere can be no doubt about this one. [*The Essence of Silence*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oePrtEMmX9Y) is among my favourite symphonic metal songs of all time. [*Utopa Unchained*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8y99z5EVtY) and [*Natural Corruption*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YjUFXebjp8) are other highlights of this superb album.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a2\u005c. **Delain** - *The Human Contradiction*\u000a\u000a[*Your Body Is a Battleground*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKZgAVygp9A) and [*Tell Me, Mechanist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrOaDZJ78ws) are two of my favourites on this one. Delain makes symphonic metal of the more mainstream, less complex variety. \u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a3\u005c. **Alestorm** - *Sunset on the Golden Age*\u000a\u000aThe [titular track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFpwIEfxBP4) is my favourite song on this album. Don't listen to Alestorm if you're looking for traditional symphonic power metal (Nightwish, Epica, Kamelot). Alestorm writes in a variety of metal genres and only some of their songs are symphonic metal.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aI have very high expectations of the following albums based on the previous work by these bands, but I haven't listened to them yet. Really looking forward to these:\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a?. **Pythia** - [*Shadows of a Broken Past*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ6e1ibOd40)\u000a\u000a?. **Xandria** - [*Sacrificium*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y)\u000a\u000a?. **MaYaN** - [*Antagonise*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OypT6Cj6qU)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aAnd then there were these albums. They were okay, but I wouldn't put them in my favourites for the year:\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a?. **Within Temptation** - [*Hydra*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy6MpsDPKts)\u000a\u000a?. **Within Temptation** - [*Let Us Burn: Elements and Hydra Live*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFvxWUFwECw)\u000a\u000a?. **Tarja** - [*Left in the Dark*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFO5W4hSTDs)\u000a\u000a?. **Tarja** - [*Beauty and the Beat*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XoJFEkWa6k)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000a*Hydra* had a couple of decent songs (*Paradise*, *Silver Moonlight*) but I can't help but feel that Within Temptation used to be so much better. The live double album has its moments, especially the *Elements* half.\u000a\u000aTarja's albums are only partially symphonic metal. Her singing is sublime and her band is extremely talented, but there's just not enough metal for me. It's the same problem Within Temptation has, only worse.
p1114
aVI wouldn't think that this sub would like it that much, but Sunset on the Golden Age is an incredible album. Alestorm is a really underrated band.
p1115
aV*We came here to drink your beer,\u000aAnd steal your rum at the point of a gun,\u000aYour alcohol to us will fall,\u000a'Cause we came here to drink your beer!*

aVI agree with everyone else that *The Quantum Enigma* is easily the best of 2014. However, I think *Argia* by Diabulus in Musica deserves an honorable mention. An excellent symphonic album by a not too popular band. 
p1117
aV/u/Archanoth says it all:\u000a\u000a&gt; The Quantum Enigma, and nothing else even comes close.\u000a\u000aSimone's voice has definitely gotten a lot more powerful, at least when compared to the last album.

aV1. Sacrificium (Xandria)\u000a2. The Quantum Enigma (Epica)\u000a3. The Human Contradiction (Delain)\u000a\u000aI hadn't really followed Xandria up until now, but despite the fact that Epica is generallly my favorite band I find myself listening to Sacrificium more and more. TQE is a very close second for sure though. \u000a\u000aHonorable mention to *Massive Addictive* (Amaranthe). It might not really be symphonic but I can't leave it off a list of top albums in 2014.
p1120
aVI liked Hydra (Within Temptation) although it does seem to skew a lot from their past albums and I see why people didn't like it as much, I prefer the mainstream symphonic metal so it was good for me\u000a\u000aI also thought The Human Contradiction (Delain) was good. I liked a few songs on the album including Stardust, Your Body Is A Battleground, Army of Dolls, and My Masquerade.\u000a\u000aI really only have experience with those two bands and some Epica, but based on what i've seen here I should really check out The Quantum Enigma.
p1121
aVThe Quantum Enigma gets my vote. Epica never fail to impress. It's been on repeat in my car since May! \u000a\u000aHonourable mentions: Hydra -WT, The Human Contradiction - Delain and Origins - Eluveitie (though that's not Symphonic metal!) 
p1122
aVFor me is the debut album of Savn. Its nice to have some of the members of The sins of thy beloved back.
p1123
aVI completely forgot about this one, even though it is quite a good debut indeed! 
p1124
aVThe Quantum Enigma (Epica) and Shogunate Macabre (Whispered) are definitely on my list.\u000a\u000aHowever, one album that I wish I could let everyone listen to is "Garden of Dystopia" by Divine Disorder. They are melodic death with heavy orchestrated elements, with a few songs composed by Oliver Palotai (Kamelot's keyboardist and composer). I feel it can definitely be a contender for the 2014 symphonic metal album of the year. Though, I feel I am one of the few people - or even only person - in this subreddit who has been able to listen to the album since the release last month. \u000a\u000aI have asked the band if I could post one of their songs to YouTube and link you all to enjoy. Alas, my request was respectfully denied (likely due to some legal reasons, but it is unclear). The songs they had put up on YouTube have been re-recorded for their album.
p1125
aVSadly, I have yet to listen to Epica's new album, but since it was so highly praised i will have to check it out. What surprises me is that no one has mentioned Stream of Passions's album A War of our Own. It was absolutely brilliant! Hydra was an okay album, but Within Temptation has become a little too poppy for my tastes recently, although there were a couple really good songs.
p1126
aVAs much as I love *The Quantum Enigma*, I'd say it was only my second favourite album of the year. My top favourite has to be *The Life and Times of Scrooge*. I just think it's amazingly beautiful and something quite different to anything else I own, though it still has that Nightwish feel. Whilst TQE is a really high standard and just a brilliant record, I find TLATOS evocative and emotional. It's sort of achieved that other level of perfect music for me.
p1127
aVPersonally I think this year was really weak in terms of new releases. *The Quantum Enigma* and the Holopainen's project were the only noteworthy ones, and I wouldn't call either of them truly brilliant. \u000a\u000aAn honorary mention for a nice semi-symphonic work goes to *Erdentempel* by Equilibrium.

p1163
(lp1164
VI like Stream of Passion, and I own all of their albums. In my opinion, each new album is better than the previous one although they are all good. I really like "Darker Days" and the recently released "A War of Our Own". I think the band is more like Within Temptation or Delain than Xandria or Epica. Marcela's vocals are always beautiful and clean (not pseudo-operatic like Epica or Xandria though), and she occasionally sings in Spanish.\u000a\u000aHere are links to youtube playlists to listen for yourself: \u000a\u000a"Embrace the Storm" Album Playlist:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwtbRmkG5jU&amp;list=PL06D82A284794DE62\u000a\u000a"The Flame Within" Album Playlist.\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFSBYRlYq8g&amp;list=PL3DD4C58AEDEDA362\u000a\u000a"Darker Days" Album Playlist:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nzRCJnumNY&amp;list=PLjoyJiXc-d6A1JGqvOwXbGYCmw9k2f9zt&amp;index=1\u000a\u000aA War of Our Own Music Video (Full album hasn't been uploaded yet):\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09bj7MvTgLE\u000a\u000aThe first album "Embrace the Storm" is considerably different (most notably softer) from the rest.

aVThank you! I'm also a huge fan of Within Temptation and Delain so I think I'll like Stream of Passion. I think I'll skip "Embrace the Storm" for now and maybe come back to it. I think I'll start with "The Flame Within" and go on from there, especially if they tend to get better with every new album.   \u000a\u000aEdit: I just listened to "The Flame Within" and I really liked it. Marcela has a beautiful voice. I think I'm really going to like the next two albums.

aVI really like their [Perpetual Desolation Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN0nbxFQPxY) show. As for the awesome violin, you probably already know that Pete Johansen went on to play with Tristania - which is part of the reason why the earlier Tristania albums are so much better than their later ones.

(lp1234
VThat was a lot of fun! :D
p1235
aVThat was well done. I still wish Tarja was in the band, her voice lends itself well to the gothic feel of the band. The new singer I found brought a more celtic feel, and with that sound it felt more rock oriented than symphonic metal. 
p1236
aVI really liked Anette Olzon.  I think I am in the minority.  Amaranth is my favorite song they have.\u000a\u000aFloor Jansen has gorgeous vocals, though.  I am really looking forward to their next album.
p1237
aVThough there was always a very vocal group of Anette haters, *Dark Passion Play* was the band's best selling album and *Imaginaerum* sold well too, so I think there are a lot more fans than the internet would have you think!
p1238
aVI really like Anette too, or at least Nightwishe's style with her, but Elize has a very similar 'pop' voice as Anette, but she has much more range, power and emotion. [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DbAruY9z-w#t=34) and [live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UmePt9RSLbc#t=22).\u000a\u000aAnd like someone else mentioned she has performed in bands before and never had to make any cancellations, I have no idea why they chose Anette over her.
p1239
aVI do like Amaranthe.  I got their new album, Nexus.
p1240
aVI'm really curious who they'll go with next.\u000a\u000aEdit: Oh I just saw on Wikipedia that Floor is going to be a permanent replacement. Next album is due 2015.
p1241
aVThat is actually a good fit. Floor has a voice a little more suited to their sort of style. [Is this her?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V_eoR6r1Tw) Because she can sing their old songs with a sort of delicate grandeur that the previous singer couldn't. \u000a\u000aEdit: The further I get into this song the more I believe she is what Nightwish has needed for a while.

aVLove that drum solo!  I listened to this track far too many times in college; it's a pity Rullo doesn't get to go wild like this in the band's other stuff.\u000a\u000aThe "Lacrymosa" part itself doesn't really grab me, though.  It feels tacked on, and they don't really deliver on the part everybody wants to hear, sort of like covering Handel's *Messiah* and not doing the Halleluja chorus.\u000a\u000a(PS: /u/SymphonicSundays is my account, and I always appreciate recommendations)

asVThoughts on After Forever?
p1293
(lp1294
VI don't think it's really fair to compare Simone to Floor, since Floor's voice is way more powerful.\u000a\u000aStill, Epica are amazing live and have a great stage presence and a very charismatic attitude, which helps a lot, even if technically they don't live up to the higher standards (which I think is mostly due to the music being extremely loud when they play live, which overshadows and drowns out their vocal presence).\u000a\u000aBut yeah, After Forever is a very interesting band, because they're almost like 2 different bands, and they're sort of the symphonic metal equivalent of Tristania.\u000a\u000aDuring the time Mark Jansen was in the band (before they kicked him out), they were essentially proto-Epica. Mark's influence on the songwriting, lyrical themes and atmosphere was incredibly obvious, to a point where it was probably suffocating and restricting Sander and Floor's creative freedoms.\u000a\u000aPrison of Desire and Decipher and pretty great albums, and they share a similar style to The Phantom Agony from Epica (and arguably The Divine Conspiracy, to a small degree).\u000a\u000aPost-Decipher AF, however, is hugely different. They shifted from that sort of symphonic gothic power metal thing they had going on to a much more symphonic progressive metal sound with lots of electronic/industrial elements to it.\u000a\u000aWhile that made them a much more interesting and unique band compared to the rest of the genre (and later ended up influencing Epica with some of these new elements, which you can notice somewhat on Design Your Universe and Requiem for the Indifferent), the songwriting turned out to be very hit-and-miss.\u000a\u000aInvisible Circles is a masterpiece, in my opinion, though I'm biased towards concept albums. Amazingly done overall, great concept, great lyrics, incredible vocal performances, melodies and a great chaotic/hectic pace with female vocals, growls, clean male vocals and choirs all creating a very dynamic and fresh feeling.\u000a\u000aThe worst part about it, as many people usually mention, are the narrative voiceovers, which were badly acted and interrupted the flow of the songs (and the album itself to some degree), which sort of ruined the album for a bunch of people, though I don't see it as a major flaw.\u000a\u000aRemagine, however, was disappointing. And it's an album I really wanted to like. Aside from the fugly album cover, the album itself is full of boring/filler songs, has that "samey" feel to it where a lot of the songs seem similar and repetitive. That being said, there are some amazing tracks there (Forever, Only Everything, Living Shields, Free of Doubt and No Control are highlights of the album).\u000a\u000aThen we have their self-titled and final album, which was very good overall. Not as great as Invisible Circles, definitely better than Remagine, but it suffered from some of the same issues, mostly the filler track issue.\u000a\u000aIn terms of production it's an awesome album, really heavy, aggressive and the orchestral parts are some of the best I've heard in the genre, but some of the songwriting felt weak and uninspired and didn't take advantage of that potential. Still, that album has Dreamflight in it, which is probably my favorite After Forever song (and there are a few other awesome tracks like Discord and De-Energized).\u000a\u000aSo yeah, basically I find them to be a great band, but also one was that was very inconsistent and never got to forge a strong identity. In the Mark Jansen days it was the Precursor to Epica, and after that, it sort of peaked at Invisible Circles and didn't really evolve or improve afterwards.\u000a\u000aWhile it was unfortunate that they split, it seems like it was for the best, especially since in their open letter they mention not having enough passion or motivation to keep things going.\u000a\u000aThat modern AF vibe is still around though. If you listen to both ReVamp albums, HDK's latest album (Serenades of the Netherworld), and arguably MaYaN (at least the first album, Quarterpast), you still find a lot of bits and elements that are reminiscent of AF. Also, like I mentioned, some of Epica's recent material (Resign to Surrender, Deconstruct, Semblance of Liberty, Internal Warfare, Deter the Tyrant are some of the best examples, I think).\u000a\u000aI still think of AF as one of the best bands in the genre. They're not as good as Epica, which are extremely well-rounded and very competent in every way, but they're possibly the best band from a technical standpoint. At the same time the songwriting was their biggest weakness. Amazing at times, really dull at others.\u000a\u000aThey're sort of the opposite of Nightwish, which I see as a very creative and imaginative band with pretty unique songwriting (at least from a melodic/aesthetic perspective, not necessarily from an instrumental one), but sort of weak from a technical standpoint (though Floor's current presence in the band changes that to some degree).\u000a\u000aHeh, sorry for the wall of text. It's a bad habit.
p1295
aVI read it all... Kudos for being legible in the age of texting and ayy lmaos! I agree very closely with you on what parts of After Forever I like... I can't decide whether Decipher or Invisible Circles is the best album; the former was basically the precursor for all of Epica and Epica-type bands (Diabulus in Musica, MaYaN,) but the latter is more progressive and was probably the defining album of After Forever as a unique band rather than a testing ground for Mark Jansen's songwriting. I like both these albums especially for the live strings and the quality of the performance (except the cheesy vocal parts which always annoy me at the end of Blind Pain... the talking in Between Love and Fire isn't that bad). \u000a\u000aIf Reimagine and Prison of Desire had live strings I would have liked them more... but still not as much as IC or Decipher. The last album was a bit to "poppy" for my tastes but Discord, Withering Time, De-Energized, Dreamflight and maybe one of the others were pretty good.\u000a\u000aI like MaYaN too... the heavier side of symphonic metal is my preferance, which may be why I liked After Forever a lot better than some of the lighter ones like Within Temptation and Nightwish's newer stuff. 
p1296
aVI like both bands. When I saw Epica I thought Simone was absolutely amazing, and in any live video of hers I always think she sings beautifully so I'd like to see a video where you think she is singing poorly live.
p1297
aVCheck out the official Retrospect DVD... the rest of the musicians, choir, band were awesome... poor Simone just kept hitting bad notes, improvising in an almost cringeworthy manner, or singing certain notes quickly as if she was short of breath. :( It was quite sad because for 1, she sings amazingly on the albums, and for 2, that's likely the biggest show they will ever have, the DVD that could have made them 5x as famous, and her singing is the only real problem with it. That said, her singing was amazing on the Quantum Enigma album, probably the best she's ever sung. 
p1298
aVWasn't Simone pregnant when they recorded that? I think that was the main problem that caused her to underperform.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, I agree that the vocals on Retrospect were sub-par, though I don't mind them much.\u000a\u000aHer vocals are definitely much better now, not only on TQE, but live too. I went to one of their concerts last November (3rd time seeing them live), and her vocals sounded way better, compared to the previous concerts I attended. Her voice is becoming more and more powerful, and she's managing to hit those high notes really well.
p1299
aVShe only sings well when she is very fresh. Tours fatigue her very quickly. 
p1300
aVI listened to the Phantom Agony and it seems like she doesn't finish each word properly which is sad because it's one of my favorite songs by her. But I just looked up some info on that DVD...it was a 3 hour long concert? And not only that but she was a few months pregnant... I don't blame her for singing like she was out of breath!
p1301
aVYeah, I agree, and that was one of her worst performances, but not too far out of the vein of how she normally sings in live concerts. 
p1302
aVI actually thought Retrospect was one of her better performances. When I saw her prior to that, her vocals weren't that good. She said that she had extra singing lessons to prepare for Retrospect and I felt she'd improved because of that. When I saw the band at the end of last year she did a good job, though she still sings in a way that I find slightly strange. She often sounds sharp and quite a few times it was like she'd taken too long singing the lines and one would spill over into the other. (I apologise because I don't have any technical knowledge of singing and it's hard to explain what I mean!)
p1303
aVThe vocals spilling over into the next line is her idea of improvisation I think... She is a very good singer when she sings normally but I think she is trying to introduce variety into the songs by doing what you just said, and it doesn't usually work out well (think of all of the "over-sung" Christmas song covers by famous artists, that have so many added notes, ornaments, and "ooo-oooh"s that the original melody is hard to recognize). 
p1304
aVThat would make sense, actually! That probably is what she's going for.
p1305
aVI *LOVE* AFTER FOREVER.\u000a\u000aFloor is easily my favorite female symphonic metal singer - I absolutely love Decipher, and all of its strings and the oboe and aaaa. So many good songs on that album. My Pledge of Allegiance #1, Intrinsic especially, Imperfect Tenses, The Key, Forlorn Hope...\u000a\u000aI'm really excited to see Floor with Nightwish, especially after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA). I'm seeing them in May and I'm so *pumped*.\u000a\u000aSomeone a little while back posted something here about AF's history, which was pretty cool, and it really brought out the subtle differences in style when they switched songwriters or whatever.\u000a\u000aI dunno. I really love After Forever. Epica was the first SM band I'd listened to, followed by Kamelot (because of Roy Khan on Trois Vierges - seriously, I heard his voice and almost started believing in God), and then some less-symphonic stuff, like Rhapsody of Fire and Symphony X, and then came Nightwish, and after that, After Forever and Floor's other band Revamp.\u000a\u000aI just love everything, I guess.
p1306
aVI will agree with you on Floor being the best... During the videos I've watched of her live performances, she seems much more "enthusiastic" and energetic than Simone, for example, and her singing in live concerts is the best of any female SM singer that I know of. Decipher is awesome... as a composer myself, I can only say that the mixing and orchestration is some of the best I have ever heard for a SM album... even though the string section is small, it fits in wonderfully with the music. This was continued for Invisible Circles but abandoned for Reimagine... one of the reasons the last two albums aren't my favorites. 
p1307
aVAfter Forever is still one of my all time favorite bands and I've listened to their stuff repeatedly. I'd agree that their songwriting was probably their biggest downfall, but there was something about the spirit behind the music that made it special. With some songs they really hit the nail on the head, and with others they included some parts that were just boring, not needed, sounded rushed, lacking in a strong melody, went on for too long. Epica suffer from this too, but AF's albums suffered a little too much, which is unfortunate because they put out a lot of amazing stuff overall. I found that they improved a lot over time, and that their last self-titled album is their best, finding the perfect balance between strong songs and technical displays. It was very well paced and the production is extremely solid. I actually think Transitory is one of the most awesome songs they ever made, and it wasn't symphonic at all - a drastic departure in sound for them.\u000a\u000aI agree that Epica turned out to be the most successful and pure symphonic metal band. After Forever could have become that. It's sad because like I said, I think they peaked with their last album, and could have improved even more with future releases. At least they went out on top and have that to be proud of. Floor was always their strongest asset and a perfect vehicle for their music, so I really am looking forward to Endless Forms Most Beautiful. It will combine what I consider a legendary voice in metal with the songs of a legendary songwriter.
p1308
aVI think in the first 3 AF albums at least, the melodies just take longer to appreciate than with other bands. In the last album there were only a few memorable melodies, and a lot that sounded too poppy. Still, even the last album was way better in my opinion than a lot of Nightwish's recent stuff or any of Within Temptation (just my opinion WT fans... not bashing you :))... 
p1309
aVI saw them live a few times. Living in the Netherlands has its perks. They were always really good on stage, but their last few albums were too poppy for my liking so I wasn't that sad to see them disband.\u000a\u000aEdit\u000a\u000aThey played The Final Countdown once, that's in my top 5 metal moments
p1310
aVYeah, I wish they would have stayed away from the poppy sounds... some songs on the last two albums really suffered from this and it just wasn't the same as in Decipher or IC.

asVBlind Guardian - Making of the new album, episode 3
p1327
(lp1328
V&gt;After discussing it, it became obvious that, on the last album, we took a step into the right direction with songs like [*Sacred Worlds*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFZ_Uyqbr4k), [*Wheel of Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ts8cPScXM). Our kind of Blind Guardian metal blended together perfectly with a grand orchestra.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp; \u000a\u000aThose two songs are insanely good. I'm really happy the band agrees and wants to make more stuff like that. 
p1329
aVOne of the things I really love about Wheel of Time is how much the orchestra takes the lead over the guitars. The short song previews at the end of this, but especially at the end of the making of trailer episode 2 sound absolutely incredible.\u000a\u000aEdit: I just realized it's the same preview at the end of both trailers. Anyway, I can't wait to hear that whole song!
p1330
aVYeah that preview sounds really good, which is somewhat of a relief because I found the recently released single to be rather lacking in the symphonic department. \u000a\u000aAnother thing that is great about *Wheel of Time* is that the book series is every bit as good as the song is!
p1331
aV&gt; I found the recently released single to be rather lacking in the symphonic department\u000a\u000aWhich I think is to be expected with some (if not most) of the other songs on this upcoming album. Blind Guardian is a power metal band first and foremost. Yet, they are able to blend in symphonic and prog metal elements pretty flawlessly in some songs. If I recall correctly, only *Sacred Worlds* and *Wheel of Time* had heavy use of orchestration on their last album, while other songs like *Tanelorn* and *Ride into Obsession* are pretty much straight power metal.  \u000a\u000aSo basically, I really only expect *The Ninth Wave* and *The Grand Parade* to have heavy use of orchestration. However, I could be wrong as they've only been experimenting with orchestrations since the last album. Also, I think this might be the first album to use choirs so it will be an interesting album indeed. I can't wait.
p1332
aVI definitely agree. I think the single will fit in a similar spot on the album as A Voice in the Dark did: the song meant to appeal to the widest part of their fan base.

aVAs it should be.
p1343
aVIs this song about meditation? 
p1344
aVI can't remember if the band have ever given an explanation, but I think it might be - or at least, taking a moment to recover yourself when you're feeling anxious, depressed or panicked.
p1345
aVI always thought it had to do with mindfulness, but the band (or Mark) has never given an explanation of what the song really is about. 
p1346
aVI'm pretty sure that's what it's about. 'Retrieve your balance... find the silence within you' - makes sense.
p1347
aVAnd it fits with the album cover too.

VUgh... What the fuck is wrong with people?\u000a\u000aIt's already bad enough that she has to put up with assholes filming entire concerts or taking pictures constantly with their crappy phones, and having people getting overly physical when trying to get autographs and whatnot, now she's getting hate over that too? Pathetic.\u000a\u000aAnd of course, as usual, the comment section on that site is just cancerous.
p1372
aVSinger posts reasonable letter requesting respect for her personal space and respect when she is on stage. People react like she's a terrible person. \u000a\u000aIt's ridiculous.\u000a\u000a
p1373
aVWhy the hell are people attacking her over this? \u000a\u000aI wish bands started outright banning anything over a cellphone for shows. If you go to a concert just to film it you should be kicked out.
p1374
aVWell I do like having one song or two recorded on my phone, just for memories. But yeah, being behind a phone the whole time, which my dad does and I cant get him to stop, is annoying to everyone.
p1375
aVI mean, enjoy the concert, that's why you're there. A week later, watching a crappy video that you took instead of dancing... it doesn't compare. 
p1376
aVNo it doesn't compare, but you can say the same thing about pictures of anything. Looking at pictures or videos can still invoke a bit of that feeling of being there. That is what memories are.
p1377
aVYeah, but what do you remember? "I sat as still as possible so I wouldn't jostle the camera"? "I got angry when that dude shoved my arm aside because they couldn't see the stage because of my phone" ?\u000a\u000aObviously, recording a song or two or taking a couple pictures is different from recording the whole thing, but if you record the "best" couple of songs from your favourite band instead of losing yourself to the moment you do yourself a disservice, imo.
p1378
aVI remember the great time I had at the concert and the feeling I got when Floor hits that last note in Ghost Love Score. Things like that. Just seeing a bit of a video of any part of the concert makes me remember all the good times.
p1379
aVI record one song from every band I go and see live. I don't nitpick every little detail after watching it again and just let the memories return to me.\u000a\u000anot everyone focuses on the minor shit and just having that fleeting connection to a past experience is enough to bring all those emotions rushing forward again.
p1380
aVI really enjoy searching Youtube for people who have filmed concerts I have personally been too. Even the crappy quality of someones phone seems amazing when what you're seeing lines up with a performance you remember.
p1381
aVI live in the Maritimes in Canada, where the closest city with 1 million people is around a 20 hour drive or a $750 flight away, so I have next to no chance of seeing any symphonic metal band, I appreciate that there are some good quality cell phone vids on YouTube.
p1382
aVDidn't the same thing happen to Simone Simmons. Someone had a video of a bunch of people touching her hair and stuff, and then she says "don't touch me/my hair" and they went all berzerk and called her racist?\u000a\u000aBut I guess there will always be haters everywhere you go. You just have to ignore them and focus on your real fans.
p1383
aVSo that's what that video lurking at the bottom of all the YouTube suggestions is about...
p1384
aVI understand what Floor is saying, but I think the way she expressed her opinion wasn't perfect.\u000aI completely agree with the phone complaint. It's annoying going to a concert and see everyone recording and taking pictures all the freaking time. I don't think she can change the attitude of the fans, though, and it would be responsibility of the venue and the security crew to prevent that to happen, more so when everyone uses flash, which directly affects the performance.\u000a\u000aAbout the fans comment, though, I have mixed feelings. I mean, I understand her point of view and I also agree that she doesn't have to go around taking pictures with everyone (we pay to see a concert, not to meet them) and that's an extra we should appreciate, but if that involves paying, it becomes more difficult. If you've paid extra money to go to a "meet and greet" and take some pictures after/before the concert with the band, I wouldn't like it to be an "Avril Lavigne" situation where you have to stand awkwardly next to each other with half a meter of separation. If you don't like being hugged (which I totally respect) or that people touch your shoulder while taking a picture, then don't do these kind of things in certain countries. \u000aShe goes to many different countries with completely different cultures, and in some of them the human interaction is closer and more "intimate". Saying something like: "please, don't touch me" when someone touches your arm before taking a picture, even if it's the politest way possible, it's considered a total disrespect to the other person.\u000aI get that some people are psychos, assholes and very disrespectful human beings who just try to take advantage when she's near, but others aren't, and they feel bad when they get rejected while trying to get a picture of their idol.\u000aI think that she should reconsider how she approaches the fans in certain countries, and I hope this doesn't affect her when she tours with Nightwish.
p1385
aVI think it's more people going for full-on hugs, grabbing her and trying to touch her hair and so on. Certainly when I met her at a Nightwish meet and greet I asked for a photo and she just smiled, said yes and put her arm around me automatically. I don't think she has any objection to that.
p1386
aVI'm glad to hear that! From her post I thought she didn't want anyone to touch her at all, which is what surprised me.
p1387
aVwas going to come here to say something similar, when i saw them in atlanta, we stepped out for a cig break after their show, saw them by the fence so we put out our cigs and walked up said good show, i shook the guitarist's hand. These nightmare stories always seem to come from south america. I wonder if there is a connection.
p1388
aVIf you look at FB/Instagram/whatever posts, the comments are always filled with things like "MY QUEEN YOU ARE MY GODDESS! come play &lt;location&gt;" ...and it's almost always somewhere in latin america (or occasionally eastern europe).\u000a\u000aI've always hoped someone would come along and explain if there was some sort of cultural thing I didn't know about that causes that.

asVEpica - Unchain Utopia (4:45) [2nd single from The Quantum Enigma]
p1393
(lp1394
VI'm really loving the prominence of the choir vocals in these new songs.
p1395
aVFrom hearing this and The Essence of Silence, I'm really loving the sound of Simone's voice. She sounds really good. 
p1396
aVIt sounds like she's using her lower falsetto range quite a bit - somewhere between her "normal" range and the operatic ranges. It's great to see her experimenting with different styles of the same "instrument". 
p1397
aVShe's bringing her head voice down into her lower notes, and using less chest voice overall. 
p1398
aVEpica never ceases to amaze me. I can't believe how incredible this band is.
p1399
aVSeriously. In my opinion, they haven't had a bad album yet. I keep thinking that they are bound to make a bad album at some point (as every band has at least one album that is bad compared to the rest). But with Epica, each new album is getting better.
p1400
aVI think the closest they have come to a bad album was Requiem for the Indifferent, and that album was still pretty good. I had a number of problems with RFTI: the guitars had a strange and sometimes jarring tone (ex: guitar solo on Monopoly on Truth), too many songs were forgettable (mainly from the last half of the album), and it didn't have as large of a sound as their previous albums (it sounded more stripped down and minimalistic).\u000a\u000aI was getting worried that Epica was starting to head down hill, so I am ecstatic that the first singles from the Quantum Enigma are so promising. The sound is more massive and multi-layered than ever, the guitars are brutal but blended well, orchestral elements are more prominent, and the larger choir sounds amazing. If the rest of the songs from TQE are consistently this good, then this will be a strong contender for Epica's best album. 
p1401
aVI actually grew to like RFTI. Agreed, that a lot of it was forgettable though. Their best ballad came from it though. I absolutely cherish Delirium.
p1402
aVAbsolutely! I've been into Epica since The Divine Conspiracy came out. And each album, I fall in love with them all over again!

aVThis album is shaping up to be extremely solid. I can't wait until May!

aVOh cool, I didn't know Nuclear Blast did downloads. Cheers!

sVEasiest Epica songs to play on 7-string guitar?
p1428
(lp1429
VWhat would you say your guitar playing ability is at? I bought my seven string solely for playing epica related songs also :P
p1430
aVGuitar-wise I'm a relative beginner... however, I have been playing keyboard and composing for 6-7 years, so I don't have any problems reading sheet music/tabs or understanding chords. I got stuck at the fast part in "Consign to Oblivion" because my fingers just aren't fast enough on guitar to do that. So I don't think I could tackle songs like "Monopoly on Truth," "Deter the Tyrant" etc. that have a lot of fast left-hand work. I am able to alternate-pick though so the fast parts as in "Dance of Fate" where the picking is the only fast thing are not too bad. 
p1431
aVYeah with a lot of epica songs you'll find the right hand strumming is trickier than the left so it's good if you can strum fast. Try songs (keeping to the fast strumming theme) like menace of vanity, last crusade, quietus, death of a dream (tricky but fun), never enough, cry for the moon, seif Al din (another trickier one), burnt to a cinder. Hope you manage to work those out. Those are the ones I consider the most fun that aren't too technically difficult. Good luck! Tell me how they go :)
p1432
aVThanks... I hadn't thought about burn to a cinder and haven't even listened to menace of vanity for a long time and did not think of quietus either. I actually learned most of Never Enough yesterday and the day before... Not my favorite Epica song but still good and probably the easiest one I could think of. Death of a Dream is one of my favorites so if it's not too hard I might like playing that... same with Last Crusade... probably the two most choir-centric Epica songs. Thanks for the tips! \u000a\u000aActually looking through the Jellynote.com website (which has free Epica sheet music and tabs) I just found that Martyr of the Free Word is really fast but does not seem to have too many hard left-hand parts (if I exclude the solo that is). 
p1433
aVHey, actually Martyr was way too hard to play full speed. I pretty much can play Never Enough and Cry for the Moon... just need a little more work on the fast picking in the latter to keep up with the song. 
p1434
aVHi! Sorry for such a late reply. Yeah Martyr is hard, especially the solo. I've been learning Kingdom of heaven pt 1 which is probably on the same difficulty as Marty's in areas, but it's really fun. I'd give that a go. The lead is quite hard, but the rhythm guitar which is what Mark is playing should be managable. Beyond belief is another one that's not too hard (excluding the solo)
p1435
aVWow... KOH... that would be a fun one to play - but probably beyond my level right now. I think I've realized about Epica's music that the guitar parts were easier before Issac joined them... The first album especially seems to not have many super-difficult parts. I finally played the fast part of Cry for the Moon at full tempo and now am working on Sensorium. Not much hard left-hand work there but some fast picking. I would agree that Mark's parts are generally a lot easier than Issac's. I notice him making some mistakes at the live concerts I watch on YouTube... probably having to growl and guitar at the same time is hard for him... I think he's a better composer than performer, but his growls are beast on the albums.

(lp1448
VKamelot - Epica/The Black Halo.  These are two of the albums that got me into symphonic metal, with The Black Halo still being one of my favourites in the genre.  They are based on Goethe's Faust, which is quite an ambitious concept for a rock/metal album.  The music is awesome, with the song "Memento Mori" being particularly memorable.
p1449
aVOh yeah, I forgot about that one. And I agree, it's a great album and Memento Mori is pretty amazing.
p1450
aVAfter Forever's *Invisible Circles* gets a lot of hate, but it's among my favourites too. Only their final album is better.\u000a\u000aWith Tristania I could never choose between *World of Glass* and *Widow's Weeds*. \u000a\u000aTo add albums that haven't been mentioned in this thread but absolutely deserve to be (in no particular order):\u000a\u000a* Therion - *Secret of the Runes* is a brilliant work of art. It deals extensively with Nordic mythology, in particular its various worlds. Look up the live version of *Schwarzalbenheim*.\u000a\u000a* Leaves' Eyes - *Symphonies of the Night* is my favourite album by them. Each track tells the story of a heroine from history, legend or literature. The titular song is one of my all time favourite symphonic metal songs! \u000a\u000a* Delain - *The Human Contradiction* is inspired by a science fiction series and has a noticeable theme, but I'm not sure if it should be called a concept album. Still, it's their best work imo. \u000a\u000a* Blind Guardian - *At the Edge of Time* has most tracks based on fantasy/sci-fi series. *Sacred Worlds* and *Wheel of Time* are unbelievably good songs.\u000a\u000aI could go on but the albums I mentioned already are so ridiculously good, if any of them are unfamiliar you should fix that asap!
p1451
aV1. [Avantasia - The Metal Opera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHjYmyJlSSI): Can't believe this came out thirteen years ago now, time flies. It's symphonic metal with strong power metal influences and lots of synths. What sets this album apart is the all-star cast: Tobias Sammet (Edguy), Sharon Den Adel (Within Temptation), Michael Kiske &amp; Kai Hansen (Helloween), Oliver Hartmann (At Vance), Timo Tolkki (Stratovarius), Andre Matos (Angra), and others. Not only they're great singers, I love how they're attributed characters and how songs are constructed as dialogs between them.  \u000aThe lyrics are also pretty cool, they're a fantasy story based off gnosis and Christian imagery. It reminds me of Diablo and Soul Reaver a bit =)\u000a\u000a2. [Haggard - Awaking the Century](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZT99lqg5L8): This is symphonic metal with a chamber orchestra and harsh vocals. The music is very baroque, sometimes medieval and it would be fair to draw comparisons to folk metal. This album is a perfect example of the "Beauty and the Beast" trope but with more diversity than the genres usually offers - thanks to the huge ensemble of musicians and inspired songwriting. Songs do not follow usual templates the album is flowing freely - it's hard to guess when the metal parts are coming but they always fit perfectly.  \u000aI've never paid attention to the story very much but I recall it's about [Nostradamus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostradamus).\u000a\u000a3. [Rhapsody - Legendary Tales/Symphony of Enchanted Land/Dawn of Victory/Rain of a Thousand Flames/Power of the Dragonflame](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtAjGVhQNJk): I'm a bit biased here because Rhapsody is the band that got me into symphonic metal in the first place. Nonetheless, releasing a complete (cheesy) fantasy saga across five albums is still an incredible feat! The music is a blend of power metal with lots of synths and clear baroque inspirations, topped by male vocals and neoclassical guitar solos.\u000a\u000a4. [Therion - Secret of the Runes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3p6jtN3EpU): Incredible album from start to finish. Like most Therion releases, it's hard to pick "hit" or favorite tracks. It's very well crafted music that paints its own world without trying to hook the listener in so it takes a bit of effort to get into. The choir and numerous vocalists give a very operatic tone to the album (not to mention the Nordic theme which resonates with Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen). If you've never listened to Therion before, I wouldn't recommend this album first.

aVDefinitely a huge fan of The Unforgiving, but I have to disagree on Invisible Circles. The music is great, but the god awful, cringeworthy voice acting almost ruined the album for me.\u000a\u000aIt hasn't been released yet, but I'm really excited for Dark Sarah's first album. Almost like a concept band. Also, not really a concept album per se, but I love the theme of powerful/important women, whether in fiction or history, running through Leaves' Eyes' Symphonies of the Night.
p1454
aVOh yeah, still need to check Leaves' Eyes latest stuff. I never followed them much since I'm not a fan of Liv Kristine's voice, but some of the tracks I heard seemed pretty good.
p1455
aVI wasn't a fan until SotN, and that's still the only album I really enjoy.
p1456
aVThe Embrace that Smothers. It's a series of songs by After Forever and Epica covering the problems of organised religion, something I identify with. Album wise I think The Divine Conspiracy handled it the best and it's enjoyable musically. Shout out to Mea Culpa, in my opinion the best intro track to an album ever.

aVCarach Angren - Where the Corpses Sink Forever\u000a\u000aWhere the Corpses Sink Forever is a symphonic black metal concept album about the atrocities of war that beautifully blends brutality of the metal side with the flow and melody of the symphonic side. \u000a\u000aI had heard a little bit of symphonic metal before that and was never really too keen on it, but Where the Corpses Sink Forever was the first symphonic metal that really caught my attention and led me to delve deeper into other symphonic metal and really give it a chance; and I'm very glad that it did.\u000a
p1460
aVI've heard some Carach Angren stuff before and I liked it. I should look into that album.
p1461
aVI definitely liked it more than their previous albums. It just seems like it struck an ideal balance between beauty and brutality, to me. In addition, it sounds like the production value is much higher and is overall more refined than their earlier albums.\u000a\u000aI've heard it described as their previous recordings utilizing symphonic elements as a more traditional metal role while Where the Corpses Sink Forever lets the symphonic elements stay a bit more symphonic and stand somewhat on their own while more of working alongside and intertwining with the metal rather than being just "metal parts played on symphonic type instruments." \u000a\u000aThat may not make much sense until you've listened to the album, but I think it is about as accurate of a description as can be made by someone not particularly well educated on nuances, technicalities, and proper terminology; ie, me.
p1462
aVFor full on albums, I find bands tend to lose focus by the end of the album for the most part (Imaginaerum comes to mind) with few bands keeping it together throughout (Kamelot's Epica/Black Halo)\u000a\u000aWith that, I prefer pieces put together, much like the Elizabeth trilogy on Karma (Kamelot) or The Embrace That Smothers (After Forever/Epica).
p1463
aVMy favourites:\u000a\u000a1. Imaginaerum by Nightwish \u000a2. The Unforgiving by WT\u000a3. The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck by Tuomas Holopainen \u000a4. Njord by Leaves' Eyes (for the Viking/Norse theme)\u000a\u000aI would probably include pretty much every Epica album, since they seem to always have a particular theme.
p1464
aVLife and Times is fantastic, but I didn't think it really fell under metal.  I love it when the horns kick in on 'Into the West'.
p1465
aVOh true, it's definitely not metal! I heard it wasn't even going to have any guitars or drums until he begrudgingly added some to the single. I guess I just think of it within the genre since it's Tuomas and the compositions are so Nightwishy.

aVEvanescence did this with all the members of the original band except for the singer, getting a singer that sounds really similar and calling themselves "we are the fallen". \u000a\u000aEvanescence's first album was named Fallen.

aVWe Are The Fallen's singer sounds like a cross between Amy Lee and Cristina Scabbia.  I was unaware of that backstory of the band members though.

p1492
aVIt makes sense. Both of these women have no reason to have any ill will towards each other. Hell even some of the lyrics of tarja's solo stuff leads me to believe she is still affected by the circumstances that lead to her dismissal. \u000a\u000aThough I think Anettes main issue was her body at (41) couldn't handle the stress of having a child and touring a schedule like nightwish kept. Even floor had a mental break after the schedule kept by after forever. Its what revamps wild card album is about.\u000a\u000aNightwish often takes a good year or so off after tours to stop that from happening, it just so happened annette had a kid during this time.\u000a\u000aShe was a good vocalist for what toumas wanted which is why he picked her. He wanted to make more film score music. DPP was a therapy album, Imaginarium was what he hired Anette for and she killed it on that album. Anette always had issues with pitch live however something Tarja never did. I can understand why they decided to make a change. Unlike the situation with tarja (where they made it abundantly clear her firing had less to do with her and more to do with her husband) anettes was left at a "we have decided to part ways we wish her the best of luck". Most bands don't last 5 years, Anette was with nightwish for almost as long as tarja. (1999-2005 and 2007-2012)
p1493
aVI know this is an old comment, but Tarja has been in NW from 1996 not 1999
p1494
aVThey didn't release AFF till end of 98.
p1495
aVYes but until 1998 they worked on AFF. \u000a\u000aThe band was formed in 1996 by Tuomas, Tarja ans Emppu(Jukka aswell i think but i'm not sure). So I guess you can add the time they spent on making that album. I don't want to be 'that guy', but it's just my opinion
p1496
aVI guess thats true but i guess i was more viewing touring life span. They didn't really play shows until after AFF was written.\u000a\u000aThe thing is now that they have Floor most of the performance problems go away from annette and i can say she is personally more fun to watch than tarja who took a more diva (as in opera diva lots of costume changes etc) to performing. Floor just gets up head bangs has fun and sings on pitch and awesome.\u000a\u000aPlus she gives toumas so many more tools. The things she does in revamp is awesome.\u000a
p1497
aVYou are right, Floor really is great live. Her voice is wonderful, and I personally cant say I want Tarja back in NW. I like Tarja's solo work aswell. \u000a\u000aAlso, about the diva thing, you are so right. I went on her concert in Vienna on Sunday, and she changed her outfit 2 times. \u000aI really think Floor is great and I'm looking forward to their new album, but I could never like Nightwish like I used to... For me Tuomas makes me not like the band so much:/\u000a\u000aAnyway, I understand what you are saying and I agree with you, but I still like Tarja more than Nightwish(mostly because of Tuomas).
p1498
aVToumas writes all of the music save a few tracks marco writes. Tarja writes next to none of her music save the lyrics and oasis. \u000a\u000aIF you like nightwish it is solely because of toumas.
p1499
aVYou are right, Tuomas did write about 90% of the songs, but what I dont like about him is how he kicked Tarja out of NW. I personally think it was jealousy towards Tarja's husband. I do belive Tuomas is a great writer, but he was an asshole when he did that. 
p1500
aVYou do realise that the reason they kicked tarja was because her husband started making unrealistic demands as her manager such as no shows &lt;3000 people, she had to fly on a separate plane with him etc. They didn't want to get rid of Tarja, but from a business standpoint nightwish isn't metallica they aren't selling out arena's in the US and they aren't going to make enough to book tarja a private jet to fly around in on tour.\u000a\u000a

VA lot of people don't like the Unia/DoG-era stuff, but I really like their more dramatic songs from the era. The less-heavy stuff is pretty bad though.\u000a\u000aThankfully, this song falls into the first category. Not my favorite(that goes to Deathaura), but one of the songs that sold me on post-Reckoning Night Sonata Arctica.
p1517
aVI was kinda iffy on this song UNTIL I saw them perform live. Tony pours so much more into the performance up on stage. Great song. 
p1518
aVI love this song, as I love this album. Reckoning Night reigns as my favorite album, but there is just something amazing about this one. Every song as that deep, meaningful, and catchy-in-a-good-way feel. \u000a\u000aThis is, however, the beginning, along with Unia, of the slippery slope they have slid so far down. Needless to say, they took this less heavy, more full of drama and passion view too far and the result is the most recent 2 albums. \u000a\u000aWhen I heard "The Wolves Die Young" I had such high hopes for this album. The first time listening to it, however, I couldn't even finish. Each songs seems to depart further and further from the Sonata Arctica of old. \u000a\u000aI do nonetheleas have some hope for the future. Seeing them live this most recent NA tour, made me realize they are still a great band. I even enjoyed the songs from Pariah's Child live, despite themselves.\u000a\u000aSonata Arctica will always been one of my favorites, and I hope they will return soon to their former glory. 
p1519
aVI thought *Pariah's Child* was a pretty awesome album, and I refuse to acknowledge that an album exists between it and TDOG. Stuff like "Blood" and "What Did You Do in the War, Dad?" sound just like *Winterheart's Guild* and *Unia* fused together, and then you've got normal speedy stuff like "X Marks the Spot" and "Running Lights". It's definitely a very zany album at times, but it was one of my favorites last year after I almost wrote the band off when they released that abomination in 2012.

(lp1536
VMid-twenties Asian-Canadian male. I get more confused looks than scoffs whenever I mention my odd musical preference. Most of my friends who are into hard rock and metal are always happy to go with me to concerts headlining female-fronted bands like Epica, though it's always a bonus if a band like Alestorm or Sabaton are supporting as well. If any one criticizes you for listening to "girly" metal, just shrug and tell them that you can't help it if you rather have a woman sing to you than some dude with ratty hair ;)
p1537
aVMid-twenties American male. I hadn't even heard about the negative stereotypes associated with the genre until very recently, and I've been listening to Nightwish for years.  Mostly, I've just received weird looks when I say "symphonic metal".\u000a\u000aI've never had anyone give me crap, but I have had people tell me that some people *would* give me crap. The thing is, I don't care. I love this music, even if it causes some raised eyebrows.  You know what? I think I like it more *because* of the raised eyebrows.

p1542
aVMidtwenties east/central European male here... I don't have the time anymore, but in my highschool/college days I spent a lot of time in one of the Metal-ish bars in my town. Nightwish, Epica, WT were a large part of the playlists, though it played anything from Hard Rock to Death metal. The people were a mostly even mix of male and female, and everyone knew the big names of Symphonic - Nightwish and WT, that is. Epica was sadly, less represented at the time, although that's not surprising since they didn't really exist for most of those years :) \u000a\u000aEdit: Also, this is the first time I hear of any stereotype associated with Symphonic in general. Never heard of anyone saying anything against this genre specifically, just your basic "You have long hair -&gt; you're a rocker -&gt; satanist!!" crap. 
p1543
aVNever met another person with a similar taste in music than me, I'm 20 and English. I've tried to find folks who like similar stuff, but the closest I get is people who like basic metal.\u000a\u000aI've never considered it, nor heard it be called, 'girly' metal. I can maybe see why someone would say so, but I can't see why they could *justly* say so. People like different things, and everyone is allowed their own likes and dislikes. 
p1544
aVNo one has actually called it girly, but in my mind I think people judge it as being not a real metal genre since it has operatic/melodic female vocals. 
p1545
aVwell then I'm gonna need a strict definiton of 'real metal'. Symphonic Metal is vast, just like basic metal. Something like Symphony X is nothing like Nightwish, despite a few common themes. \u000a\u000aLet people think whatever they want, just enjoy what you enjoy.

aVWent to a concert in Austin featuring Nightwish and Kamelot. 90% "big" males, a few with their girlfriends. In America, it's mostly liked by males. In Europe, it's a little different, but still more male-oriented from what I've seen.
p1548
aV21 year old American male here. I've only come across one person who knew Nightwish existed. However, when I went to see Nightwish live, I met a lot of people (guys and girls) who knew a lot about Symphonic Metal. I've personally never heard anyone refer to it as "girly", but I can see why some people would call it that. You're always going to come across someone who is an elitist that only listens to extreme metal and dismisses everything else as not "Trve" Metal. 
p1549
aVAmerican 23 year old guy here. Just saw my favorite band, Within Temptation, in Los Angeles and even got to participate in a meet and greet with about a hundred people. Needless to say, I nearly flipped my shit because I've never even seen them in concert before, and I got to talk with, pose with, and even listen to Sharon, Robert, and Ruud play a few songs for us for FREE!!! This is cause Within Temptation sadly never plays any shows in the USA with a small following here, and as such, very few of my friends ever heard of the band (I had actually introduced it to my boyfriend). Those who did know were also mostly men, but I don't believe that their genre of symphonic metal should be considered gender-specific, we can all acknowledge that it is beautiful music, and it's fit for anyone to listen to. (Also, never heard anyone tell me it sounded "girly" to them, and I'd grill them on why that's not a bad thing.)
p1550
aV18yo male Western European here.\u000aI spend a lot of time playing online games, and I actually got introduced to Nightwish by a fellow WoW guildmate. Another one of these guildmates is actually a female singer for a little symphonic metal band, some other mates were metalheads.\u000a\u000aA part from people I met online though, I had to introduce all my friends to this (even though they mostly listen to rap, or bands like SoAD/Metallica, they have a really hard time with english so I guess its harder for them to feel the poetry in it), except one who knew Sonata Arctica for Letter to Dana/Shy.\u000a\u000aHave to admit I got a lot of weird reactions and stereotypes about that,  I once went to high school with a NW shirt and I got at least 2 people telling me that its totally metal for girls, and I shouldn't be listening to it. Plus the classic "omg do you believe in Satan ?" "why don't you have long hair and wear non-black things ?" "can you headbang in front of me please, i never seen it before [has a Nirvana T-Shirt] ?"
p1551
aVI'm a 24-year-old female from the UK. Although I had briefly heard of Nightwish when I was about 14, it wasn't until I was 17 and met some new people who introduced me to Within Temptation that I really learnt what symphonic metal was. They were playing a rare concert nearby, so I went along and got hooked.\u000a\u000aIn general, most people round here wouldn't know what symphonic metal was. I've found amongst metalheads that it is more well known, but there is largely quite a stigma attached to it. I once had a guy at a metal night literally turn around and start ignoring me because I said my favourite band was Nightwish. It seems like it's often a bit of a prejudice based on people not liking clean/operatic singing (I've not encountered anyone who has a problem with Arch Enemy). A super elitist guy I knew that only liked black and death metal was actually quite happy to listen to Epica once I'd introduced him to them and explained what people like about the genre. It's a different story if you go to a symphonic metal concert though, of course - everyone's a fan there!\u000a\u000aAs for the gender thing, I have actually heard people saying that symphonic metal is for girls, so you aren't imagining it! It's mostly the kind of thing said in awful YouTube comments and such. However, at every concert I've been to it has been at least 50% male if not more. I'm an admin on the Muses of Metal facebook page (a fanzine for female-fronted bands but largely covering symphonic metal) and according to the stats, the page likes are from 66% males and 34% females. So you are not alone...
p1552
aVI have been to see Nightwish live twice. Believe me when I say the Symphonic metal fanbase is extremely diverse. Old men with fully gray beards were there.\u000a\u000aBTW I am 39, male, American, and went to those concerts with my 63 year old dad. And e were front row both head banging and rocking out.
p1553
aV18 year old Turkish guy here. I have a few friends from the school that are symphonic metal fans like me. When I say I listen to symphonic metal, people tend to either act curious cause they've never heard of it, or say that they're not a fan of it if they've heard it before. I've never heard anyone say something bad about it like girly or such. I've actually encountered quite a few people that don't usually listen to metal but know of a popular band. (Nightwish, Haggard or Epica) 
p1554
aVYou must know of Almora, then? I first encountered them while doing research prior to my four-month trip to Istanbul, and was extremely impressed with how elegant Turkish sounded in their songs - very flowing, almost like what I imagine Elvish to be. A shame the band's no longer around, even if the leader continues to do his own non-metal pieces.
p1555
aVSurely. [Catafalque](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1y38Vro300) is another former symphonic/gothic metal band, though they don't have any songs in Turkish afaik. Then there is Pentagram[[1]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgGClkwAQiY)[[2]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjI2L-8k_HE) which is mostly power/thrash metal but they're rather popular and still going strong after 25 years.
p1556
aVI'm a 24y/o American male surfer. I was just in Sweden, and Nightwish played over the radio in a busy city sportsbar full of rowdy hockey fans, and no one even thought twice. The American scene tends to just be less accepting of diversity in the people who are into metal for the image/lifestyle-appearance. Anyone who actually likes any metal-derived music, even if they only like grindcore or whatever, will still acknowledge the musical contribution that genre-bending, or genre-redefining bands have had in furthering the metal movement.

aVMid-twenties Central European guy. Listened to symphonic metal for the first time ten years ago, never looked back. No one should be ashamed for what they like listening to, and nothing besides Hanna Montana should be considered "girly" music.\u000a\u000aI know two other people who like the same music I do, another guy and a girl. So there's more of us.
p1560
aV19 year old central european male here. While most of my peers have never heard of any Symphonic Metal band I have also never encountered anyone looking down on this subgenere on the basis of the reason you mentioned. My impression of the concerts I attended was that the majority of attendants is male - but that is nothing special, as metal in general seems to have more male than female fans. The only special aspect of Symphonic Metal compared to other Metal subgeneres I can think of is that I found it to be more accessible to people who are not really into metal otherwise, especially if they like classical music.
p1561
aV20-something, American male.\u000a\u000aSymphonic metal is as "girly" as you want to make it seem. But for bands such as Wintersun, Dimmu Borgir, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Cradle of Filth, and Carach Angren, I can assure you that there is "Manly man" symphonic metal that gains you the appreciation of traditional "heavy metal" listeners.\u000a\u000aAnd then you have the "punky teenager" bands like Motionless in White, Wolf Hollow, Make Them Suffer, Betraying the Martyrs, and Winds of Plague if you ever decide you want to make friends quickly with some "rebellious" children in their late teens. Look 'em up if you want to see what I mean.\u000a\u000aGood on ya for realizing there's nothing to be ashamed of.
p1562
aVI'm a mid-twenties male. I'm employed full-time as a software engineer, and I currently live just outside Philadelphia. Have only ever met a few people in my life that have heard of some of the symphonic metal bands, and none that are as big of a fan as I am, sadly.

aVIndeed. Also the [website](http://epica.nl/news/2014-05-22-unchain-utopia-lyrics-video-launched) says it was meant to be a normal video originally - I had my hopes up for that, I'm getting really sick of lyric videos. But as lyric videos go, this is a good one.

aVI can understand what lyric videos bring to the emphasis of song meanings, but I was disappointed when I saw that the music video I was promised was actually a lyric video.

aVAnette does not have the voice for this song.  She cracks and is uneven is many parts of this song.   Tarja would have nailed it though.  
p1596
aVTheir magnum opus.
p1597
aVI'm going to go against the grain here: I don't find this song that appealing. Yes, it's grand and has many of the interesting elements that make us love Tuomas' works, but it lacks a melodic glue or theme that ties it all together. There isn't an enduring melody that clearly defines this song, unlike what you would find in, to use examples from different ends of the band's career, the Oceanborn and Imaginaerum tracks. 
p1598
aVI know what you mean about the melody thing. I guess it doesn't bother me so much since the song is in 4 distinct named parts, so it's almost like 4 different songs being put together to tell one story - but I prefer it when there's more of a continuous theme, like in GLS. \u000a\u000aSong of Myself has the same thing of being split but the first 3 parts are more linked together, with the last (the poem) being very different. And The Greatest Show on Earth is in 5 parts, so I'm wondering if it will be another like TPATP in style.

p1603
aVDid you try Neverworld's End from Xandria? I would say that has the most Tarja-like vocals. Also perhaps Amberian Dawn would be worth a try - End of Eden is probably a good one to start with. \u000a\u000aThere was a similar thread to this before and I was saying that really, I don't think there are any bands that truly sound like Nightwish. But when I first got into the genre I basically only listened to Within Temptation and Dark Passion Play/Once - everything else sounded strange to me. I didn't get Epica at all. It took quite a while and a lot of forcing myself to listen widely to make myself love the whole genre. I wouldn't worry - even if you only ever like those two albums, you can still call yourself a fan.
p1604
aVCould try Leaves' Eyes.  I really like Tarja-era Nightwish (was my first exposure to symphonic metal), and Leaves' Eyes is one of my favorite bands.
p1605
aVHey thanks! I looked them up. They're a nice find! 
p1606
aVTry [Pythia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ6e1ibOd40), best Nightwish clone I've heard. It's actually power metal and not symphonic, but no need to restrict yourself to one genre ;)\u000a\u000aNote: I only know this one song from this band, no clue if their other stuff is good. 
p1607
aVDon't worry, I was in a similar position to you when I started. At first I liked only Oceanborn and a couple of songs from other early Nightwish albums, then boom, other bands suddenly started to appeal to me in great numbers. It may take some time and patience, but I believe that, sooner or later, the branching out will happen to you naturally. Just allow yourself to experiment a bit from time to time, and don't be too quick to discard things you don't enjoy right now - instead shelve them for few months and see if your opinion of them will change. In my case it took over a year to finally get into Epica, but it was worth it. \u000a\u000aSorry that I'm not offering you any specific recommendations, it's been a while since I was really following the female-fronted stuff and other people here have already mentioned some good ideas. The most typically symphonic power metal bands are in my opinion Rhapsody of Fire and Blind Guardian, but their style is rather different from Nightwish. Perhaps you could try early Within Temptation though.
p1608
aVFleshgod Apocalypse.
p1609
aVJust to add to what everyone else has suggested, have you checked out Tristania? I think Leaves Eyes is definitely more Nightwish-y, but if you dig that classical opera-like voice Vibeke Stene's is pretty killer. The one song that's coming to mind is Deadlands (which I'd link to but I'm on mobile) .

VI'm guessing this is her: http://www.kristinevegard.se/ \u000a\u000aHer Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUL1K7BTc5zXjRUR1D2wIpTA\u000a\u000aNothing obvious that screams DSO in there, but I think I can see how they could fit. 
p1681
aVYeah I'm not finding it obvious either, but I can't wait to see how they sound with her!
p1682
aVTo me Annlouice's vocals were the main attraction of Diablo Swing Orchestra. From what I've been able to find of her replacement they're not going with a similar operatic style.
p1683
aVWell at least this one's attractive

p1685
(lp1686
VJust out of curiosity, are there any Epica fans here that are catholic? If so, how do feel about this song and their other songs that deal with religion? 
p1687
aVI grew up Catholic. I think the music is beautiful, obviously. As far as lyrical content, I don't really "handle" it differently than I do any other song. It's an expression of the writer's thoughts and feelings. And you know what, the Church has historically really fumbled on handling the pedophilia situation, and I know it has really hurt a lot of people. They have every right to express their opinions on the matter. I actually have grown to really like the "spiritual" messages of their songs, the scientific aspects of "we are all connected". So basically, it does not turn me off to their music. I don't really listen to the music for the lyrics anyway, music always comes first for me.
p1688
aVI am way late to this conversation but I think what you wrote was really well said\u000a
p1689
aVI'm a Catholic Epica fan.  I think that some of the criticisms in their lyrics are valid.  Ultimately, they're entitled to hold their views and to put them forwards, even though I don't like the assumption that seems to be a few of their songs that religious people are just gullible idiots.  Anyway, whether or not I am comfortable with the lyrics of any given song, I enjoy the music.
p1690
aV[Context](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vatican-paedophilia-scandal-archbishop-jozef-wesolowski-stored-over-100000-child-porn-videos-1467410).  For those of you who don't know the song's lyrics, they're a condemnation of the Catholic Church for enabling pedophiles. \u000a\u000aAlso, Simone Simons was 18 when this song was released.  There's something very appealing about an 18 year old calling the entire Catholic Church out on its bullshit.
p1691
aVI fucking hate this song, and I think it's popularity is a mark against the fan bases of both Epica and symphonic metal in general. It's so stupid, obvious, preachy, self-righteous, melodramatic, and of course the growls are indisputably awful. Not to mention the fact that it comes across as a shallow imitation of previous After Forever work (and other gothic bands like Tristania.) Epica have improved *tremendously* since their debut.\u000a\u000aI can't even listen to this song on speakers; it's too embarrassing. 
p1692
aV&gt; stupid\u000a\u000aIt's hard to address this, since I'm not sure what you're referring to.\u000a\u000a&gt; obvious\u000a\u000aDamn. Well, I will admit that I certainly had no clue what the song was about until I looked it up.\u000a\u000a&gt; preachy, self-righteous\u000a\u000aFirst of all, they're talking about the Catholic Church, which is arguably the most preachy and self-righteous organization in history. Second of all, they're decrying abuse of children at the hands of people who are supposed to protect them. If that's preachy and self-righteous, then we need more of that kind of preachiness and self-righteousness in the world.\u000a\u000a&gt; melodramatic\u000a\u000aThis genre is always dramatic, and this particular song isn't exactly making a mountain out of a molehill.  The problem is undoubtedly a big one, and it needs to be addressed.\u000a\u000a&gt; and of course the growls are indisputably awful.\u000a\u000aI actually agree with you on this, but I dislike growls in general.\u000a\u000a&gt; Not to mention the fact that it comes across as a shallow imitation of previous After Forever work (and other gothic bands like Tristania.)\u000a\u000aNo comment. I've listened to very little After Forever, and even less Tristania, though I'm currently trying to fix both of those problems.\u000a
p1693
aVAm I the only one around here who actually loves the growls on this song? The first time I listened to this, I didn't like growl vocals in general yet I loved them in this song.
p1694
aVYeah I actually really like the growls in this song, I always look forward to them when I listen to it.
p1695
aVYes! I didnt like growling vocals much when I started listening to Epica, but loved them for some reason on this track.
p1696
aVThe first two albums by After Forever were largely written by Mark Jansen. It's no surprise early After Forever and early Epica sound very similar.
p1697
aVYou definitely need to listen to early After Forever, especially the album *Decipher*. IMO it's one of the greatest albums in the symphonic gothic genre, and definitely a humongous influence on the first Epica album. The founder of Epica was a guitarist on that album, and he actually founded Epica after he was kicked out of the band. Sort of a Metallica-Megadeth type of story, except I somehow doubt Jansen was as much of an asshole as Mustaine :)
p1698
aVSorry you feel that way, but just be aware that hundreds of thousands of Epica fans disagree with you. This is one of their most played songs on tours (I think even #1 most played, with Consign to Oblivion being the only possible rival I can think of), because so many people love it. I personally didn't like the growling in Epica music at all when I first heard Epica on my Nightwish Pandora station, but Cry for the Moon was the song that finally won me over. And here I am today, considering Epica to be my favorite band.
p1699
aVMan, don't I know it. The popularity of this song is like rubbing salt in my wound! That's why I hate it instead of being merely indifferent. There are plenty of weaker Epica tracks out there, but this is the only one that gets under my skin.\u000a\u000a

No matter if you like, dislike or feel nothing about this clip, please do me a favour and share the clip all of you. You sharing it will be the final act of the Art Project.\u000a\u000aThe Art Project is hereby ended. I have explained some small things about it in the Secrets Revealed on the latest DVD and in interviews. I have started to write a short book about the rest of it for those who are interested. It has been an interesting experience. Maybe I do something similar for the 50 year anniversary.\u000aNow I just look forward to work hard on finishing the Rock Opera this year. (via https://www.facebook.com/chris.vontherion?fref=ts )\u000a\u000a\u000aPersonal EDIT: It's fuckin weird.
p1703
aVI guess I'm in the 90%, then. Hopefully they're return to being more normal because I'm not really a fan of Therion's more recent material and this art project has just been... weird.
p1704
aVWith a Rock Opera on the way I'm guessing we can expect more of the "out there" Therion
p1705
aVI'd love if they made something musically "out there" for their next album as that's where Therion has always excelled, but Les Fleurs Du Mal never caught my interest like their previous works did and didn't even sound very Therion. The art project to me has seemed to be a lot of time and money spent on making videos that are weird for the sake of weird that could've better gone towards their music, but they can do what they want, it's just a shame that their last really good album was released over 10 years ago.
p1706
aV&gt; Personal EDIT: It's fuckin weird.\u000a\u000aYes, yes it is. Gonna have to watch again when I'm not falling asleep.
p1707
aVWhat was this? I don't speak French and so all I see are the actors.
p1708
aVAll I can say for sure is Therion's most recent full length album is all covers of old-ish French pop songs, from what I've heard funded entirely out of pocket by Christofer for the sake of pursuing an extended art project. I have no idea what any of the lyrics are either but the album itself is quite good. This video is the culmination of that project.
p1709
aVLike the other songs on the Flowers of Evil album, Initials BB was also a 60s pop song sharing a link with Brigitte Bardot, who inspired the original writer of Initials BB by throwing the book *L'Amour Monstre* and pointing out that each page said "whips: lash" (presumably in the form of stage instructions, though the wiki article isn't clear). This would explain the video's lashings. The song's lyrics themselves are from Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven". I assume a deeper knowledge of the book, the poem, and how the original song came to be would help to explain the video a lot more.
p1710
aVThat's a lot of boobs.
p1711
aVYet not enough.  Needs more imho, for purely artistic purposes of course.
p1712
aVKudos to them for finding theme-accurate (if stylized) military hardware! The airship's superstructure is a simplified version of the German battleship [Bismarck's](http://www.esys.org/stories/Aktstory_Bismarck_Schlachtschiff.jpg) and the aircraft look like they're German Bf-109s, which all fits perfectly with the whole Nazi theme.\u000a\u000aIncidentally, I'm building a model of Bismarck right now...

aVI'd rather see an Epica headliner! 
p1719
aVI wasn't able to make it on any of their current shows so i'm kinda glad.\u000a\u000aHopefully their reschedule will make it more opportune.
p1720
aVThat sucks. I was looking forward to Epica and CoB on the same bill. \u000aOh well. Still have Delain/Sonata Arctica, Lacuna Coil and Within Temptation to see this month. \u000a\u000aIf they tour next year it will spread the awesome out a bit. 
p1721
aVI feel bad for the band right now. They're obviously pretty angry and sad. I expect it costs an awful lot to plan a while tour and then cancel it, plus I'm sure they were looking forward to it and it must mess up their plans a lot.
p1722
aVI'm sad and relieved at the same time because the same night that show was in Denver is the same night as the Sonata Arctica/Delain/Xandria show.
p1723
aVI just went to that show a couple days ago. Xandria was good and Delain fucking killed it! 
p1724
aVI have yet to see Xandria live but I saw Delain open for Kamelot last year and they were amazing.

Also not much point in getting We Will Take You With Us but it's a personal mission for me to own as many versions of Cry for the Moon as possible.
p1739
aV"We Will Take You With Us" is excellent though. I like it a lot better than the original recordings.
p1740
aVOh really? I assumed it was more or less the same but I did prefer the mixing and choir on Cry For The Moon. I'll have to get it. Sadly the DVD is extortionately expensive but the CD is more reasonable.

p1758
aVThanks for the link! For some reason the official Tuomas page had the announcement up before the Nightwish one.\u000a\u000aNuclear Blast EU have a code for \u20ac3 off shipping for today only: 5C20IY15K5\u000a\u000aPretty annoying since I ordered it earlier before they announced the code!
p1759
aVNow comes the decision of whether to wait till it arrives at NuclearBlastUSA...the 3-Euro discount doesn't do much for a 22-Euro shipping fee =(
p1760
aVI think I would wait and see what the Nuclear Blast US special edition is, it could be something cool. It should be up there soon.
p1761
aVShiny.\u000a\u000aI really like the cover art and the title.\u000a\u000aIt's also coming earlier than I expected.\u000a\u000aCan't wait to see the tracklist and to get some samples.
p1762
aVI know I'm probably in the minority, but I don't really like this. The album art is too dark and the 3D rendering reminds me of the [horrible Iron Maiden cover](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61tNk9h19kL.jpg). Then there's the title. "Endless Forms Most Beautiful" doesn't really make sense when taken at face value and just sounds really tacky; "Journey of Grandeur" would have been a far more superior title, imho. I really hope the music is at least good. If it is, I can probably look past all of this. 
p1763
aVYou are literally judging a book by its cover.
p1764
aVYou are completely right and I admit that I am judging it by its cover. Like I said, the music is more important. If the music is good, I can look past the album art and title.
p1765
aVI think the title is lovely, but I'm not that keen on the cover art either. I was hoping for something more colourful, and the digital art doesn't look great close-up. I do like the kind of glowy/sparkly effect at least... I expect it will grow on me, anyway.

aVSame! It was linked on the Nightwish forum so I expected the music, but I wasn't expecting the words to sync up...
p1770
aVIt was dramatic but dumb at the same time... I haven't seen the show but the song is awesome and it make it seem cool. It was like... lip sync without the sync.

Here are my top contenders to consider (in random order):\u000a\u000a* Epica: ***Retrospect*** - a three hour long (!) live album celebrating 10 years of Epica\u000a* ReVamp: ***Wild Card*** - it's great to see ReVamp going on, despite Floor Jansen being so busy\u000a* Leaves' Eyes: ***Symphonies of the Night*** - their best (and heaviest) album yet, I personally think the title song is Liv's greatest performance ever\u000a* Nightwish: ***Showtime, Storytime*** - an incredible performance of my favourite band with my favourite vocalist, this obviously has my vote for the year\u000a\u000aAnd for the sake of completeness I'll mention these too:\u000a\u000a* Within Temptation: *Paradise (What About Us?)* - not a full album, only an EP, but I wanted to mention it since it gave me some hope Within Temptation is moving back towards symphonic metal\u000a* Tristania: *Darkest White* \u000a* Tarja: *Colours in the Dark*
p1778
aVWe can use this reply to ponder :D\u000a\u000aI just want to get a general idea of what /r/symphonicmetal deems the best album of 2013.\u000a\u000aAlso, you can always upboat more than one album, but that would kind of defeat the purpose obviously heh. 
p1779
aVI think Sirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue and Serenity - War of Ages are strong contenders too :)
p1780
aV&gt; Live albums allowed\u000a\u000aIt has to be Showtime, Storytime.
p1781
aVAgreed! I don't usually like live albums much at all but both Showtime, Storytime and Retrospect are great this year. But SS is definitely the one I'm going to listen to most, I just adore Floor's versions of the songs.
p1782
aV**Amaranthe - The Nexus**\u000a\u000aDo they count as symphonic? not sure. If not: **Serenity - War of Ages**
p1783
aVReVamp - Wild Card\u000a\u000aAfter mulling it over, I personally think this is the best symphonic metal album of 2013.. tho one could argue that it's prog metal I guess hehe.
p1784
aVFleshgod Apocalypse's "Labyrinth" has me hands-down. And I wanted to pick one that wasn't so obvious.\u000a\u000aMy second choices are Orphaned Land's "All is One" and Shade Empire's "Omega Arcane". But don't upvote this for those. \u000a\u000aEDIT: Full album link for Labyrinth: http://youtu.be/EcjfCQp6WXU
p1785
aVLabyrinth was personally a let-down for me.. Thought it just lacked energy despite being so grandiose in sound.. but the Shade Empire album was up there!
p1786
aVRetrospect for me.\u000a\u000aShowtime, Storytime is good too, but I think the show Epica put on at Retrospect is so much more fun to watch (and listen to). I think I've watched it like 3 times already and it's all I've been listening to.
p1787
aVSirenia - Perils of the Deep Blue\u000a\u000aSirenia was one of the best bands in the genre and after a bit of eclipse really returned to form with this album that sounds a lot like old-school Sirenia, but fits perfectly Ailyn's vocals and Veland's screams.\u000a\u000aEdit: [Seven Widows Weep] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCxgJFjnZw)
p1788
aVYes for sure, this band's sound is fanatic is my go to for symphonic metal since Tarja left Nightwish. God, I love Ailyn's accent, too. Her voice calls to me just like a real siren's would. 
p1789

(lp1834
VMy personal favorite album of theirs is The Divine Conspiracy.  Take that album for a spin.
p1835
aVAs a whole album it has parts I like, but it's got a lot of slow bit s. slow bits are ok, but to me it feels like it doesn't necessarily "diminish" the heaviness of the album, but make heavier parts seem unecessary.\u000a\u000aButs \u000a\u000aIn other words, I feel like it doesn't fit together.\u000a\u000aThere are definitely songs I like individually. 
p1836
aVI found if I listened to the album by starting with the final track then going back to the beginning, it seemed to flow better - less interrupted. But that's just me. It took me ages before I would even listen to the slow songs like Safeguard to Paradise etc. Just skipped them.
p1837
aVMaybe it will grow on me.
p1838
aVI know how you feel. I thought Epica's earlier stuff was pretty average compared to the later albums at first, but after several listens of Divine Conspiracy, it became a favourite. TQE is still #1 in my books, but TDC has something else that I really love and always go back to.
p1839
aVWhat other bands have you listened to?\u000a\u000aCheck out these threads from a few days ago and see what you like there:\u000a\u000ahttps://pay.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/2chd6e/big_4_of_symphonic_metal/\u000a\u000ahttps://pay.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/2dnd5u/pick_no_more_than_5_songs_that_you_think_best/
p1840
aVYeah I've at least listened to the top songs of the bands people like. I'm still listening.
p1841
aVI can see why you'd feel like that, it's a very high quality album and there's not really anything quite like it. But there are things to love about other bands/albums too. I love Nightwish's lyrics and beautiful compositions, I love Sharon's voice in Within Temptation, I love how Leaves' Eyes evoke scenes of ancient Norse history.\u000a\u000aI remember when I first got into the genre it was with WT's The Heart of Everything and Nightwish's Dark Passion Play. No other albums compared to those at the time for me. But eventually I saw what was great about the old stuff, and of course there were new albums that surprised me too. I think this genre is full of wonders if you stick around and explore!
p1842
aVIt sounds like you need some time to adjust. Don't sweat it if you can't jump right into the genre pool. Take it a little at a time. \u000a\u000aWelcome to the symphonic metal family.
p1843
aVHaha, thanks. We'll see if it grows on me.
p1844
aVHere are some tunes if you want to help expand your horizons:\u000a\u000aNightwish - "Storytime"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvkYwOJZONU\u000a\u000aWintersun - "Sons of Winter and Stars" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMbFu457jGs\u000a\u000aWhispered - "Lady of the Wind" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bg-1zM1x-c\u000a\u000aEdenbridge - "Alight a New Tomorrow" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZi4cDjHTo8\u000a\u000aEach one varies in style. Each band has their own unique formula that's quite distinguishable. If you need any more suggestions, ask around. We don't bite -too- hard.\u000a\u000a
p1845
aVThe Nightwish song is good, the next two were too "heavy" too much drums and screaming. and the last one feels kinda pop song-ey. Thanks for the recommendations. 
p1846
aVNo prob. Glad you found somethin ya like.
p1847
aVUsually takes me some time to adjust to new music. I don't really feel like I can appreciate the full force of a song until I've listened to it several times over. With the exception of a few songs of course.\u000a\u000aTry out Requiem For the Indifferent if you haven't as well.
p1848
aVJust recently listened to that one. I must have missed it earlier. I read some people didn't like that one here but I thought it was pretty good. The thing with other Epica albums is they have some songs I like and some I really don't, but on Quantum Enigma I like every song. I also find that Requiem For the Indifferent has fewer songs I dislike than the previously mentioned two albums.
p1849
aVYea song style varies in each album. They have some soft songs, some instrumentals, some heavy songs etc. I've heard that people don't like Requiem for the Indifferent, but I liked it.\u000a\u000aAlso check out After Forever, they're disbanded now, but they were good back then.\u000a\u000aAmberian Dawn is also pretty decent. I liked their stuff with Heidi more though. Their new singer has a totally different style that I don't like.\u000a\u000aJust two other band suggestions; I don't know if you've tried them though.
p1850
aVI would highly recommend After Forever's [self titled album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aW9Am0QRKI) to you! In my opinion, it is on the same level as the Quantum Enigma (it was actually my definitive favorite symphonic metal album before TQE came out). 
p1851
aVI don't think I like this one.  I didn't really like the songs until De-energized and then the weird tech solo thing put me off. Maybe some single songs are listinable. 
p1852
aVI would try Neverworld's End by Xandria.  Although it isn't as tight of an album as Quantum Enigma, I think it is a very strong, and frequently overlooked album.
p1853
aVI liked this one a lot. It all feels like it belongs together and is a good album. It feels a little repetitive and the songs sound maybe too similar to eachother. Might download this one.
p1854
aVTry The Silent Force, The Heart of Everything or The Unforgiving by Within Temptation. Those are slightly different style-wise from Epica, but no less awesome.\u000a\u000aI can definitely empathize with your situation though - I haven't been listening to many other albums since I first found The Quantum Enigma. Reverence is a particular favorite of mine.
p1855
aVI love that one. Second stone too all of the songs so good
p1856
aV*As time goes by, I hide the truth,*\u000a*cannot stand myself with a broken shelllll*\u000a
p1857
aVLol are those the lyrics? I've literally never listened to the lyrics of a song.  I like the singing but for me you may as well just go La la la. 
p1858
aVYeah, the chorus part!\u000a\u000aTo each their own, I suppose.
p1859
aVThe first two After Forever albums are basiclaly proto epica seeing that Mark Jansen was the driving force in those albums. \u000a\u000aYou should look into those also.
p1860
aVTry listening to Design Your Universe and Requiem for the Indifferent more. Those albums aren't as consistently great as TQE, but they have some masterpieces in them (Kingdom of Heaven, the title tracks, and Serenade of Self-Destruction come to mind).\u000a\u000aAlso, try listening to After Forever (mainly Decipher, Invisible Circles and the self-titled album), as well as Sirenia (At Sixes and Sevens, and Perils of the Deep Blue are amazing albums).\u000a\u000aYou may also like/love the latest 3 Nightwish albums, the latest 4 Kamelot albums and the latest 4 Within Temptation albums.\u000a\u000aThere's a lot to explore in symphonic metal! You got "spoiled" by TQE (which is an excellent album and extremely hard to top), but there's a lot of amazing symphonic metal in other albums/bands too.\u000a\u000aHave fun =)
p1861
aVwell lets come at the problem from a different direction.  What do you, or did you, currently listen to and love? pop? metal? screamcore? nu-wave stuff? \u000a\u000aThere's a lot of smaller bands that cross over so if we know what you liked, we can perhaps offer something more than the big 5 or 7 bands that everyone throws in.
p1862
aVI go through phases where I don't even like music. I mainly listened to Ozzy Osborne and Avenged Sevenfold. Some Metallica and a few songs here in there from other rock/metal bands. Also I sometimes just go to last.fm and play random classical music.
p1863
aVyou sound a little like me. someone who likes a guitar sound with a bit of strings and melodic voice thrown in. I would suggest you try,\u000a\u000a[The murder of my sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUwo2MaNDrk), two albums so far but they sound like they could grow into something good.\u000a[Lacuna coil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB9LXpO6yWo) have some great songs and have been going long enough to be established. [Xandria's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y) latest is definitely worth checking out but their latest album is very different to their first three or four so I wouldn't go back unless you want something  a bit different. [Delain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubi1m5pR3hM) have some good songs worth listening to, although for me they are one of those bands who can't seem to do a consistent album.  Finally, and going out on a limb, if you fancy something a bit different try [amaranthe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y25snz83ms), a bit poppy but very high energy.\u000a\u000a
p1864
aVAmaranthe was sort of my gateway between Avenged Sevenfold and symphonic metal, wasn't really into female singers before. Great suggestions.
p1865
aVI have listened to ALL of Epica's studio albums so many times I can't count and sing and growl along with them. I can see why you may be having problems as the Quantum Enigma is very unique. The mixing/mastering was the best in any of their albums. Did you know about the bonus tracks? I actually think some of these are better than most of the album songs. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN4DNVPfwXE\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1L9OBtJYac\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZU5Mi0REw4\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyYSztHaXQE\u000a\u000aPersonally, Requiem for the Indifferent is my favorite of all their albums, but it took a while to grow on me. I think all of their music is kind of like that. If you hear TQE first, you may not like "classic" Epica as much, as TQE was really a huge deviation from their earlier style. The same instrumentation, singers and genre, but that's about where the similarities stop. \u000a
p1866
asVGood Xandria Songs

(lp1868
VAll of Neverworld's End
p1869
aV"Ravenheart" is a good one. I'm also a big fan of their album Neverworld's End, specifically the songs "A Prophecy of Worlds to Fall", "Forevermore", and "Blood on My Hands". Note that they've changed vocalists a couple times.
p1870
aVMy personal favourite album is their first, *Kill the Sun*. Favourite song from it: *Calyx Virago*. I like that they were not typical Symphonic band and they were unique. \u000a\u000aFrom the albums with Lissa, I like *Firestorm*, *Eversleeping*, *India*, *Return to India*, *Winterhearted*... The list goes on, but they are pretty much all good. After Lissa left and Manuella stepped in on *Neverworld's End* they became more mainstream SM band, but good mainstream. Songs like *When the Mirror Cracks* and *Soulcrusher* are wonderful, refreshing and really good. \u000a\u000aThey are a good band, but with a curse of a front woman, which is something almost all bands of this genre have. Now Manu has left and Dianne took her place, but after hearing some of the new songs, I have to say I am not impressed. She doesn't have the vocal range like Manu or that sensibility of Lissa, but now I am just ranting... \u000a\u000aAnyway, just give a listen to the songs I suggested and have fun. Also, let me know if you want to know more.
p1871
aVAbsolutely India. Neverworld's End is a masterpiece, but India is the song that made me fall in love with them.
p1872
aVTo echo what everyone else is saying: all of Neverworld's End. /u/Alphen nailed what are probably the three best songs on the album.\u000a\u000aFrom their older albums with Lisa, Ravenheart and Now &amp; Forever are pretty good.
p1873
aVA Prophecy of Worlds to Fall.
p1874
aVSoulcrusher!
p1875
aV[In Love With The Darkness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7yj4ODmxyc) is really good too
p1876
aVMost of Sacrificium is amazing in my opinion.  I saw them in Philly at the Trocadero on 5 September with Sonata Arctica.  Most of what they played was from Neverworld's and Sacficium.  My personal favorite at the moment is Nightfall.  It's really over the top and just hits like a freight train.

(lp1885
VLove that album so much. Really hoping they are, in fact, keeping to that spirit for the in-progress album despite the departure of Manuela. 
p1886
aVThere are songs on this album that are so close to old Nightwish, I'd swear they were from the old discography. It's good to be original, but sometimes a band duplicates a sound so flawlessly, even improves on it, you can't help but love it to pieces. 
p1887
aVI also adore this album, but I'd be interested to see them try something a bit different for the next album. I mean, they tried to sound like Nightwish and they pulled it off flawlessly, but if they experiment a bit more it could create something new and interesting.
p1888
aVI think they will be forced to anyway, since this singer has already left and been replaced. Something odd about this band, they never seem to hold down a singer. 
p1889
aVtouring is hell, i have notice that most female singers end up having issues with it over time. Unless their name is Floor Jansen, but even she burnt out at one point. 
p1890
aVAnd now she is on her way to do that again. She is now lead singer for Nightwish and lead singer, composer and lyric writer for ReVamp.
p1891
aVbut we will get amazing music from her for the time being.

p1898
aVYea the album isn't my favorite. The only songs I like off of it are this one and Serenade of Self-Destruction.
p1899
aVI think the mixing/mastering on it is strange. I've heard a lot of people criticising that. They improved it massively for TQE at least.
p1900
aVAbsolutely. The Quantum Enigma was a masterpiece, such a fucking good album with a massive sound. Epic!
p1901
aVAgreed, the tone of the guitar sounds quite weak, and Mark's vocals sound quite different. I'd love to hear the songs redone with a different sound
p1902
aVMaybe that's why they got a new mixer for TQE

asV[discussion] Most romantic symphonic metal song? Romantic in the 18th century art sense, and/or the modern love-love sense
p1911
(lp1912
VI'm not exactly sure what you mean by "18th century art sense", but I'm gonna throw "[White Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItWW7nGMI0s)" by Epica in here. It's got a vocal duet by Simone Simons and Tony Kakko (of Sonata Arctica), and it's one of the best ballads I've ever heard.
p1913
aVHaven't been able to listen to much of Epica's music (beyond Divine Conspiracy, the only album of theirs I own)... but, this is amazing, and makes me want D.Y.U. even more! (I'm a huge fan of S.A., so that definitely helps.)
p1914
aVAs another huge fan of Sonata Arctica, you might like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUVn6eTBAGY).
p1915
aVOh. My. Gods... that was AWESOME! Thanks for sharing that! :D
p1916
aVHeh. I find that so strange. From all of Epica's music, I'd rank White Waters as one of their worst ones. I also don't like Tony Kakko's voice, so that probably has something to do with it.\u000a\u000aBut they do make some amazing ballads though.
p1917
aVI've always been partial to [Within Temptation - Somewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEq4ipHJ6Mo).
p1918
aV[the haunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lecZ8UnsjLs), by Kamelot and Epica\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is very tragic but very beautiful
p1919
aVThe first one that came to mind for me is Nightwish's While Your Lips Are Still Red - http://youtu.be/smiFk6KHr_8
p1920
aVGood song by my favorite symphonic metal band in the world, but not a symphonic metal song. 
p1921
aVPersonally, I think we have to accept that ballads and soft songs are as much a part of the genre as the heavy songs are. They just come from the symphonic/classical inspired side rather than the metal side.
p1922
aV[over the hills and far away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8gXzDLNWl8) \u000a\u000aWhile this is actually a cover, the nightwish version is beautiful
p1923
aVOh, I enjoy this one a lot as well. It is such a romantic idea, to seek a partner beyond social boundaries and desire her enough to be jailed for it. 
p1924
aVI never picked up on the social boundaries part of it.\u000a\u000aThe song is basically a simplified version of The Count of Monte Cristo, a  story I consider to be the pinnacle of classical Romance
p1925
aVMy favourite is probably Xandria's ["Sweet Atonement"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BOixDffEnI), though it's rather sad and doesn't possess much in the way of metal instrumentation. \u000a\u000aDiabulus in Musica's ["Eternal Breeze"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aCTLyFcbII) is also very nice, though it's more about the passing away of a loved one than their time together in life...\u000a\u000aAnd for one really obscure band, At the Lake's ["White Angels"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PD_NNMUlh4) is fantastic and has one of the best "stories" I've ever seen.\u000a
p1926
aVGotta throw out there Within Temptation's [Swan Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u76STEGlCXk), probably my favorite romatic song.
p1927
aVI'm not sure if these count but how about Within Temptation's [Hand of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDhbewTR_vg) or [Truth Beneath the Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiQrm6nOyQ8)?\u000a\u000a
p1928
aV[flag in the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObI4XuTR2o) \u000a\u000aI love Sonata, but this song is my favoruite. I am in a LDR due to my work, and it makes we well up inside.

p1936
aVMajor bummer for him and the band. Still, a band that can survive two lead singer changes can probably survive a drummer change.\u000a\u000aFor Kai, I guess when the biggest name in your country asks you to play with them you jump at the chance.
p1937
aVI'm so sad about this. I really hope they can help him out. Perhaps a break from the band will be the change he needs.
p1938
aVGood news: Kai Haito of Wintersun gets to help by Jukka's request. I can't wait~

aVShe is the singer nightwish needs right now, but Nightwish would have never became what they are now with her.\u000a\u000aHer voice is great but not as special as Tarja's (or even Anette for that matter, even if I can't stand it ...).

VEee, Alissa is my favorite!\u000a\u000aThose are some great pictures, it looks like you had a fun time! I missed them when they came to tour in the city here... :( I'll catch them next year!
p1964
aVAlissa was SO nice!! We talked about makeup, haha. They were all extremely kind and were more than happy to chat, take pictures and sign whatever asked. Their show was spectacular, they opened with Torn and HOLY SHIT. You can't miss them next time. And remember, never buy those VIP tickets, that is bs. Wait by the tour bus after the show: it's free and you get to actually talk to them, rather than being rushed for a picture and that's it. :)
p1965
aVAhh, that makes me really happy! I've seen lots of comments on her facebook page saying she is really standoffish when she's doing meet-and-greets, so it's nice to hear someone contradict that!\u000a\u000aI'm not too familiar with Kamelot, but I've heard their shows are fantastic. I'll definitely go next time!\u000a\u000aAre VIP tickets really bad? The last VIP experience I had was great. We met with the band an hour and a half before they went on stage. I talked to them for at least 45 minutes and got pictures as well. Strange. Well, I'll definitely hang out by the tour bus next time for sure!
p1966
aVI've never bought VIP tickets because I just wait by the tour buses. By talking to people who've bought the tickets, specifically at the Kamelot show, they said Kamelot didn't talk much, just posed for pictures, etc. Given the alotted amount of time to pose with 50+ people before showtime isn't much. I talked with their drummer Casey a good 20 minutes.\u000a\u000aI'm not saying never ever buy the tickets, but I find them highly necessary. It was like $65 or so for Kamelot's VIP tickets. I paid $24 for a regular ticket, and after waiting for a while, got exactly what everyone who paid $65 for got, and a longer chance to speak with them. 
p1967

aVOh, she was so sweet! She asked me if I was a makeup artist- which I was EXTREMELY flattered by. Very down to earth, a pleasure to talk to. She's adorable.

p2036
aVThank you very much, it's really lovely to hear that.
p2037
aVThat was an interesting read, thank you for writing this! When I think about categorizing the history of symphonic metal I make similar divisions to yours. The mid-90's where Therion and Theatre of Tragedy shape the genre followed by the late-90's where Nightwish and Within Temptation take it to international commercial success. I was in the early years of high school when *Oceanborn* and *Mother Earth* came out. I've been hooked ever since! \u000a\u000aThere's a minor thing I disagree with in your description of *Therion's* Theli:\u000a\u000a&gt;This marked a turning point for the band (who had previously only played death metal) \u000a\u000aI would argue two of their earlier albums *Lepaca Kliffoth* and *Symphony Masses: Ho Drakon Ho Megas* are steps towards symphonic metal. Even if you'd classify *Theli* as the first true symphonic metal album (which I could agree with), it's still incorrect to describe these two as death metal.\u000a\u000aAnd a small typo:\u000a\u000a&gt;Nightwish's main main Tuomas Holopainen\u000a\u000a"main main" --&gt; "main man"
p2038
aVAha, good point, I think I will edit that accordingly to try and make it clearer that their sound evolved over time rather than going from death metal to symphonic. Thanks! And good spot on the typo.\u000a\u000aMany thanks for reading, really glad to get feedback from people.
p2039
aVThanks for the good read. I got into symphonic metal back when Nightwish released Once, and after that I became totally hooked. I found a few names I wasn't familiar with in the article, which I am now going to have to go investigate :)

asVSub-genres
p2042
(lp2043
VThey aren't gothic. Like at all. Gothic is Type O Negative, Sirenia, Moonspell, Tristania, Draconian, all those. I would call them Symphonic, honestly. Just that. There are plenty of influences, but I don't feel like any of them make enough of an impact to bring them into another genre classification.\u000a\u000aI'm super anal about my genres/subgenres/classification too :)
p2044
aVI would just label Epica as symphonic, I think. They don't have many elements that strike me as particularly gothic or power metal these days, though they are fairly progressive. But in general I would just say they are a perfect example of a symphonic metal band.
p2045
aVFair enough, I've done that with other bands too that don't really have a specific style to fit into (just labeling as Symphonic Metal, that is).
p2046
aVI would definitely label Epica as Symphonic Power Metal. They are much more bombastic and fast paced than bands like Sirenia, Tristania and The Sins of Thy Beloved.\u000a\u000aI'm working on several ways of categorizing symphonic metal, will hopefully get around to finishing and posting it within a couple of weeks.
p2047
aVThat's pretty awesome, feel free to message me with questions/ideas because I'm trying to do the same, as I mentioned. Simply because I like to try to compare music, and it's not fair to compare a catchy pop song by Maroon 5 (yes, I admit to liking pop as well &gt;.&gt;) to a song by Sirenia or Epica.
p2048
aVBest descriptor (IMO) for Epica is Symphonic Progressive Metal. \u000a\u000aSums up most of their discography, I think, and even though some of their more recent work has a few death metal elements (Martyr of the Free Word and Kingdom of Heaven, for example), it's not enough to make them a Symphonic Progressive Death Metal band (heh). \u000a\u000aThat would be MaYaN, actually.

VThis sub gets little symphonic black in general so I took liberty of posting two songs today.\u000a\u000aSome trivia: Although Therion's Theli is perhaps the most commonly referred "starting point" for the symphonic metal \u000aas a genre, within the symphonic black niche things were already going on during that time. Aspera Hiems Symfonia \u000aalbum, from which this particular song is taken, was released in June 1996 (so three months before Theli) and some \u000aobscure acts can be dated even further back. However, they were all performed in a relative isolation and their \u000ainfluence on other bands was minimal when compared to the big early trio of Therion/Nightwish/Within Temptation, \u000awhich is probably the reason why there are rarely considered canon (from the symphonic point of view).

(lp2081
VI think that a lot of people haven't been properly exposed to classical music or opera. I think this is even true for some metalheads. Metalheads are some of the most elitist assholes and are not open to expanding their listening to other music. When I was growing up, my mom would listen to a bunch of operas (like The Phantom of the Opera and Les Misérables) and I even saw them live as a child. I didn't really listen to classical music that much growing up but I would definitely use it when I would study because it helped me stay calm and relaxed so I learned to really appreciate the beauty of orchestrations and choirs.  \u000a\u000aMetal, on the other hand, I have been a fan of for a long time. I started listening to thrash and death metal at an early age and then branched out to power, prog, folk, symphonic, etc. When most people hear "metal" I think they automatically think of brutal fucking metal that's going to eat your guts out, and that's not always the case. So right off the bat, people view metal as being somewhat taboo.  \u000a\u000aTL;DR I don't think many people appreciate classical music and have a negative connotation of metal. So together they can't grasp the concept of symphonic metal. Just my opinion.
p2082
aV&gt; When most people hear "metal" I think they automatically think of brutal fucking metal that's going to eat your guts out\u000a\u000aWhen you take this into account, hearing the term "symphonic metal" is almost an oxymoron. How can such scary music be mashed up with something traditionally known to be refined and formal?

aVLori Lewis' intro to Scharzalbenheim is incredible.
p2087
aVI usually describe symphonic metal to people by saying it's basically a metal subgenre that adds elements of orchestral and classical music, usually with female vocals and choirs.\u000a\u000aLike a mix of the beauty of classical/orchestral stuff with the brutality and intensity of metal music (which in itself is related to the whole symphonic/gothic metal concept of the "Beauty and the Beast" vocal approach).
p2088
aVI usually just tell them it's opera music played with guitars and electric bass. They seem to get that. If they're more interested I'd go into it deeper, but so far that hasn't happened. :/
p2089
aVSpeaking of that A-Ha! moment.  Mine was when Metallica of all bands released  the S&amp;M album.  Orchestra and Metal, together?  Holy fuck!\u000a\u000aYou could almost use that example of a gateway album.  Even people who do not know metal know Metallica.\u000a\u000aOr you can just say it's metal + Orchestra (Like an awesome film or game soundtrack) + Opera style singing (like Phantom of the Opera).\u000a\u000aI personally wouldn't use the Evanescence example, but that's more of a pet peeve of mine, more than anything.
p2090
aVI've had very mixed results in the UK! Depends who you're talking to, I guess. People I meet in metal pubs/clubs would generally know the main bands, but sometimes they've been quite rude about it - one time a guy asked me who my favourite band were. I said Nightwish. He actually turned around and walked away. Lovely...\u000a\u000aGenerally if people don't know the genre at all, I go with "it's a bit like Evanescence". Most people get the idea then. If they're more interested I might explain properly, but otherwise I just leave it at that.\u000a\u000aI try not to judge how people will react beforehand, though. My editor totally surprised me this week by saying she knew Nightwish and enjoyed watching them at a festival. Equally I met a couple of people in uni that I would never have guessed were fans. That's always a nice surprise! \u000a\u000a
p2091
aVIn the Netherlands we are lucky because pretty much everyone here knows Within Temptation. Then again, I always feel the need to follow it up by explaining that there are (imo) far superior symphonic metal bands.
p2092
aVMan, you think symphonic metal is hard to describe? Try art metal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46U2y-lO344\u000a\u000aAs for the "don't try and make people listen to this if they're listening to x", well.. some music is acquired taste, some not. I wouldn't expect most people to like Kamelot, I can think of a few Epica songs a lot would like. You can put some shit on like Metallica S&amp;M album and most people who are into metal will like that. It varies, not all symphonic metal is the same after all!
p2093
aVOh yeah, avant-garde stuff can be pretty mindboggling. UnExpect and some Diablo Swing Orchestra stuff mix so many diverse musical elements that it's tricky to define their style in a general way.
p2094
aVWow, holy shit, thank you for that link. I think I've discovered new music I must acquire.

p2096
aVI LOVE Unexpect. Never heard the term 'art metal' before - but I guess you're not wrong.
p2097
aVThat and "avant-garde metal" are the terms I've heard describe it. Art metal sounds a bit less pretentious though, heh.
p2098
aVI'm pretty sure they both sound pretentious. Then again, when you're trying to discuss *any* metal subgenre with an outsider you sound pretentious. Doesn't stop the music from being excellent though.
p2099
aVI already liked orchestral music and i had a stupid emo phase in high school so I had no aversion to symphonic metal at all. Even with harsh vocals. My friends that i introduced the music to all loved it. I suck at describing things but i just let them listen (force them to listen to my cds while in my car) and the music speaks for itself. Then i drag them to shows with me and it's always been a positive experience :) 
p2100
aVI just link them songs
p2101
aVIt is definitely hard to introduce people to the genre. I think the best idea is to sort of gradually bring them on board. You don't want to just shove them into the deepest depths of symphonic metal that we are all comfortable with, you want to introduce the elements that make the genre unique little by little. \u000a\u000aFor example, though I love these videos equal amounts (but differently), I would start people with something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDkaKpoFJV4) instead of something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmLIE6ULtyU).
p2102
aVThat's actually kinda odd. *Ice Queen* is massively more popular among the non-symphonic-metal-listening audience than anything by Epica is. I find Within Temptation much more accessible than Epica!\u000a\u000a(For example, in the annual Dutch public radio's top 2000 *Ice Queen* is the highest ranked symphonic metal song...at place 216.)
p2103
aVI am not a metal fan, but I enjoy a few bands from here or there. I got there by giving different bands a chance open mindedly at different times. Still not a fan, but now I can listen to nightwish or dragonforce or fear before or etc. I find most people hear metal and get a negative view in their mind and dont know what to do from there. They have only ever heard bad metal and never given it an open minded chance. \u000a\u000aHey to them your metal might be the bad metal and they might love evanescence. Gotta admit I enjoy the first cd still =)
p2104
aVAfter I introduced someone to Abney Park (not making that part up), they told me to listen to Nightwish. I listened to The Poet and the Pendulum, thought (originally - its one of my favorite songs now) it was ok, then the same friend told me specifically to listen to Storytime (and Imaginaerum in general) and that was basically it.
p2105
aVI just explain that symphonic metal is like orchestral music and metal having a baby.\u000a\u000aThe problem may be in mentioning 'heavy', so people have a skewed perception of it even before you start explaining.
p2106
aVI hate to say it, but I generally just say something to the effect of  "kinda like Evanescence but better." Its really the best example I can use for someone who has no idea what the hell I am talking about. Makes it even more difficult if its a band who has operatic singing AND death vocals...so Evanescence mixed with death metal is a...difficult concept to explain to most people.

aVI've been a fan of WT for about 7 or 8 years now. I love them. They even coincidentally did a song with my name in it (Sinead, which means so much to me). I had been dreaming of going to one of their concerts for so long that the day before the gig I got scared that perhaps my expectations were too high. \u000a\u000aAnd then I went and i got front row and it blew every expectation right out of the water. It was phenomenal. They didn't play my song, but I got to meet Sharon afterwards, and after I introduced myself he said "Oh, Sinead? You're the real one? You'd better stick to your guns then". I pretty much died.\u000a\u000aIt was the best night of my life. Delain are amazing, too! If you're not into Delain, get into them. They are something special.
p2138
aVAnd you're the one who's jealous?\u000aThat is freakin' awesome! And I love that song! I got the vip package for Nightwish too, so I get to meet the band! And I do really like Delain! So pumped that they're opening for NW. Who opened for WT when you went?
p2139
aVWhat can i say, I want it all. Delain opened! They're opening for everyone at the moment! I was singing along to some Delain songs and Charlotte pointed at me and started singing at me. After the show she recognised me. It was a good night.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p2140
aVMan, you have successfully doubled my hype for the show coming up! 
p2141
aVYou should be so hyped! Floor is an amazing singer and she puts on a hell of a show from what I've seen. You will have the best time :)
p2142
aVAnd "so hyped" I am! Floor is an absolutely incredible singer! Also, Marko's beards...\u000aIt is unfortunate that Jukka isn't able to play with the band for health reasons. (Unless something changes by then) however, that doesn't diminish my excitement at all! 
p2143
aVJukka isn't just on hoatus. He's had to leave the band because of his insomnia. Its really sad but be wont be back for wuite a while it seems. 
p2144
aVYeah, last I heard he was still gonna help out behind the scenes where he could. Really is sad though. All the best for his recovery, whether he returns to the band or not.
p2145
aVSeconding the recommendation for Delain, because they are legitimately awesome as fuck.  Saw them at The Grove with Xandria and Sonata Arctica, after the show when they were there to meet with people at the merch stands.  Security started shooing everyone out, and Martijn went outside with the rest of the fans sticking around to make sure he got to meet/sign for/take pictures with everyone who wanted to.
p2146
aVSame thing happened here!
p2147
aVGhost Love Score is definitely a symphonic metal staple, if not the best example of what the genre can bring to the table. The song still gives me the chills like no other :-)

p2149
aVI should have subscribed to this subreddit way sooner(I just found out it existed)
p2150
aVSo glad I found this. Have been in love with this genre for about a year (though I've listened to Nightwish for forever). I commpletely adore Kamelot, I have been listening to their entire discography on repeat for months and can't get enough of it. So many great bands here and I can't wait to find more.\u000a\u000aI can't tell the difference between Symphonic, Power, Melodic metal though.\u000a\u000aAnyway, don't know why I'm posting this, except that I don't know anyone who listens to this kind of music and needed to express it!
p2151
aVWhoa this is a subreddit? Hell yeah, I love melodic metal. 
p2152
aVA suggestion to our new friends: to find out more bands, subscribe to Napalm Records and Nuclear Blast on youtube. These are two of the biggest labels for symphonic music, and they have a lot of really great artists with them. \u000a\u000aMy reccomendations would have to be: Epica, Within Temptation, Nightwish (who have an amazing new singer and who are releasing a new album in 2015), Sonata Artica, ReVamp, Northern Kings, Serenity, Delain and Apocalyptica.\u000a\u000aThose are just a few of the many many bands in the genre. There are so many different styles even within the genre and it's such a kickass style of music to get yourself stuck into!
p2153
aVI can't help but feel like Amaranthe should be on this list, who have a new album coming out in about 2 weeks! Including this phenomenal single! http://youtu.be/T2e_3ZnJcTE

aVAmaranthe aren't symphonic, but hey, I enjoy them a lot. And they do often collaborate with symphonic metal bands when playing live.

sVLet Us Burn Discussion Thread
p2181
(lp2182
VI completely agree with you. Elements was such an amazing concert. It was a bit of a let down that they excluded "Our Farewell" from the track list, but other than that, it's close to reaching the quality of Black Symphony. As for Hydra, I just couldn't put myself to watch it past the first track, it doesn't seem to have that something that made their other concerts so special. 
p2183
aVYeah it's quite a shame. You can at least watch the cut tracks from Elements on YouTube. I wasn't that keen on the guest singer for Our Farewell though, although she had a sweet voice - I think I would have preferred just Sharon.
p2184
aVI preferred the *Elements* side as well, largely because them playing with an orchestra makes it that much more awesome.  Would highly recommend watching it for anyone who hasn't.\u000a\u000aOn the *Hydra* side I thought the acoustic songs were alright, though when I saw them in Toronto in October they were only playing one acoustic song, which I think worked out a little better as it was a nice change of pace, but only a brief one.  Still a great show though, my personal favourites from that one would have to be In the Middle of the Night, Paradise, and Iron.
p2185
aVI sort of wondered why they left Iron and In The Middle of the Night on the Hydra DVD when they already had great performances of those songs on Elements. Those are 2 of my favourites as well, but if they'd cut them from Hydra we could have had one of the others back, like See Who I Am or The Cross or Our Farewell... 
p2186
aVDidn't think of that, would have been great to see a few older tracks in place of the songs that are on both.  Especially given that the versions on Hydra aren't as great as the Elements versions anyways
p2187
aVHow does it compare to Black Symphony? I really like their older stuff but I'm not a fan of their last two albums. Does Elements source songs from their whole discography? 
p2188
aVThe Elements show has songs from their whole discography (it was recorded in 2012, so nothing from Hydra), and the Hydra side mostly has songs from the past two albums.  I'd say Elements is comparable to Black Symphony - also has an orchestra and is overall and awesome show, but Hydra (while still good) is definitely not as great.
p2189
aVIt's mainly material from The Unforgiving album but on the DVD there's 1 song from THOE, 3 from TSF, 3 from Mother Earth and 1 from Enter. Unfortunately some of the other older stuff was cut for time, either because it's on the Hydra disc as well or because it's been on older live recordings. \u000a\u000aI would say I enjoyed Elements as much as Black Symphony - the only problem being that I'm a huge THOE fan so I did miss those songs. But I also really like The Unforgiving so it was very cool to see those songs performed with an orchestra. \u000a
p2190
aVDamn. I was hoping to see a lot of ME and TSF stuff. I guess that makes sense, though. Black Symphony already covered a lot of THOE and previous so it would be logical to focus on The Unforgiving. \u000a\u000aI might pick up Let Us Burn if I come across it, but it's going to be hard to top Black Symphony for me. WT isn't even in my top five favorite bands, but I think that might be my favorite live DVD.
p2191
aVHave you got The Silent Force tour DVD? It's pretty epic, even though it doesn't have the orchestra etc. I think there was a Mother Earth one too, but I don't own that one.
p2192
aVOooh, no. I'll have to get that at some point. I just watched a bit of it on YouTube and it sounds good. Thanks!
p2193
aVI haven't seen it yet (though im in the front row of all 3 gigs), it has been purchased for me as a Christmas gift, so it'll be scheduled for festive viewing. Having been at the 3 shows, I felt that the concert was lacking that special feeling you get at a WT concert. It didn't seem like a WT show. It was visually impressive and we got Candles, but I hated the dancers, there was a lot of bloopers and the venue was meh. \u000aThe Hydra shows were great though on a smaller scale, and her voice was tired, I enjoyed them a lot more. 
p2194
aVI wonder if those reasons you've mentioned could be why they didn't want to release the footage for so long. They certainly seem to have cut quite a lot of the not-very-WT things. I remember thinking when I watched it on YouTube that I couldn't believe they wasted time with 3 covers and all the dancing. I do actually quite like the covers but nowhere near as much as WT's own songs, and it seemed like it was more of a gimmick to get funding from Qmusic. I watched with a friend who's really into pop and even she thought the dancing was silly, especially because they were all just wearing shorts and t-shirts and looked like they'd forgotten to get dressed properly!\u000a\u000aOn the DVD though, they cut the covers and didn't show much of the dancing. For me the DVD version seemed a big improvement, it felt more like a real WT show. Hope you will enjoy it more too.
p2195
aVit seemed more like the realising of something Sharon wanted to do, but it didn't quite work...though Sharon still loves the concert. It wasn't going to be released at all, which is why it was shelved for so long. Her dress ripped halfway through a song, the pyro going off at the wrong time etc was all a bit farcical. The covers are songs Sharon genuinely loves too, but whoever felt those dancers were necessary  (maybe Ruud \U0001f609) should have their head rapped off a wall!!!

VDefinitely another big change from their previous stuff, keeping it fresh.  \u000a\u000aI'm a fan of this though, the samples, at least lorraine, seem much more operatic (ie: storytelling), which is a hugely welcomed change.  The composition is more metal-based by the samples, but we'll see what it's like overall. 
p2238
aVI've never really listened to them, aren't they usually more folk metal? This sounds a lot like Neverworld's End Xandria (which is a good thing).
p2239
aVThey said on Facebook that this album's theme is based on the Victorian gothic novel Carmilla, whereas usually their albums are based on Nordic culture/mythology, so I suppose that could be why it sounds less folky than their previous records. :)

aVNjord is the crown jewel of symphonic metal, and Meredead is a really lovely blend of symphonic metal and folk.

p2246
aVMy favourite album is 13th Floor. It's the first album of Sirenia I've ever heard and it stuck with me. I also like The Enigma of Life. I don't see why people dislike it. I really enjoy all songs, they are not great, but they are good. 
p2247
aVI absolutely love the intro (Ducere Me in Lucem), and apart from that, my favorites are Seven Widows Weep, Profound Scars, and Blue Colleen. Overall, I like this album a lot more than any of their others.
p2248
aVI really love the album. Their others all had individual songs that I liked a lot, but I never listened to them much as a whole. I agreed with many other people that The Enigma of Life was a bit of a disappointment, though again there were a few songs I loved. Perils of the Deep Blue is just such a big step up, it's cohesive and atmospheric and Ailyn has improved her vocals no end. It's definitely a contender for their best album!
p2249
aVI haven't listened the album much but I like it more than The Enigma of Life which was quite terrible in my opinion.\u000a\u000aI have liked what I've heard from Perils of the Deep Blue except the sound on the album is bad in my opinion. Bass and guitar don't form an unified 'wall of sound' like for example on Nine Destinies. Also the drums sound plastic and quite lifeless compared to Nine Destinies or the albums before it. The 13th Floor also suffers slightly from the same issue but it isn't as notable on it.

aV[Turisas - "Miklagard Overture"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OQ_hQXRRMA) - most representative of the epic saga style, with clean and harsh male vocals in even distribution, full orchestral arrangement, and choir.\u000a\u000a[Epica - "Chasing the Dragon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bidIrp1gZoc) - acoustic and clean vocals that gradually transitions to the more typical heavier sound, while maintaining a clearly common melodic theme throughout. This differs from the rather more abrupt partition between "gentle' and "heavy" in Epica's newer albums.\u000a\u000a[Therion - "Clavicula Nox" live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLcuWskuFuY) - I chose this one not just to represent the ballad style, but also for the visuals to give the viewer/listening a more complete experience as to how well the genre can be adapted to a full orchestra (and orchestra only!).\u000a\u000a[Almora - "Kiyamet Senfonisi" {Judgement Symphony}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZPZ2WK6hDA) - Almora's no longer around, but for a while they were one of the best (well, perhaps only) Turkish symphonic metal bands. When it comes to symphonic metal, people usually think of Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, and some parts of East Asia - very few think of Turkey. The leader of the band continues to do orchestral arrangements after the band's disbandment. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

Despite being a subgenre, symphonic metal is very diverse and has multiple "flavors"/"sub-subgenres" to it and there are lots of great bands doing very different things in terms of style and sound.\u000a\u000aAlso, Diablo Swing Orchestra isn't really a symphonic metal band (they're really avant-garde/experimental with all kinds of different influences), but the orchestral/symphonic element is one of their main things.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVGreat topic! Hmm, like others have said, this is a tricky one because it depends who you're trying to represent it to. I think I'll go with an imaginary metalhead who is vaguely aware of the genre... And I'll try not to just pick my favourite songs!\u000a\u000a- Epica - *The Essence of Silence*. I think this is a good one for demonstrating the "beauty and the beast" style. I've found a lot of people who are into heavy music will enjoy Epica.\u000a- Within Temptation - *The Truth Beneath The Rose*. I particularly like the Black Symphony version of this for showing people how epic the music can be live.\u000a- Leaves' Eyes - *Frøya's Theme*. I kind of think almost any LE song would be a good representation of the genre but this one is just glorious.\u000a- Kamelot - *Soul Society* or Serenity - *Wings of  Madness*. Cheating a bit but I think there should be a male lead vocalist in the list and I can't pick between the two...\u000a- Nightwish - *Ghost Love Score*. An obvious one and it is my favourite song, but I think it's the pinnacle of the genre. I have a preference for Floor's version, especially the Argentina performance.\u000a\u000aApologies for no links, I'm on mobile.

aV**Epica - The Obsessive Devotion**.\u000aEpica shows some of the heavier sides of the symphonic spectrum. Really good juxtaposition of grunts and operatic vocals, and heavy on the orchestra.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Diabulus In Musica - Ex Nihilo**.\u000aLike Epica, this is heavier with the grunts and driving drums. But this song has a particularly strong choir aspect to it, which I love. Her vocals are also more airy and gentle.\u000a\u000a\u000a**Nightwish - Ghost Love Score**.\u000aWe need to throw in an epic one. This is undoubtedly one of the best. I love Nightwish because they take full advantage of choir, orchestra and woodwind section as most other symphonic bands stick to orchestral arrangements, Nightwish just does whatever they please. \u000a\u000a\u000a**Kamelot - Song for Jolee**.\u000aTwo reasons this is necessary. I want to include a male singer, and I think Tommy is the best. Also, we need a ballad. Symphonic metal, and especially Kamelot, shows a lot musical theater influence in their work and this song sounds like it could be straight out of a musical.

p2280
aVTo me it's a bit "too generic". Maybe it's just because I fear that Symphonic Metal could be drifting too much in to a mainstream direction, like WT's Hydra for example. \u000aStill, not a bad song.

p2296
aVHas anybody ever done something like this? There are probably hours of music/songs to record...\u000a\u000a(unless this is just wishful thinking, then I hope so too :D )
p2297
aVThe only band I can think of who's done something similar is Amberian Dawn, who re-recorded a bunch of their songs with their new vocalist and released it as an album: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Evolution_(album)
p2298
aVSonata Arctica also did some badass remakes of their old songs. *My land*, *Replica* and *Wolf and Raven* come to mind at least. Also *Losing my insanity* from their latest album is a revisit of an old song the Man (Tony Kakko, look him up!) wrote eons ago.
p2299
aVI was just thinking of bands re-recording old songs with new vocalists :) but yeah there are some good re-recordings in general, like Nightwish did Sleeping Sun and Astral Romance.
p2300
aVOh nice, I had never heard of them! I keep on discovering new music on this sub, thanks! :)
p2301
aVArch Enemy also did this with root of all evil so gossow would have a routine with the older songs and they could play them live without amott doing the vocals.
p2302
aVI hated this album, mostly because Heidi did a good job doing those songs and they don't really fit capri's style.\u000aI don't think nightwish should redo their old stuff mostly because Anette's style is different from Tajra's or Floor's style. They should just train on ahead and see what new things they can make with Floor.
p2303
aVI don't think they would do, because they didn't re-record any Tarja stuff with Anette, not even on a live record as far as I know (excepting the live rehearsal videos that they did of Planet Hell and Romanticide).
p2304
aV&gt; Has anybody ever done something like this? There are probably hours of music/songs to record...\u000a\u000aYes, but in a *very* different genre. :) At the end of the 70s, [Jean Ferrat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ferrat) re-recorded almost all of his songs after [PolyGram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolyGram) bought the rights to the previous recordings from his label. He did not want to depend on a major, so he created a new label, and released 11 re-recorded discs!
p2305
aVThat's dedication!
p2306
aVI would be happy with some sort of multi disc best of Nightwish remastered type of thing. Maybe 3 or 4 discs of the best music . Just start with most of the end of an era and add some newer stuff and some early stuff
p2307
aVSo where does this leave ReVamp?
p2308
aVNo reason she cant do both.
p2309
aVDidn't they announced a new incoming album ? Floor posted something about it on her facebook page not so long ago if my memory isn't failing me.\u000aAbout the remastering album tho, am I the only one who thinks that the Tarja-Nightwish albums are untouchable ? I mean, Floor is the best they can find and will do great without any doubt but ... Holy shit guys, except from certain songs (Ghost Love Score ...) which really do well considering Floor has a much more potent voice, I don't think I'll be able to ear a remastered version of Once or Angels Fall First, or even Wishmaster with any other voice than Tarja's. Well, Oceaborn is more about keyboard master pieces and Wilska so why not and Century Child is Marco's ...
p2310
aVReVamp's new album was out a while back :) It's called Wild Card. Like I said above, I don't think they would re-record old stuff with Floor because they never did that with Anette.
p2311
asVI created this video to explain what symphonic metal is: The Elements of Symphonic Metal
p2312
(lp2313
VGreat job ! Lots of nice songs for those who already know the genre (that ending, couldn't have imagined a better song to end the video), and very good choices overall when explaining each element.\u000a
p2314
aVYou point out a main aspect of this genre that i honestly dislike. Keyboards. Its a very fine line between symphonic and power metal which most bands actually sound like. I have yet to hear a real symphonic metal sound as heard in Versailles/Jupiter. They actually have songs that sound like a orchestra piece turned into metal. When i heard about this genre i was excited to find more bands like them but most sound way to power metalish. I have found a few like epica, nightwish, kamelot,  and rhapsody but thats about it.
p2315
aVI think cost is a huge factor in this - most bands can't afford an orchestra. This means that they have to use keyboards or synths for their melodies. I mean, when Nightwish started out they recorded their albums at school on almost no budget, hence why they could only use their own instruments for the most part.\u000a\u000aSometimes bands do find a way around this - especially now we have crowdfunding, more bands are going to be able to use orchestras and to learn how to incorporate them into the music. \u000a\u000aYou might enjoy the later albums of Xandria and Serenity, by the way, if you haven't heard them already - I enjoy their orchestral elements, personally.
p2316
aVI can understand that .Im really digging Serenity's newest album. Thanks for that.\u000a\u000a

p2326
aVI'll have you know that Tarja was the best singer there ever was... \u000a\u000aBut seriously, I love that Floor is now a member. I think she's an excellent singer and is the perfect person to be the lead for Nightwish. Can't wait for the new album.
p2327
aVI personally think Floor fits Nightwish better. It's a close match but listening to Ever Dream [with Tarja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJHRGyNh2h4) and [with Floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwGSAFarHRg) has settled the issue for me.
p2328
aVI completely agree with you. When I first listened/watched Showtime, Storytime I knew she was perfect for Nightwish
p2329
aVThough it also helps that the second video is waayyy better audio/video quality.\u000a\u000aEDIT: also, the other band members perform somewhat better in the second one as well.
p2330
aVOf course overall quality influences it, but I don't think it's the point. Tarja's operatic voice is excellent, but she relies on it too much. Floor is more well-rounded and her hitting all the notes at [this modulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwGSAFarHRg&amp;t=225) really impressed me.

aVAnnette never sounds very good in YouTube vids of concerts, but I absolutely love the dark passion play album, no idea how that is. I have really hight hopes for this upcoming album.
p2336
aVYes, it's a fantastic album. It's fresh but still pretty similiar to Wishmaster in terms of power etc. I also liked their newest album (Imaginaerum), although it's definitely a change in style. \u000a\u000aIMO a band needs to change styles a bit without loosing the characteristics we know and love them for.

aVNightwish's last album, Imaginaerum, wasn't that great. Even when I heard it with the movie it didn't work. The instrumentals were great, but got tiring after a while.\u000a\u000aIf by 'back to basics', they mean Tarja, I'll be ecstatic. If by 'back to basics', they mean Dark Passion Play, I'll be pleased. Anything 'back to basics' is good.\u000a\u000aThis group is the only actual metal group that I've stuck to from the first day I heard their music (Over the Hills And Far Away about 4 years ago). I have faith in this group. Tuomas has, can and will take this band places. Go Nightwish, looking forwards to your new album!
p2355
aVI quite enjoy Imaginaerum, but then I'm a sucker for the grand orchestral sound. It's great background music when you're writing that 30-page paper at two in the morning... ;)

aVIt was a good album, but there were a few songs that didn't fit with the band's reputation.\u000aTaiktalvi\u000aSlow, Love, Slow\u000a\u000aAnd, imo, it just didn't live up to my Nightwish expectations. Oddly enough, I love, love, love The Crow, The Owl And The Dove. It's the one song on the entire album (Aside from the aforementioned songs) that none of my friends expected me to like.

aVDark Passion Play was pretty good imo
p2360
aVDark Passion Play is in my top favourite albums of all time! It's also the bestselling NW album ever.

My favourite tracks would have to be The Poet And The Pendulum, 7 Days to the Wolves, Escapist and The Islander.
p2361
aVI thought Amaranth was alright, but  she tried to do the stuff Tarja did and it didn't work. The Islander is one of my favourite songs, however.

VBlah, I don't like it very much.\u000a\u000aI liked the last one a lot, even more so because it was a concept album and the songs really worked together. This seems like a clusterfuck of all kinds of styles and metal sub-genres. It just doesn't feel like one album that you can listen in one sitting. And I'm sorry to say, but some of the songs are really boring. Edge of the World, Dog Days and The Whole World is Watching have some of the dullest choruses I've ever heard.\u000a\u000aSongs I like: And We Run (didn't think I was gonna like this one), Paradise and Silver Moonlight (I think the growls were better in the demo version).\u000a\u000aMy rating: 5.5/10
p2390
aVI did really like the concept of The Unforgiving. With that album I really felt like I could get immersed in its "plot", even if only subconsciously as I never really actively thought about it. For those who know League of Legends that album strangely fits Vayne perfectly.\u000a\u000aI'll still wait and give Hydra a complete listen though.
p2391
aVThe Unforgiving has kind of ruined album releases for me. It was the first album I actually waited for before it was released, I wasn't really into following bands before that point.\u000a\u000aWhen it came out I was totally blown away from how awesome it was and since then I haven't been similarly blown away by any other album from any of my favourite artists...\u000a\u000aKnowing this, I try to be less harsh on new albums, but I still hope that someday a release will surprise me and make me feel the way I did the first time I heard The Unforgiving.
p2392
aVI don't understand the desire to do co-operative albums here. While WT have great musicians, their real strength is Sharon's incredible vocals, sharing time with other vocalists usually dilutes that. \u000a\u000aThat said, I like the album, though currently I prefer the demo versions of the individual tracks. 
p2393
aVI've listen to the album about two or three times myself. Instantly got hooked on Paradise and Dangerous from the singles. The album versions of Let Us Burn and Silver Moonlight have definitely been refined into amazing songs from the EP. Wasn't too sure about And We Run (got to hear the acoustic version in LA, and it was still beautiful), but after hearing it, instantly is going into my favorites. Edge of the World may take me a bit of time to warm up to the beginning of the song, probably cause it does contrast with the tone of the rest of the album some, but it's still an overall good song. Dog Days is definitely my least favorite just cause I haven't figured out a good way to get into that song, and their EP wasn't much better. Covered by Roses was good, but it's rhythm and beat kind of sounded like Edge of the World, but I could be crazy. The poem added a chilling touch which I did like. Tell Me Why is another great metal song from them, and Whole World is watching was probably the most beautiful of them all, hearing Sharon hit those notes at the end of the chorus just blew my mind. \u000a\u000aI'd rate it a solid 9/10, with The Heart of Everything beating it out at 10/10, but even that was over a long period of time to get there, so that means Hydra could end up a 10/10 in the future. 
p2394
aVThis might be the first Within Temptation album I didn't like, and I'm really sad about that. WT is one of the few bands that consistently put out great content that I enjoyed very much.\u000a\u000aThe entire album feels, I don't know, kind of mechanical? It's feels very generic and without theme or anything that would tie it together or create atmosphere. It's the very same feeling I had about the latest Evanescence album. It's just so *ordinary.*\u000a\u000aThe Xzibit song is horrible. His voice adds nothing to the song.\u000a\u000aThe only song I really liked was Paradise, the one with Tarja. It's actually funny that it's better than anything she put out solo in the past few years, and only reaffirms my belief that she's a great singer that needs a *band* to giude her and produce amazing content.\u000a\u000aThe first song is also quite good, as is Silver Moonlight. But only good, the rest is meh.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I'm quite disappointed. It's a very forgettable album that's only good as background for gaming or something. It's not the worst thing I heard, but it's definitely the weakest album WT ever made.
p2395
aVThe album starts of really well, the first 4 songs are awesome! 5th and 6th songs are pretty good as well. I don't really like Covered By Roses, agree with OP that it sounds generic, same goes for Dog Days, didn't like the demo and the final version isnt much better, Last 2 songs are really good, but Piotr's voice suits The Whole World Is Watching Much Better. I am kinda disappointed that there are only 10 songs though...
p2396

p2397
aVIt leaked about 10 days ago

aVYeah, listened to it today in the gym while training. Very nice album. A little more metal and less symphonic than usual, but it was still awesome. Gonna keep listening to it.
p2399
aVI'm waiting for the CD, but I've liked what I've heard so far. Looking forward to it!
p2400
aVI was disappointed.\u000a\u000a1. Let Us Burn\u000a&gt;Solid, but the demo version was better.\u000a\u000a2. Dangerous (feat. Howard Jones)  \u000a&gt;Howard Jones is terrible.\u000a\u000a3. And We Run (feat. Xzibit)\u000a&gt;The rap section is utterly unrelated to the rest of the song, which isn't surprising since rap is so far removed from symphonic metal. I tried to be open-minded but it just doesn't work.\u000a\u000a4. Paradise (What About Us?) (feat. Tarja Turunen)\u000a&gt;Tarja is a collab which actually makes sense so it's not surprising that this one is solid.\u000a\u000a5. Edge of the World\u000a&gt;Inoffensive but unmemorable; terribly generic and doesn't remind me of The Silent Force at all. \u000a\u000a6. Silver Moonlight\u000a&gt;As with Let Us Burn, the demo version was much preferable. They played down the growls which is an annoying compromise; they should have kept them as they were or got rid of them.\u000a\u000a7. Covered By Roses\u000a&gt;See #5 I suppose.\u000a\u000a8. Dog Days\u000a&gt;Quite repetitive and uninteresting. I'm not surprised by its universal dislike.\u000a\u000a9. Tell Me Why\u000a&gt;In the style of The Unforgiving but not as good as anything in that album.\u000a\u000a10. The Whole World is Watching (feat. Dave Pirner)\u000a&gt;I like it a lot! The guest dominates it so it doesn't really feel like a WT song, but it's excellent in its own right so I can't really complain. Haven't heard the Piotr Rogucki version yet.\u000a\u000a====\u000a\u000aSo basically, there's #10 and then the three other good songs have already been released in the Paradise EP (and two of them in better versions, at that.) If you have that EP already than just get the single of Whole World is Watching.\u000a\u000aIf you do get Hydra, make sure you get the demo/evolution versions of Let Us Burn and Silver Moonlight.\u000a\u000a====\u000a\u000aWithin Temptation - Hydra (2014): ***4/10***\u000a\u000a([# good songs (4)]/[# songs (10)].)
p2401
aVHaven't listened to the whole album, i'm hoping it will be availible in some store in my home town... Anyway, From what I have heard on YT its going to take some getting used to. I didn't like Evanescence's latest album until I listened to it a few times. Whats going to make it or break it for me is going to be if they can keep the message alive in all the songs, I can see a theme in some of the songs, we'll have to see if the album can bring it all together.
p2402
aVI think it's better than The Unforgiving, but not as good as their old stuff. Gotta admit I do enjoy Covered by Roses, but How We Run really doesn't work.

(lp2406
VNo, seriously, no. Given their last 2 albums they don't deserve this kind of attention.\u000a\u000aAnd seriously, the options are bad, very incomplete. They should have at least added Leaves Eyes - Symphonies of the Night, Ayreon - The Theory of Everything, Haken - The Mountain.\u000a\u000aThese all have 2013 releases.
p2407
aVUnfortunately Metal Hammer rarely pay attention to symphonic metal or much of European metal in general, really. They tend to focus on very straight-forward English and American metal most of the time, since that's what's most popular I guess.\u000a\u000aBut the quality of WT's last two albums is very much just a matter of opinion. They sold well and lots of people love them. Also I don't think there is a vote for album of the year? It's all just bands.

p2427
aVThanks! I'd really love to hear the show. Oh man, that's so awesome. I'd be pretty interested to know how they write their songs just because they fuse such different types of music and make it work - like whether they start off with a folk melody and add in the metal elements or if it all flows together from the start.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure what your time constraints are or how formal it is but maybe they'd like to answer some more lighthearted questions about what their best/weirdest/funniest experiences have been with fans/concerts etc. I'm sure they have some really good stories to tell\u000a\u000a
p2428

p2432
aVShe has a great voice, I'm still sad about Manuela though. I was completely ready for them to become my favourite band over Nightwish if their next album was as good as Neverworld's End, but with Dianne that's still possible - [me right now](http://i.imgur.com/hdW2w.gif).
p2433
aVI like the band and they have a fantastic sound, but they couldn't surpass Nightwish for me because of the songwriting. Also happy cake day. :3

aVAgreed, that's one of the first things I did "well how does this Dianne girl sound like" and was pretty impressed. I'm excited for their new album, I really hope Dianne meets (or surpasses) the bar that Manuela set. 
p2435
aVYeah, she definitely has the right kind of voice for it.
p2436
aVFYI - Dianne isn't related to Anneke.\u000a\u000aHello everyone!\u000aProbably to a big surprise for everyone in here, we are announcing Dianne van Giersbergen to be our new lead singer! Dianne, 28 years old and from the Netherlands, might be known to many from her Dutch band Ex Libris.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Dianne\u2019s arrival means the departure of Manuela Kraller, who regrettably decided to continue a different musical path. Certainly, that was a big shock to all of us hearing Manu say she wanted to try other things. With major regrets we had to let her go. Not an easy task to deal with, whilst the goal was untouchable: To continue the musical journey we had taken with \u201cNeverworld\u2019s End\u201d. But: We are very happy to have found THE new voice and face in Xandria who will continue this fantastic ride, our last album \u201cNeverworld\u2019s End\u201d had taken us to. And we are yet to sail way, way further with Dianne now!\u000a\u000aManuela thanks all fans and us in a personal statement:\u000a\u201cAfter three years with the boys in Xandria, I decided to follow a different path and go my own musical way. \u201d Manuela leaves with regret but also full of gratitude, thanking XANDRIA and fans for the time together and being grateful for the \u201cwonderful moments in mutual tours and shows\u201d. She is \u201cwishing Dianne and band all the very best for the future!\u201d.\u000a\u000aLast weekend\u2019s shows in Leipzig, Germany and in Pratteln (Switzerland) at the \u201cMasters of Symphonic Metal\u201d Festival have been the last concerts for Manuela performing together with XANDRIA.\u000aWe will certainly miss Manuela! We are also thankful for the magical time we shared and wish her all the best for the future!\u000a\u000aBUT: The show must go on and it sure will! We promise, what began with \u201cNeverworld\u2019s End\u201d was just a start and is yet to be taken to a higher level! Dianne will debut on stage with Xandria during our Spain tour in November.\u000a\u000aWe hope you all will be with us! The Dream is still alive!

asVNIGHTWISH - Èlan (OFFICIAL VIDEO)
p2441
(lp2442
VI think people were expecting a huge dramatic song to be the first thing from this album, hence the negative reaction it's getting. I was surprised myself on the first listen. However, it seemed to get better on the second and third listen, and to be honest, I think this was chosen as the first single to show the growth and maturity of Nightwish. There's alot of depth to this song, more than you realize on the first listen, and the lyrics are beautiful. They are far beyond the early power metal phase and no longer rely on pure dramatics to evoke emotion, and are showing more intelligence and intricacies in the music - they have evolved, which also happens to be (probably not so coincidentally) one of the album's themes.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: I like it.
p2443
aVEh. It's a good song, but very average. Feels like a rehashed Last of the Wilds with bits of I Want My Tears Back in it. And it's underwhelming in the same way that Amaranth is (and Nemo too, probably).\u000a\u000aI think if you compare it to Storytime, which was pretty much a flawless Nightwish single, this one is very disappointing.\u000a\u000aAlso, putting Floor singing in that very soft, restrained way feels wrong, since Floor's voice is fairly aggressive, very strong and dynamic.\u000a\u000aKinda how DPP didn't really take advantage of Anette's voice either, and it took them until Imaginaerum to write melodies and vocal lines that fit her voice perfectly.
p2444
aVIt's funny for me, reading in this thread that people think Amaranth and Nemo are boring/not as good songs, but yet for me, they are some of my favorites, right up there with things like Storytime.\u000a\u000a*shrug* To each their own. I like this new single. :)
p2445
aV[deleted]
p2446
aVNot a bad song, but kinda boring, reminds me of Amaranth a lot, a typical single for the label. Love Floor's singing though, feels very natural in the song. But... I'm sure Kai is a great drummer, but I miss Jukka going crazy behind the drums, he always showed so much energy in the videos...
p2447
aVI like it a lot because it shows a style of singing that Floor doesn't use much in her work with After Forever/ReVamp/Epica/MaYaN/whatever other bands she has worked with. I remember her saying in the pre-album documentary series on YouTube that this album tested her ability to use many different singing styles effectively or something like that, so I think this may be one song she was referring to. It's nice to hear a more laid-back (while still beautiful) sound coming from her because we already know she's fully capable of being a badass metal queen from her other work.
p2448
aV&gt;Not a bad song, but kinda boring, reminds me of Amaranth a lot, a typical single for the label.\u000a\u000aI expect that the best songs on the next album will not be the once released as singles, so I'm hopeful.
p2449
aVAs far as Nightwish singles go, I'd probably rank this somewhere above Amaranth and below Storytime. It really fits the band and is a good way to say "we're still the same Nightwish". Unfortunately, I think most fans wanted to hear "we're the new and improved Nightwish!"\u000a\u000aI think it is a mature sound and there is a lot of nuance that wasn't there in earlier Nightwish, but it is also strange for them to pick something so subdued as the first single. Good song, but I'm not sure it's a good choice for a single. I have to admit, though, that I'm a big fan of what they've done with Floor. Everyone expected big and bombastic vocals, and instead they're showing off her other skills that often get overlooked.
p2450
aVI think this is the best summary I've read so far. Well-phrased and not so reactionary as a lot of people have been. You've explained my thoughts better than I could!
p2451
aVNot using her the right way. She has the most powerful, bombastic voice of any symphonic metal singer. That's what I wanna hear.

aVI completely forgot Kai Hahto was playing on this album. I hope they make use of his skill on some of the other tracks.
p2461
aVIt's great, just as expected and unsurprisingly a "pop"-single. Solid performance from Floor and, hopefully, a promise of a really good album. 
p2462
aVI actually couldn't resist, I listened to the leaked version of this first. I have to admit that the leak sounded unfinished to me, not to mention the quality, so I was refraining from forming a true opinion until I heard it as it meant to be released.\u000a\u000aThat all said, this is significantly better. I read someone else say they could barely tell the difference. lieeees. The difference is crazy, not to mention that the leak didn't have the beautiful intro this one does. (I think it was supposed to be the radio edit?)\u000a\u000aAt any rate, I like it. I don't love it; I don't hate it. It's catchy, and different from what I'm used to hearing from Floor. I think this sounds like a song that was written with Anette's voice in mind, which is obviously a lot softer than Floor's.\u000a\u000aI also feel like I've heard this before from Nightwish, though. May be the pipes that go in similar patterns as Last of the wilds? I'm still really excited and legitimately curious for what the rest of the album has to offer. There's no way the entire thing is as subdued as this song. \u000a\u000aUnrelated to anything musical: Floor's eye makeup seems to not match on some parts of the video... drove me crazy the entire time.
p2463
aVThis is a really beautiful song exploring more mature themes and doing it well.  I think Floor really shines here.  I'm looking forward to the album.\u000a\u000aI'm surprised no one has mentioned it yet.  This song is about facing death without fear but instead with a sense of wonder for what heaven holds for you.
p2464
aVI would have said it's about embracing the life you have left, and living life to the fullest. But I'm sure everyone's got different ideas on it!
p2465
aVTuomas is doing absolutely no favors for Floor with this single.\u000a\u000aThere's a term in pro wrestling called "getting over". If someone "gets over", they get the required reaction from the crowd: a bad guy who's "over" will get booed, and a good guy who's "over" will get cheered. If you don't get the intended reaction you were supposed to get, you haven't been able to get over, and that's never a good thing in pro wrestling where good vs. bad storylines are the back bone of the entire business.\u000a\u000aThe reason I mention that is because this song isn't going to help Floor Jansen "get over". You've decided that **the very first Nightwish song** that people will hear with Floor will be as poppy and "meh" as possible. You're only hurting her popularity with the fans, especially the ones who aren't familiar with her work in ReVamp and After Forever who may not be aware of her range, power, and emotive singing. \u000a\u000aYou've got a singer who can sing incredibly heavy stuff and do growls and a drummer who is renowned for his proficiency in extreme metal and melodeath; why not release something a bit heavier to get the fans excited, much like they did with Anette?\u000a\u000aI'm sure we're all still going to listen to the album when it gets released, but it's saddening to think that Floor's legacy with Nightwish starts with this track.\u000a\u000a**Edit:** Heaven forbid someone question Tuomas and not claim he's the greatest, right?
p2466
aVNightwish actually said that they didn't want to have a single but that Nuclear Blast insisted. My guess is that the label wanted the most simplistic and radio-friendly song as is usually the way with singles.
p2467
aV&gt; much like they did with Anette?\u000a\u000ayou mean releasing a heavier song? because if so, that's not what happened. Eva was the first song released off of Dark Passion Play.
p2468
aVI was talking more in terms of the first video released, since that's the biggest source of promotion for the album.
p2469
aVI don't know about other people but my first exposure to Annette was Eva. 
p2470
aVTo be completely fair, it's not like Anette was received very well. Maybe that wouldn't have happened if Bye Bye Beautiful had been the first single.
p2471
aVErm yeah that was my point exactly. They repeated the same mistake by releasing a very soft first song for both singers. 
p2472
aVI agree wholeheartedly, and I think they were expecting Showtime, Storytime to do a lot for Annette's popularity with fans.
p2473
aVTotally agree. After seeing what Floor can do with nightwish songs from showtime, this just felt... weak. I understand this is supposed to be a nice, relaxed song, but I don't know. Maybe Nightwish is evolving into something I don't like anymore. Fuck.\u000a

p2484
aVYou have to remember that bands don't make a whole lot off the sale of their music, and in the case of these bands that are not well known in the US, they need to use anything they can to help cover expenses and make money beyond just the merchandise table. Final stop of Kamelots US tour was in Orlando and the House of Blues in Downtown Disney and was not even close to sold out. You can bet booking that location barely let them break even before merchandise. VIP tickets are simply a luxury for people willing to spend the extra money to support the band. It being worth it is truly up to you.\u000a\u000aAnd yes Tommy and Floor are excellent live.

Despite that I have purchased vip tickets for the Orlando show next year too. I hope I can get a better picture with the whole band this time.
p2485
aVI saw Kamelot open for Nightwish 2 years ago, right after Tommy joined - he is amazing. The whole band is. They were every bit as good as Nightwish IMHO. It was one of Anette's last gigs, she also impressed me. Can't wait to see Floor though on this next tour. Just check out Nightwish Wacken 2013 on Youtube. 
p2486
aV&gt;Side question - Are Simone/Floor/Tommy known for being good singers, even when live? I understand nothing is going to be studio-quality, but it's a huge let down when I listen to a band live and the singer's voice is all over the place...ruins half the song for me &gt;.&lt;\u000a\u000aI've heard criticism of Simone for her live performance, but when I saw Epica this summer I thought she did an amazing job. \u000a\u000aFloor is something special. I've never heard anyone say anything negative about her live performances. She is amazing. Best vocalist in all of metal in my opinion.
p2487
aVI've seen some older performances of Simone and it left a lot to be desired...I'm sure Floor is amazing, based on the clips I've seen from DVD's. I'm sure those are fixed up a bit (the audio) but she's still amazing.
p2488
aVI know you didn't ask about her, but I can only tell you that Charlotte Wessels from Delain is a powerhouse live. She interacts with the crowd, she belts it out, and shes lovely in person. Delain are a fantastic band to see live. Tey have ann amaing energy and really good songs. From what I've seen on youtube and heard about, Floor is amazing live, too.\u000a\u000a$180 is in my opinion a lot of money. If the band are worth that much to meet and you have the money, by all means go for it, but don't expect to be chatting to them for too long I guess.\u000a
p2489
aVIf I can get a chance to even ask one thing to one of the band members, I'd love that...but $180 is pushing it. As much as I literally regard Tuomas/Marco/Floor (Marco especially) as gods to me, I don't think $180 is within my comfortable range.\u000a\u000aI'm not as familiar with appreciating the work behind Kamelot, but $100 is closer to what I'd be willing to pay if it means to spend some brief moments with Thomas/Tommy, that'd be good.
p2490
aVI think you have your answer, then. Marco is a sweetie and I love him too, but I wouldn't pay $180 for what would only be a 2 minute chat. If I was rich I would but I'm not.\u000a\u000aJust enjoy the show, belt out your favourite tunes and if possible stalk the tour bus :P
p2491
aVI've done Kamelot and Iced Earth VIP before (though I really only did Kamelot on the slight chance that it would mean meeting Delain--didn't there, but did get a pic with her after the show!).  \u000a\u000a\u000aKamelot was a quick run by the table for autographs, then another line to get pictures with the band.  It went fairly efficiently.  I think that one was around $75-100 or so as you said.\u000a\u000a\u000aIced Earth ran the same way, but was AFTER the show.  The show ended probably around 12:30am, and the meet &amp; greet didn't happen for another hour after that, but otherwise ran the same way.  A quick run down the table for autographs and handshakes, then another line to do photos after that was done.  I think it was somewhere around $65 or so.\u000a\u000a\u000aMy brother and I both got the full VIP tickets for Nightwish minutes after they went on sale.  These are by far the most expensive tickets either of us has ever gotten for any concert.  \u000a\u000a\u000aAdding Floor is probably what sealed the deal with me.  While I've been to about 6 Nightwish concerts so far, I never saw Tarja in person--only Annette and Floor.  I saw Floor he third show after joining and she was fucking amazing.  I feel she beats Tarja hands down, and I don't think any sane person questions holding Annette against either of them.\u000a\u000a\u000aRemember, her THIRD show.  I was up against the stage by her monitor, and got a chuckle when the crew came out with their entire set of lyrics printed out on a taped up grid of 4 x 3 sheets of paper and taped it over the monitor.  The only time I heard her even slightly stumble was--I *think*--she repeated a verse on Over The Hills and Far Away.  She absolutely nailed everything else.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe only thing that bothered me was they didn't start doing Ghost Love Score with her until a few shows later (maybe even not until they got to South America).  This is by far my favorite song from them, and the only version of that I will listen to now are the live versions recorded for the album / concert video with Floor singing.  Fucking amazing.\u000a\u000a\u000aI've seen Kamelot three times, I believe all were with Tommy singing.   I was just never much of a fan and was always there for other bands.   After the third show they finally started to grow to me, so a few of their songs are on my rotation now.   The performance is great, I just didn't know the songs.\u000a
p2492
aVAs someone else said, I think it must be something they do to try and cover the costs of a US tour, because those prices both seem really expensive to me.  We bought Epica VIP tickets for only £35 (about $55). Usually I only go to free signings or hang around by the tour bus to get a signature - I know that some bands e.g. Lacuna Coil will still happily sign for fans afterwards even if they sell a VIP package. But it's up to you, if this is your only chance to get your stuff signed by Nightwish then I would say go for it.\u000a\u000aI imagine the "tour programme" will just be something similar to what you get in a theatre, a booklet with lots of photos, bits about the tour dates and perhaps interviews with band members. \u000a\u000aAs for the Epica tour, I'm sure it will be rescheduled, but probably not with Machine Head. MH have not contacted the band or apologised for cancelling the tour so Epica are very unhappy with them.  \u000a\u000aBonus question: I would say Floor and Tommy are both brilliant live while Simone is not as good (in my opinion) but improving - she had extra lessons to prepare for the Retrospect concert. You can get a good idea watching their DVDs or on YouTube.
p2493
aVWould make sense. As someone said below, their shows are often not even close to being sold out at most US places, so they basically HAVE to tack on heavy ticket prices for VIP stuff to make up for it. I don't blame them, but it is still a bit excessive for my tastes.

aVFloor Jansen, Jari Maenpaa, Tuomas Holopainen, Linus Klausenitzer (from Obscura, not really symphonic but we need a standout bassist), Kai Hahto.  Man that would rule, only had to tap 3 bands too.
p2542
aVAs with Gothic metal band Tristania and similar acts, I would like to utilize a variety of vocal styles. Here is my line-up:\u000a\u000aFloor Jansen (Femme Vox) - Esteemed for her bold, versatile vocals with Dutch band After Forever and her latest project ReVamp, Floor has also contributed her talents to such powerhouse bands as Nightwish, Epica, and Ayreon. Floor is incomparable as a singer; she has an uncanny ability to sing in operatic, Broadway, AND metal styles. Her overall image and presence make her an ideal candidate. There is no one else I would choose over her, although I bet Vibeke Stene (ex-Tristania) could more than hold her own.\u000a\u000aRoy Kahn (Male Vox - Cleans) - Roy of Kamelot has the most expressive, compelling male voice. I love contrast in my metal - the male and the female, the cleans and the screams, the lachrymose and the primal - so pairing him with both Floor and a screamer is my ideal. \u000a\u000aMorten Veland (Male Vox - Screams) - While Morten's latest projects have disappointed me a little (okay, a lot), I was always impressed with his harsh vocals for Tristania. I would have chosen Angela Gossow, ideally, but I think Morten is the best screamer in symphonic metal. His raw, almost black-metal vocals are unhindered by most growlers' mistakes (sad truth is, harsh vocalists rarely enunciate).\u000a\u000aArjen Lucassen (Guitars) - Not an obvious choice genre-wise, but his metal opera Ayreon earned him great distinction - even though his main role was as its creator. He did, however, deliver excellent progressive guitar work to Stream Of Passion (don't get me started on the name), another of his projects.\u000a\u000aKurt Bednarsky (Bass) - Kurt, the Edenbridge bassist, gives a marvelous performance every time. I love his passion and the dedication he shows towards his work. I have always been very impressed with this band.\u000a\u000aTuomas Holopainen (Keys &amp; Synths) - Who else could I choose, really? The thought of naming someone else is so ludicrous that I even considered doing so, just knowing that everyone would think I'm insane. No, but Tuomas really is the best. His style proved revolutionary to the genre (sub-genre? sub-sub-genre?), and his influences led him to create the most unique and beautiful music. He is so adept with his piano and compositions that...well, let's just say that Tuomas is one rare musician I'd call an Orpheus (read: I'd wax poetic and totally embarrass myself). :)\u000a\u000aPete Johansen (Violin) - This is a subreddit for symphonic metal, so I'm going to add this additional musician to the line-up. Pete is best known for his work with Tristania, Sirenia, The Sins Of Thy Beloved, and Morgul. I've never heard someone play a classical instrument so adeptly, and certainly not as a recurring guest musician in numerous metal bands. There is simply no way I can leave him out.\u000a\u000aWell, there's my line-up. Gods, I just about wrote a novel! LOL. :)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVSonata Arctica is really two bands; before their 2007 album *Unia*, they were standard power metal with some weak symphonic influences. Afterwards, they were a bizarre mixture of slow symphonic progressive metal with some power metal influences. I personally prefer later Sonata Arctica, here's a few of my favorites:\u000a\u000a- [Juliet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mkOadYqWt0)\u000a- [Under Your Tree](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_81wzpaNr5c)\u000a- [Deathaura](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6qrREJizY8)\u000a- [For the Sake of Revenge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbeNpJ3sIOk)\u000a- [My Dream's but a Drop of Fuel for a Nightmare](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilc-YGyncUU)\u000a- [Everything Fades to Gray](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNaLaqPJlFA)\u000a- [The Last Amazing Grays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzU65aPZDnc)

p2683
aVI know that Arch Enemy isn't a symphonic band, but this sub is aware of Alissa and this song does have some more symphonic elements, so I found it appropriate. 
p2684
aVYeah indeed, I do think it's ok. But I'm considering whether we should have a "similar genre" tag or something like that. I ended up doing that in my DeviantArt group because so many people wanted to submit stuff about other metal bands or female singers in general.

asVNightwish single "Élan" to be released on February 13th
p2706
(lp2707
VHave to say I really like the artwork. The t-shirt version is particularly cool. This is quite a big hint of what the whole album will look like.\u000a\u000aThe single features 2 additional versions of the song and a bonus track called "Sagan" - referring to Carl Sagan, I assume.\u000a\u000aAccording to Google, Élan means "enthusiastic vigor or liveliness" in French and seems to have connotations of throwing oneself into something whole-heartedly (please correct me if I'm wrong!). That would explain the meaning behind the cover art.
p2708
aVIt does.\u000a\u000aIts hard to explain, but its basically the reason you run before jumping a long distance, "élan" is what makes you go further. Can be roughly translated as "run-up"/"momentum".\u000a\u000aIts also the french for moose :D
p2709
aVThanks! And haha yes indeed, I've seen moose jokes starting up already...
p2710
aVIn their Facebook post about it, "Journey of Grandeur" was capitalized.\u000a\u000aPossible album title?
p2711
aVI don't think they'd give it away that early (come back in a few weeks to tell me if I was horribly wrong) - I'd suggest that could be a song title or a lyric, or another hint at the theme.
p2712
aV&gt;The underlying theme of the song is nothing less than the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us. It's important to surrender yourself to the occasional 'free fall' and not to fear the path less travelled by. Élan is a wonderful teaser for the full-length album, giving out a little taste, but revealing very little of the actual Journey of Grandeur to come...  \u000a\u000a    -Tuomas Holopainen    \u000a\u000aCan't wait.
p2713

aVI would order this if the shipping wasn't 150% more than the cost of the CD itself...
p2717
aVKeep an eye out for other sites doing it, which they will do soon. I bought the special edition of Imaginaerum from Nuclear Blast US because even with shipping to the UK it was loads cheaper than getting the European special edition. \u000a\u000aI've also just got membership to the EMP merch site which gives you free shipping for a year, in anticipation of all the Nightwish stuff that I'll want in 2015! Shipping costs are a nightmare and the UK isn't even far from Europe.

aVI'm going to miss Manuela's rich, deep voice, but damn that was good. The chorus sounded very Tarja-Nightwish. I'm absolutely stoked.
p2724

VWhy cant we have a concert like this in US?
p2734
aVThere certainly used to be one or two festivals in the USA that did exclusively metal with female singers, but I haven't heard anything about them recently and I think they might have stopped. \u000a\u000aThough you guys do have a couple of festivals that have a lot of symphonic metal bands that I've noticed, like [ProgPower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProgPower_USA) and the [70000 Tons of Metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70000_Tons_of_Metal) cruise. But of course it's a massive country so I guess it's difficult for people to get to any that aren't nearby.
p2735
aVWow! Blind Guardian, Therion, Apocalyptica, and Arch Enemy are doing 70000 Tons of Metal next year, and there's still over 40 bands to be announced. I really hope I can make it to that!\u000a\u000aEdit: Nevermind :( No way can I afford a $1400 ticket + plane ticket to get to Florida...
p2736
aVWould probably be cheaper to go to a European festival! Their ticket prices are cheaper at least - even a VIP ticket to Metal Female Voices Fest is only 120\u20ac (about $165). But I guess 70000 Tons is basically a full week cruise holiday as well as a festival, so it's bound to be very expensive.
p2737
aVYeah, that's a very good point! 
p2738
aVDon't know why they want to have the cruise in the middle of fucking winter...\u000a\u000aI'd love to go to MFVF or Wacken or such but you know, english, and me being a little scaredy cat.
p2739
aVHaha, well, the cruise goes to the Carribean, and it'll be really warm there at that time of year - website I just looked at said it's about 22° C which is more than warm enough, especially for a bunch of metalheads in black t-shirts :P 
p2740
aVMFVF have just said they need to wait until after [this festival](http://www.durbuyrock.be/) to announce one of the bands - seems likely it would be Arkona looking at that list? And that also they should be able to announce the full line-up in April.\u000a\u000aThey've also said that Epica aren't available this year, and neither are Nightwish, Within Temptation, Arch Enemy and Doro which is pretty disappointing. I'm hoping for some of the ias myself... as in Xandria, Sirenia, Tristania...

p2768
(lp2769
VPersonal opinion: One of the best live performances I've seen of any band.\u000aDifferent vocal style to Tarja's version but I like this more.
p2770
aVI agree. I'm not a huge fan of their recent albums, which make up most of the set list. But Floor's vocals performance is outstanding. Great DVD.
p2771
aVI adore Floor's voice and I think this whole live album is amazing, but on this song it sounds to me like she's straining, especially at the end. Disclaimer - I know nothing about the technicalities of singing, lol. I think it's possibly because it's quite high and she's trying to belt it rather than sing it in "operatic" style?
p2772
aVI can see what you mean.\u000aPersonally, it sounds to me like she's just giving it her all but I can see why that would be slightly offputting.
p2773
aVI think you're right about that :)
p2774
aVShe's actually belting the last notes, which means she's bringing her chest voice up to sing in that higher register. This is what's actually surprising about the performance because unlike Tarja, who would transition to her head to facilitate singing higher, Floor is singing with much more energy to sing those high notes with her chest voice.  
p2775
aVThanks for the explanation!

aVMy jaw literally dropped the first time I heard this.

aVI believe they go on sale around September the year before, but they always sell out quickly. I guess there might be a ticket exchange though, because there's bound to be people who can't go and need to sell their tickets.
p2821
aVThere is a \u201eX-Mas Ticket\u201d sale with reduced prices directly at the day after the festival ends and the normal tickets get sold the week after. Luckily I bought my ticket right after I arrived home because the whole thing was sold out in under 24 hours if I remember correctly.

p2851
(lp2852
VIf it contributes to the creative work, cool. If it's to be 'edgy' or make a statement of some sort, I don't want to hear it.
p2853
aVI think/ really hope Dawkins will just be there to talk about evolution/ natural history and not religion. It should be the case since the two songs he's appearing on have names directly referencing evolution.
p2854
aVI think (hope) that might be it because the name of the album references Darwin and one of the songs is about Carl Sagan. It looks like it's more about science than religion.\u000a\u000aBut then again Epica talks about both science and religion together, so maybe that's what Nightwish wants to do...
p2855
aVI'm fairly sure this is the case. Plus no-one who's listened to the album in the review sessions has mentioned him saying anything controversial, and I think it would've stood out if he had! 
p2856
aVuhh isn't this old news?
p2857
aV[Here's a brief discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/2jbl0u/richard_dawkins_will_be_heard_on_the_upcoming/) on the matter from four months ago.
p2858
aVAh I didn't know that! I had just seen it on Tuomas' page.
p2859
aVAwesome! Dawkins has a great voice for delivering spoken passages, so this makes me quite happy. One of my personal pet peeves in symphonic metal (or music in general) is English spoken passages that are written and/or delivered by people who aren't fluent in English, so it's good to know that I won't have to worry about that for at least some passages on the new album.
p2860
aVWhy is it a pet peeve of yours, if I may ask? :)
p2861
aVI also want to know. Personally, I love it when I hear somewhat broken English in a different accent sang or spoken in music.
p2862
aVMe too! it's so cool to listen to various accents, I especially like listening to Song of Myself because of that. \u000a\u000aThe part where a woman says "The first thing I ever heard was a wandering man telling his story" is my favourite, it just sounds so beautiful and melodic :)
p2863
aVI should probably note that I have no problem with accents (I think accents can actually make spoken passages better in many cases), but such spoken passages are a pet peeve of mine mostly because from my experience, ones that are written and delivered by non-fluent speakers tend to have awkward word choice and, in the worst cases, bad grammar. I like to get immersed in the atmosphere and mood of songs I listen to, and spoken passages have a very strong effect on the atmosphere of the song they're a part of, especially since there's not usually much else going on musically while they're being delivered. When done well, they can greatly enhance the the experience of a song, but if they're done poorly, it can wreck the entire mood for me. Passages with odd word choice or bad grammar will often completely break my immersion. If I'm listening to epic fantasy-themed symphonic metal, I want the lyrics to reflect the grand, larger-than-life feel of the music, and if I hear mistakes or awkward word choice in the lyrics, it's a huge buzzkill. It makes it much harder for me to buy into the image the lyrics are trying to create. Part of the problem is that good lyrics are just hard to write, even for native speakers, and part of it is that I'm unusually picky, but because it's so hard to do well, I've become generally wary of spoken passages whenever they are written or delivered by a non-fluent speaker.

aV[Direct link](https://richarddawkins.net/2015/02/richard-dawkins-to-be-featured-in-upcoming-nightwish-album/) for those that don't want to go through facebook.\u000a\u000aThis is something I would've expected from Epica. It's a bit surprising to see that from Nightwish. Must've been Floor's influence from After Forever! :)
p2865
aVHeheh, it was Tuomas's choice I believe as he's a big fan of Dawkins' books on science/evolution like the Magic of Reality and The Greatest Show On Earth (the latter which he has named a song after). Though Troy and Jukka have both worn t-shirts with Dawkins' name on as well so I think the whole band are on board with it.
p2866
aVJudging by Sagan he's a big fan of Sagan's Pale Blue Dot/Cosmos too, which is fucking awesome. 
p2867
aVWell their song, Sagan, on their new single makes reference to Carl Sagan, so it really isn't all that surprising. I'm excited to hear their new album!

aVIt was my absolute favourite when I first got into the band. Now I just think it's ok. I think it's a very straightforward and accessible song, so it has mass appeal but doesn't hold up that well against their other stuff (as is generally true of singles, I guess).

VI got sent this single as promo a while back and thought it was pretty cheesy, but now I actually really like it. It's got a fun Disney-power-metal thing going on (I won't make the obvious comparison...) Also I'm really happy to see a proper video after the recent influx of lyric videos.
p2895
aVI also noticed that. Maybe there is not enough money to make them? This and Within Temptation are rare examples of real videos that were made recently.
p2896
aVYeah, I don't know for sure but it seems like lots of record labels are favouring lyric videos as a cheaper alternative to normal videos.

aVThanks for sharing, that song's quite fun. I checked them out on Spotify and am currently listening to *The Clouds of Northland Thunder*. I like it, kinda reminds me of Edenbridge.

V&gt; how has Nightwish's live performances been so far on the current tour\u000a\u000aThe tour hasn't started yet. Once it does, though, you'll see more than your fair share of YouTube videos from the concerts, so you can just check those out to get a feel. If you don't want to spoil the setlist for yourself, I'm sure you can ask here once the tour starts and get some help from us.\u000a\u000a&gt; what exactly do the VIP tickets for the Nightwish shows include\u000a\u000aI got a similar VIP ticket for the Sonata Arctica show a couple months ago, and the poster we were given was about the size of an adult male torso. Everyone got that poster signed, as well as any CD's of theirs that they brought with themselves. The way the meet-and-greet worked for us was the band was sat behind a table and all the VIPs approached the other side of the table, handed over anything they want signed, and talked to the members for about as long as it took for them to sign what you had (usually no more than 30 seconds). After they all signed everything you had, you could get your picture taken with them, but you had to stay on your side of the table. It might be only worth the $180 if you're a diehard NW fan who *has* to be front-row, but for Sonata Arctica it was only $75, so I can't complain too much. Nightwish might have a general meet-and-greet format where everyone is in a room together and the band are roaming around freely, but it's too hard to say which it'll be.\u000a\u000aI'm not entirely sure what the tour program is, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's a small booklet with all the tour dates listed on the book, as well as multiple pictures of the band throughout it. I think it's more of a collector's item than anything else, really.
p2920
aV&gt; It might only be worth the $180 if you're a diehard NW fan who *has* to be front-row\u000a\u000aThat's where I hesitate - I love NW to death, without a doubt. The chance to meet the members (any of them, really) even if briefly is awesome. But, I'm kinda cheap, and $180 is a large price to put onto my love for the band...I've heard NW in the past is pretty friendly overall and down to earth, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was the more generic walk-around form. That's what I'd prefer, definitely.\u000a\u000aDo NW show tickets usually sell out in most places in NA? Idk if I should try to decide sooner or maybe wait for the tour to begin to get more feedback first.
p2921
aVI paid VIP for Nightwish once (it was only 80$ back then) and honestly it wasn't really worth it to me. I got a signed poster but they were very formal and you didn't really get to speak to them.
p2922
aVThis was my experience too with the VIP tickets. I'm not even sure seeing the band from the front row is that ideal, either, because tons of people will try to push their way to the front and you'll spend half the concert fighting them off... I was in the 2nd row and it got annoying halfway through the concert... Very distracting. The first few shows I went to, no VIP, maybe they were lesser known at the time, because I was able to get close to the front right away regardless.
p2923

aVBased on the many emails EntertheVault has been sending me, a lot of the VIP tickets have already been sold out, so better decide soon (or maybe it's too late anyway).
p2925
aVThis was quite helpful. Thanks!
p2926
aVI can't speak on the meet &amp; greet (I also bought VIP tickets but this is the first time I've done something like this), but I did see Nightwish live, but with Annette instead of Floor when they were in Minneapolis a few years ago right after the release of Dark Passion Play.\u000a\u000aThey were AMAZING. If anything, the DVDs and films of their live performances don't even come close to doing the actual performance justice.\u000a\u000aI don't know if you go to a lot of concerts, but one thing that really affects me, personally, when I go to a live show is the crowd itself. That electric, overwhelming ENERGY that just flows through everybody in the venue. THAT is what makes a live show so much better than watching a video online, or listening to a studio album.\u000a\u000aIt's the difference between seeing a movie at home, by yourself, versus seeing it opening night in the theater with 200 other people.
p2927
aVI've only been to one concert in the past and it was a guitarist (Joe Satriani) and we kinda just sat in the seat and listened. Wasn't anything like a metal concert is like, I'd imagine.\u000a\u000aThat is, however, what I prefer - being there is already the fun of it. I don't see the need to be in the giant huddled up crowd of people, personally - I'd rather stay back and just listen.
p2928
aVMetal concerts are a BIT more intense. :)\u000a\u000aThat being said, the venue where I saw Nightwish last time had seating in a sort of balcony area. I sat up there with my friends, drank beer and cheered and listened, and watched the crazy mosh pit below me.\u000a\u000aWhat amused me to no end was how people would go from crazy headbanging mosh-pit style action, to swaying side to side on the slower/more emotional parts of Nightwish's songs. And then right back to insane headbanging.\u000a\u000aIt was a crazy contrast and a lot of fun to watch.\u000a\u000aMoshing isn't my thing either, but it IS fun to watch and the energy is infectious. I recommend looking for a balcony or similar at your venue when you go.\u000a\u000aI'm going to the one in Clive, IA, you?
p2929
aVWorcester, MA - I don't think bands like NW usually sell out here but I'm sure VIP tickets are pretty limited at this point, so I'm trying to decide sooner than later...$180 is a lot of money, even though I do love the band.\u000a\u000aMight be able to get my parents to pay half of it as a birthday gift though, since the show is within 2 weeks of my birthday this year :D
p2930
aVCool stuff, you'll enjoy it either way I'm sure. Nightwish puts on a good show. And the supporting bands on this tour (Sabaton and Delain) are really good too.
p2931
aVI know next to nothing about Sabaton - what are they like?\u000a\u000aAs for Delain, I've listened to (and loved many times over and over) Lucidity, and I got into April Rain for a bit, although April Rain was a bit too commercial-y sounding for me to *really* get into. Haven't tried anything past there, yet.
p2932
aVDon't go VIP. Just get general admission for both shows. Kamelot is fabulous live and you can't miss them.
p2933
aVThis isn't taking travel expenses into account. 
p2934
aVThey're both coming to Worcester (close enough to drive to, even though it's a bit of a drive) within a month or two of each other, so that's definitely doable. \u000a\u000aNW &gt; KM in terms of priority for me this year, but if I can manage to afford both so close together, I definitely want to.
p2935
aVI saw Nightwish with Floor in Orlando back in 2013 and I was absolutely blown away. I expect nothing less from this tour. 
p2936
aVI would not waste the money on VIP. I did VIP on their last tour and it was the most disorganized mess I've ever seen... and I usually always do VIP....\u000a\u000athey let some of us buy merch before meeting them, then cut the rest off. the line was absolutely insane. they really barely talked to anyone (Anette was really the only one who seemed genuinely nice tbh). \u000a\u000aand for 200 bucks this time? no thanks. I'll use that money to go see Kamelot and the inevitable Blind Guardian tour as well.
p2937
aVI have seen Nightwish twice but I have never done the VIP thing although one of my best friends has and she enjoyed it but she is more of super crazed fan.  I'd love to do it but not for the price they are asking on this upcoming tour.  As far as the concerts themselves, I saw one show with Annette which was pretty good but I wouldn't call it great mainly because she never had the stage presence of Tarja.  The second show I saw was the infamous Denver show on the last tour where everything went to shit for them because that was the night that Annette was sick and the girls from Kamelot had to fill in on at least a few of the songs and the rest was pretty much crowd karaoke.  That show, especially given the circumstances was awesome and I can be seen in the front row in the documentary!  I have seen Floor with her other band, ReVamp and even though I'm not a ReVamp fan, she was great.  So, I'm sure combining her with Nightwish will make for an incredible show.
p2938
aVI saw Nightwish on their last tour in Worcester MA. Definitely one of the best concerts I've been to. I did the VIP and bought tickets for me and my girlfriend, and we're doing the same for this tour as well. Thomas see me a bit on edge, but that was shortly before Annette left. Other than that, they were very nice, and talked to everyone rather than ignoring them. My only real complaint is that the signed poster was small and looked like it had been thrown together last minute. I feel that's the fault of the venue, not the band. 
p2939
aVI think Tuomas seems like the type of person who wouldn't be a big fan of mass meet-and-greets with people who love him but have never met him...I know I would be &gt;.&lt;\u000a\u000aSounds good though, I don't care much for the poster/program thing, the meet-and-greet is where the fun would be for me.
p2940
aVYeah. He isn't really much of a people person. Jukka was very outgoing, he had a small conversation with my girlfriend about her shirt, and I shook Marcos hand. \u000aAll I really care about the poster is that I have Annette's autograph along with everyone's. \u000aDefinitely go for it though. Its expensive, but worth it. 
p2941
aVI don't know much about Jukka or Emppu, but I wouldn't have thought that Jukka would be really outgoing - guess everyone can surprise you :)\u000a\u000aI'll heavily consider it in the next day or two, sounds like a lot of fun if they keep doing what they did when you went.
p2942
aVEither way, it will be a great concert. I noticed in a previous comment that you'll be going to the Palladium. It's a really great venue, for the main stage. A bit of advice for the future thiugh, make sure any concert you're going to is held in the main room. The upstairs room is way too small for some of the shows they hold there. Enjoy the concert though. I have high hopes for this tour. 
p2943
aVKind of seconding what everyone else has said - the times I've seen Nightwish were the best concerts of my life. They put on an amazing show and you can't beat Floor for live vocals.\u000a\u000aFrom what I've heard about the VIP it doesn't sound worth the money. I like to get signatures but it's never that great getting 2 seconds with a band sat at a table. I was amazingly lucky and got to meet them with the fan club when they were really chilled and could talk to people - maybe you could join the US fan club just in case they have an opportunity like that?\u000a\u000aEpica's VIP sounded a lot better since it was only £30 and you got a bunch of free stuff and a photo with the band, but we got stuck in traffic and missed it! :'( so if you do get VIP, make sure you get there really early...
p2944
aVAs it stands now after seeing the comments here, I believe I'm going to take the chance and hope that the VIP is more than just a few seconds with them (I'm likely going to have my parents cover half the price of the VIP ticket as a birthday gift since it's a week or two away from my birthday).\u000a\u000aWorst case scenario (meet and greet not being too special), I still get to see them up close, and get to see the show regardless, and look into it for the next tour. Best case scenario, I don't even have to worry :D\u000a
p2945
aVIt's just a meet and greet. Shake hands, take photo, get something signed and then stay in the first row (which is how it used to be handled and the actual reason people buy VIP).
p2946
aVGoing off of past experiences of VIP shows, this one seems to be standard. Being EntertheVault.com, they usually give a tour poster, early access to meet the band, take a photo with them and allow you to interact/have them sign your merch (including the poster you just got) Depending on how many people are going VIP, this will determine if it's a quick 30-60 seconds with the band, or 5-10 minutes. Seeing how Nightwish is not a band that does this often, I see the former.\u000a\u000aTour program sounds like it's a tour only piece of merch that has tour dates and other little tidbits of info/pictures others won't be able to get.\u000a\u000aAlthough $180 for VIP? That's going too far (price wise) IMO. I've seen Iced Earth 3 times VIP and I think it may be just over that price with all of them put together. But if you're a diehard fan, power to you.
p2947
aVMain reason I question doing it is, as said in a few other comments, I'll have most of the ticket price covered by my parents basically as my birthday gift for the year - even then it's still kinda pushy, but I understand (to a certain extent) why it'd be a bit more pricey than others, since they're a huge musical entity worldwide.
p2948
aVI've seen them live 7 times in 3 countries and I'm flying over to the U.S. For the start of the tour in April. They are incredible live. The VIP ticket price for the U.S. Is a money making exercise by the promoter pure and simple. It's daylight robbery

aVNice! Yeah I didn't really have the money for the bundle so I figured I'd just get the earbook and then can buy some of the other merch at a later date - hopefully when they go on tour; last time I saw them was quite late on the DYU tour and they still had all the merchandise for sale.
p2957
aVI ended up ordering [this](http://www.indiemerch.com/epica/item/25732) one. Expensive, but they're my favorite band and I reaaalllly like that flag it comes with. Plus with 3 shirts, the Earbook edition album, lanyard, and picks, I figure you get a decent amount of stuff.

p2977
aVYeah, I wasn't really impressed with the title. I would've preferred it be "Journey of Grandeur" like it was speculated. Nevertheless, I'm extremely excited about the release. 
p2978
aVI don't understand. Does this mean that certain editions will have songs that we won't see on other editions? I usually just buy their music from iTunes and am afraid I may miss some songs :(. 
p2979
aVWell, the 2CD edition comes with an instrumental CD (which I assume is the whole album in instrumental), while the 3CD edition comes with both instrumental and orchestral CDs. Those might get put up on iTunes, but it's hard to say without any confirmation.\u000a\u000aOther than that, we don't know yet - no tracklists have been revealed! But sometimes bands have different bonus tracks that are exclusive to certain editions (Epica do that a lot - there were several of their songs I missed because they were iTunes exclusive or North American exclusive etc). Nightwish usually only do a couple of bonus tracks though, so they'll probably be easy to get hold of.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p2980
aVAh okay thank you!  Yes it really frustrates me that Epica did that. I would pay for all of those bonus tracks if I could buy them somewhere! I guess I'll wait and see what Nightwish does. 
p2981
aV&gt; it really frustrates me that Epica did that\u000a\u000aI'm pretty sure it's Nuclear Blast's fault for putting different bonus tracks on certain editions; I don't think the members of Epica planned it that way, but I could be wrong. After all, it's the labels that own rights to the music, unfortunately.

aVBeen meaning to get into Blind Guardian for a very long time now...where should I start? I'm familiar with 3 songs by them (Otherland, Turn the Page, and The Bard's Song) and from first impressions, the vocalist sounds like one of the best Power Metal vocalists I've heard in a long time...very powerful voice.
p3018
aVI'd reckon Nightfall in Middle Earth is a great first album to listen to, in order to get a very comprehensive picture of both their musical and lyrical styles and themes. 
p3019
aVBlind Guardian has been one of my absolute favorite bands for 15 years.  Everything's good, but particularly anything from Imaginations from the Other Side and after is especially good.  Imaginations is where I started (I saw "Bright Eyes" on tv when music videos were still played).  Nightfall in Middle Earth is a concept album about The Silmarillion, if you're into Tolkien at all.  A Night at the Opera has "And Then There Was Silence" which is incredible (and as a teenager, I listened to that entire album for like 2 years straight).  Personally I wasn't crazy about A Twist in the Myth overall, but the album after that, At the Edge of Time, I think is very solid.  I particularly enjoy "Sacred Worlds," "Curse My Name," and "Wheel of Time."  \u000a\u000a\u000aEdit:  after reading my comment and another person's reply, it seems you should start with their entire catalog.  
p3020
aVBoth *Sacred Worlds* and *Wheel of Time* are among my all time favourite songs. For those two alone I'd say that *At the Edge of Time* is Blind Guardian's best work.
p3021
aVSacred Worlds. For me, that was the song that completely hooked me on them. It is epic and huge and gorgeous.
p3022
aVImaginations From The Other Side is their most loved work amongst the fans, generally. I'd tell you to go for Nightfall In Middle Earth and Somewhere Far Beyond myself, maybe with some Follow The Blind for the older speed metal sound thrown in for good measure. \u000a\u000aAfter that, hen maybe try their newer stuff, the divisive but gloriously over the top A Night At The Opera, and the stunning latest release At The Edge Of Time. 
p3023
aVBathory reference?
p3024
aVJust a very common reference to Norse myth. 'Twilight of the gods' is a translation of 'Ragnarøkkr.'
p3025
aVI always think things are a reference. A brewery near me had a porter named Nightside Eclipse, and I'm still convinced it was named after the Emperor album.
p3026
aVI saw them live at House of Blues in Orlando, Florida years ago.  They played 3 songs and were like "Thank you very much and goodnight".  People wouldn't stop cheering, and then they came back on and played a 15 song encore.

VCurious for the results! 
p3032
aVThis is not for a project or anything, just out of my own curiosity. I'll post the results a couple of weeks from now. Hopefully there will be many responses.\u000a\u000aIf this is a success we can do another survey next year or something. I didn't want to make this one too long, but there are other questions I'd like to ask. (For example, I strongly suspect there is a correlation between liking symphonic metal and fantasy literature.)
p3033
aVI'm most curious about the "other genres" question. How many people who listen to symphonic metal also listen to other metal vs how many listen to "regular" symphonic/orchestral music.
p3034
aVI'm also really interested about this. I generally listen to only very heavily melodic music, and I jumped to symphonic metal and orchestral music from New Age music, of all things, stuff like Enigma. Would be interesting to know if anyone else had a similar experience.
p3035
aVI'm somewhat similar: I mostly listen to Chill Electronica, New Age and Synth-pop. I've always listened to a little bit of Metal, but never very much; I've liked Nightwish and known that Symphonic Metal was a thing for a few years now, but never really got into it until I stumbled onto this subreddit by accident a few months ago. I was in the middle of a massive Enya kick, so it was a nice change of pace. I ended up sticking around and have grown quite fond of the genre.
p3036
aV&gt;I jumped to symphonic metal and orchestral music from New Age music, of all things,\u000a\u000aI actually went the opposite way.  Stumbled into symphonic metal years ago, eventually found that New Age-y stuff too.  I'm more into the harmonics, but the more melodic tracks get me going too
p3037

aVI dunno man, a death meal sounds kinda bad for you.

p3040
aVI mostly listen to forms of more melodic metal, like power (which admittedly has some overlap with symphonic), folk, melodeath etc. But for some reason, when i listen to electronic it's usually the heavy stuff, like raw hardstyle, neurofunk etc.
p3041

aVI don't want to influence the results by sharing anything before I close it down, you'll find out soon :-)
p3045
aVAh, yes, sorry! Hope you get lots of participants. I really have a thing for survey data.
p3046
aVAlright, I have to ask...  Does anyone *actually* believe Evanescence is symphonic metal?
p3047
aVI never really know how I feel about Evanescence. They're the main reason I first listened to any actual symphonic metal because I adored the end of "Whisper", so I feel like I need to give them some kind of credit.
p3048
aVI would argue for a few of their songs, but I think on the whole, they are symphonic *rock*. Maybe even symphonic pop-rock. 
p3049
aV[deleted]
p3050
aVI run a symphonic metal club on DeviantArt as well, and we used to get tons of Evanescence submissions. We ended up having to make a "Similar Bands" category to put them all in. So I guess a lot of people do think they're in this genre. \u000a\u000aI quite like them, but I think of them as more of a rock band. Even Wikipedia can't decide what to label them: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescence#Musical_style

They have been compared to a variety of bands from differing genres, such as [nu metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal)  ensembles like [P.O.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.O.D.) and [Linkin Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park),   gothic metal groups like [Lacuna Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacuna_Coil),  and [symphonic metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_metal) acts like [Nightwish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwish) and [Within Temptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Within_Temptation).  David Browne of *Blender* offers an elaborate description of the band's music as "goth Christian nü-metal with a twist of melancholic Enya."  Adrien Begrand of Popmatters describes Evanescence as utilising "nu-metal riffage".  [Adrian Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Jackson_(musician\u005c)) of [My Dying Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Dying_Bride) stated that he feels Evanescence is doing something similar to his own gothic metal group, only in a more commercial direction.  Other genres and influences used to describe the band's sound include [industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music),   [alternative metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_metal),  [progressive metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal),  [alternative rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock),  [hard rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock),  [electronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronica),  [post-grunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-grunge),  [chamber pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_pop),  and [heavy metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music).  The band's official website classed their musical genre simply as "rock".\u000a\u000a&gt;Evanescence was originally promoted in Christian stores. Later, the band made it clear they did not want to be considered part of the [Christian rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_rock) genre, like fellow Wind-up Records artists [Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_(band\u005c)).  Terry Hemmings, CEO of Christian music distributor Provident, expressed puzzlement at the band's about-face, saying, "They clearly understood the album would be sold in these [Christian music] channels."  After many Christian stores began to remove the band's music from their shelves, Wind-up Records chairman Alan Meltzer then issued a press release in April 2003 requesting formally that they do this.  In 2006, Amy Lee told *Billboard* that she had opposed being identified as a "Christian band" from the beginning. \u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a^Interesting: [^Evanescence ^\u005c(Evanescence ^album)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescence_\u005c(Evanescence_album\u005c)) ^| [^Evanescence ^discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescence_discography) ^| [^Evanescence ^\u005c(Scorn ^album)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescence_\u005c(Scorn_album\u005c)) ^| [^Evanescence ^\u005c(Maria ^Schneider ^album)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescence_\u005c(Maria_Schneider_album\u005c)) \u000a\u000a^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+clup3im) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+clup3im)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

p3053
aVAmerican symphonic metal. It's not like your usual nordic metal, but it's still symphonic metal

p3079
(lp3080
VThis is brilliant - so interesting and the data is well-presented and easy to read (I just read it all on mobile with no problems).\u000a\u000aI think the demographic of the sub is the biggest surprise for me. I would have thought there would be more women (especially given the amount of times people have made comments to me about symphonic metal being 'girly'), and more people from Europe (where the genre is most popular). But if you'd asked me about the demographic of Reddit as a whole I probably would have guessed that there's a lot of male Americans, so perhaps it's not so surprising after all. \u000a\u000aIt was interesting as well to see that the answers I picked were invariably the most popular ones. I'm obviously just too mainstream... 
p3081
aVThis was a lot of work, but definitely worth doing. Please post if you have any questions or suggestions!
p3082
aVI thought it was interesting that despite only being a part of Nightwish so far for live shows, and the album yet to be released, Floor is nearly as popular as Tarja already.
p3083
aVYeah, unless the upcoming studio album with Floor is terrible I expect her to be the favourite Nightwish vocalist within the year. I also found it very interesting that Anette is ranked below Marco.
p3084
aVThe results are pretty much in line with what I expected, although with even fewer Europeans and way more Nightwish fans than I had thought. It kinda saddens me as a big Therion fan to see them so far down these lists (and I was apparently the only person who said Sirius B was their favourite album). On the other hand, it's nice to see symphonic black metal finally getting some love. Also, someone put E Nomine as their favourite symphonic metal band, which is something I never would have expected.
p3085
aVYeah, Therion is really underappreciated on this sub. I like how it got only 11 people voting and yet 6 different picks overall in the favourite album category. I also agree with you that Sirius B is consistently overlooked by people, in fact even by most Therion fans - ok, perhaps it's not *as good as* Secret of the Runes, but in my opinion it still belongs to the top three (together with Theli). \u000a\u000aWhere do you see the love for symphonic black though? I lost all my hope after reading that I was seemingly the only one to vote for Vortex as their favourite vocalist. I get it that most people prefer female singers, but... losing to Anette Olzon? That hurts. Maybe next year there should be separate categories for female and male vocalists.  
p3086
aVChoosing the best Therion album to list as my favourite was really difficult because they've released so many top notch albums over the years. I think part of the reason they're not very popular here is because their best albums are all old - older than Reddit. Plus, they don't have the same "epic metal" feel that attracts a lot of people to symphonic metal in the first place, especially to Epica, Blind Guardian and Nightwish.\u000a\u000aWhat I meant about the symphonic black metal scene getting some love is that it's the first time I've seen a black metal band be mentioned here, as the scene usually gets ignored. There were a few mentions of Dimmu Borgir and Abrahadabra in the survey responses, so there are at least a few fans of the genre on here.
p3087
aVwhat are some good songs from "E Nomine?"
p3088
aVIt depends what you're looking for (it's worth noting that they were an electronic group, not metal). The extended version of [Schwarze Sonne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTimWOT5bA) is one of my favourite songs by any band. Mitternacht, Vater Unser, Die Runen von Asgard and Der Furst Der Finsternis are good examples of their more upbeat style, while Psalm 23, Die Sintflut, Das Rad Des Schicksals are calmer and more emotional. Angst, Zorn, Der Ring Des Niebelungen and Ave Maria are all worth listening to as well.
p3089
aVI love [Morgane Le Fay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aLYB37YzYs).
p3090
aVWhat is the must have Therion album? I've been meaning to listen to them for ages but never got to it. I'll check em out. 
p3091
aVTheir most important album stylistically is *Theli*, from all the way back in 1996. *Theli* is arguably the first truly symphonic metal album. It contains Therion's amazing signature song *To Mega Therion*.\u000a\u000aTheir best album is either *Secret of the Runes* or *Sirius B*. \u000a\u000aTheir best live album is *Live Gothic*, the video of which is really worth watching. 
p3092
aVTheli marks the beginning of Therion's distinct style of symphonic metal and is definitely worth listening to. Lemuria/Sirius B and Secret of the Runes are also fan favourites, and all three are worth listening to. Secret of the Runes was the first Therion album I listened to, so I'd start there or with Theli.
p3093
aVcan't believe kamelot's "momento mori" wasn't a top song though...
p3094
aVIf I could have listed two songs it would have made my list, but I was only allowed one.
p3095
aVI wonder if the popularity of Tarja was because many of us discovered Nightwish with Tarja as the lead vocalist and grew attached to her voice?\u000a\u000aThat was certainly the case with me, I never did care for Anette's style (not as operatic), though I don't mind the songs with her singing, I just prefer Tarja.  Certainly looking forward to seeing how Floor Jansen will be.
p3096
aVi liked nightwish and got into them because they were something new and their songs were interesting, tbh i did NOT prefer tarja's vocals
p3097
aVThat's how I feel as well. Though for me, Tarja was the better fit than Anette but IMO she wasn't very good. Even with studio work, it still seemed like Tarja struggled to keep it on key sometimes (I could never listen to Tarja sing live, it was just bad), and it never sounded like she sang with much energy.\u000a\u000aFloor is very energetic and does very well live, which is a great sign for when they go into the studio IMO.\u000a\u000aI guess what I'm saying is that Floor is my favorite because she has the right sound like Tarja, but can back it up with energy and proficiency.
p3098
aVI totally agree. Tara was certainly unique and it helped make Nightwish stand out, but honestly she wasn't that good. If it wasn't for Toumas' music backing her, I doubt anyone would know who she is. Compare her to really good operatic vocalists like Sarah Brightnan and she is just not in that class. And watching her on stage was cringe worthy. She danced around like an old woman. :p Her showmanship was also bad.\u000a\u000aI'm not trying to shit on Tarja, i just don't really care for her. And yes she was certainly a better fit than Anette who was even worse live. I still liked Anette on the albums though.\u000a\u000aBut thank god for Floor. They finally have the vocalist they deserve. Already have my VIp tickets for May. :)
p3099
aVI love to see these comments! \u000a\u000aPersonally, I liked Annette a bit more than Tarja, mainly because she fit the direction Nightwish was headed in much better. The early albums with Tarja sounded great, but by the time we got around to Once, her voice just sounded wooden. Regardless of what her supporters brag, I doubt any of them would claim that Tarja can pull off a song like Meadows of Heaven. \u000a\u000aI feel like the best vocalists are either excellent at one style of vocal or else they can cover lots of territory. Tarja was a mediocre opera vocalist who stood out in a time when there weren't many opera vocalists in symphonic metal. Nowadays, you can listen to a band like Liv Moon and Tarja seems laughable in comparison. But Floor, on the other hand, can cover a wide range of styles, so even if she isn't a world class opera singer, she still is pretty much ideally suited for the genre. 
p3100
aV100% agreed. Tarja was good enough for her time, but she can't cut the mustard today. Even Xandria's new singer wipes the floor with her, especially live. Saw them live and my jaw dropped at how amazing the entire band was live after they opened with Nigthfall. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p3101
aVThe first gilding this sub has seen. Congrats!
p3102
aVIt's a first for me too, really awesome! 
p3103
aVWow, I totally missed the (probably old) news of Floor joining Nightwish!  That's awesome!  I stopped paying attention to Nightwish after Annette joined, I just wasn't a fan of her style.  But I really enjoyed After Forever back in the day and am excited to hear Floor again!  
p3104
aVYou should look up some live videos with Floor. I find that she fits in with the band much better than Annette did, both with her voice and her personality.
p3105
aV[You're welcome!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA)
p3106
aVJust a thought, in the future you should require people to answer every question so that you don't add even more selection bias than is already there. :)
p3107
aVI don't like this idea. You'd have to be asking perfect questions.
p3108
aVNo, the thought is that small errors will be smoothed out as your sample size gets larger. 
p3109
aVIf you have to answer every question that would create a stronger correlation between each question.\u000a\u000aIf you don't have to answer every question it would simply be a collection of one question surveys. There would be no actual 'error'. You just can't create as strong a correlation between each question. However, as the sample size increases the correlation strength increases.\u000a\u000aUnless you have perfectly worded questions, creating a requirement to answer every question would then present an actual error. For example, when I was taking this survey and I was asked "Where are you from?" I am conflicted because I live in america, but I wasn't born in america. I also have dual citizenship. I simply did not answer that question. I could have put down america, but that wouldn't be entirely true which creates a little bit of actual error because x% of the answers to the questions won't be entirely true. 
p3110
aVThe thing is, if 95% of people know where they come from there's minimal error in the survey. The problem I'm pointing out is that if you allow people to skip questions you have selection bias. What it people from America really like to tell people that they're from America, but people from Sweden are very private and don't like to share? then you ahve a significant bias in your survey, which is more problematic than the small % of people that don't know the answer to the question. \u000a\u000aFurther, even just putting an 'I don't know' option would probably lessen the bias a little bit (while requiring people to answer).
p3111
aVYes, but because you treat each question as a separate survey that bias doesn't matter. \u000a\u000aAssume all people from Sweden are shy and don't answer the question "where are you from". If I take a one question survey of /r/symphonicmetal and ask them where they're from i'm not gonna get anyone telling me they're from Sweden. I could repeat this and the same results would appear.\u000a\u000aFurthermore If I didn't want to tell you where I was from, or I didn't have a correct option. I might just not take the survey all together. I often do that with surveys that ask me "where are you from" or questions that ask if i'm "black/african american" without having an option for "other" because they're just too ambiguous. People don't like it when you represent everyone else, but not represent them so they just won't take your survey. People want to feel in control when they're taking surveys they don't have to be.\u000a\u000aIf you choose to require every answer filled you have to carefully word your questions so that you're able to represent as many people as possible. Having an "other" option is a bit ambiguous. If you want to make a quick survey, like this one, whose participants don't number in the thousands it shouldn't require every answer filled.
p3112
aVGreat job and thank you for the work. Really interesting and fun to see the results.
p3113
aVWell, I'm the one Uruguayan E Nomine fan lol. I've never been able to find myself in survey results before! Lol
p3114
aVVery interesting survey. I'm one of the six older than 46 who voted. I like so much music it gets hard to keep track of everything. I'm still discovering older bands let alone new ones to listen to. I like music from Jazz to classical to disco to metal. Seems I choose a lot of the popular answers which is fine, I don't mind being mainstream. haha.
p3115
aVI said that I count Evanescence as symphonic metal and I'm really surprised most people disagree. That said, I only have The Open Door and Fallen. Fallen especially had the occasional strings and choir but I haven't heard much of their later stuff.\u000a\u000aKingdom of Heaven needs more love! I reckon if it wasn't competing with Ghost Love Score and The Poet and the Pendulum it would have scored higher. All those songs are almost certainly in a top 5 for me. \u000a\u000aThe results are pretty much what I expected, though I assumed there was a massive majority of Europeans but apparently not. \u000a\u000aGreat survey! Good job and thanks for doing all the hard work! :D\u000a 
p3116
aV*looks at it* yes yes this seems about right
p3117
aVThanks for posting mate, a great survey and obviously a lot of work on your part. Glad I saw it in the feed, I may have forgotten otherwise!
p3118
aVNice job... I wonder who the one other person who picked Epica's Requiem for the Indifferent as favorite album was? 
p3119
aVHaha yay Versailles made it on one of the list period thats amazing to me.
p3120
aVAt least I wasn't the only guy from Portugal to use the survey hehe. Im happy for Floor Jansen being #1. I dont listen to Nightwish nor Epica though. I voted for Therion - Secret of The Runes for best album.\u000a
p3121
aVApparently there are less symphonic metal fans from Malaysia frequenting this subreddit compared to Singapore, which is amusing.\u000a\u000aSo who are the other Malaysians?
p3122
aVThanks for doing this, man. Great survey and fun to see the results.
p3123
aVI think the biggest surprise (for me) is the love people have for Nightwish's Ghost Love Score. I didn't think it was that popular, for I find it to be a farely boring tune. But again, that's personal opinion.\u000a\u000aExcellent data collected nonetheless.
p3124
aVI expect that's down to [Floor's Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V_eoR6r1Tw) of it. Definitely my favourite version of any song ever.
p3125
aVI was unaware that she sang it. Granted, live stuff usually flies under the radar for me unless it's something special, much like Epica's Classical Conspiracy album.
p3126
aVFloor live is always something special. 
p3127
aVIt's a perennial favourite. I've done my own polls where I've pre-emptively removed it from the list because it always wins! I've always liked it but, as others have said, it was Floor's version of it that boosted it to being my top song.
p3128
aVSeeing all the love for Floor I expected After forever to be higher up there. Maybe if they were still around.
p3129
aVYeah me too. Even apart from launching Floor's career in metal, After Forever also gave birth to Epica (by firing Mark Jansen but also enabling him to meet Simone Simons) and several other band members have gone on to do so much more in symphonic metal. After Forever played a significant part in the history of the genre!

aVI would love to hear a collaboration between Orphaned Land and Nightwish. They really have a similar band dynamic in many ways. 
p3169

aVNot gonna lie, hearing Floor or Simone sing "I Kissed a Girl" would be kinda weird but I'd totally listen to it.  \u000a\u000aCome to think of it, I'd like to hear "Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift sung by Floor. That would be interesting.

(lp3248
VI'm incredibly amused that this was my guess in the Tuomas chatroom when he said it was someone who wasn't a musician. To be fair though, the band did keep wearing Dawkins t-shirts, which was a bit of a giveaway. \u000a\u000aI do wonder if they're basing the album or a song on *The Magic of Reality* then, since Tuomas has said he loves that book. Which could mean a possible Dave McKean collaboration (he illustrated the book). I'm kicking myself for not having asked Dave at a signing the other week, but then if he isn't involved he'd probably wonder what the hell I was on about.
p3249
aVThematically speaking, such a concept would move Nightwish closer to "Epica's" realm of song topics. Should be interesting to compare!
p3250
aVI doubt that his contribution will be a criticism of religion though, as Epica's would write. That just doesn't seem to fit Nightwish. I'm betting Dawkins' text will be something about the beauty of science or the amazing power of the scientific method.

(lp3310
VI was in that crowd, me and my buddies drove from Alberta to see them and Kamelot and got to witness some Nightwish history. We only discovered the change in vocalists about 30 minutes before the show but were impressed by show's end! I wanna see them now that Floor is a proper fixture of the band. She apparently knew the songs but only had that day to prepare for a live show with Nightwish so in that case she did phenomenal!
p3311
aVWow, I had no idea she was so tall. Or maybe they're just short. She's 6'1".\u000a\u000aNot the best choice for a first official video with the new singer, IMO. With it being live and a song that doesn't showcase her voice that much it just didn't really do much to show what the new Nightwish is going to be like. They'd have been better off picking a song with a stronger female lead part, or maybe even waiting for Floor's first album as they did with Anette.
p3312
aVThis isn't the first official video with her. They have released three other live performances with her. One of them being Ghost Love Score that showcased her voice. And they have a full show DVD with her her

p3323
aVThe next step is to bracket the different versions of Ghost Love Score.  Either of Floor's wins, hands down.
p3324
aVYeah, that's what I'm expecting too, but I've already kind of been surprised at some of the results of the other brackets. 
p3325
aVJust coming back to this zombie post to let folks know... GLS is actually looking like it's going to be eliminated this round. To storytime! The shock and horror.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/nightwish/comments/2x3i8m/vote_for_your_favourite_nightwish_song_bracket_55/
p3326
aVYeah I think it's a mixture of people thinking GLS is overrated and people just expecting it to win so they chose storytime. I don't really care one way or the other. GLS is, in my opinion, their best song and it will probably always be that way.

p3331
aVFor those saying GLS will win - it will, but keep an eye on the whole tournament! The interesting results are what happens within each bracket.
p3332
aVI dunno, I actually prefer The Poet and the Pendulum as their best song. GLS comes in a very close second place.\u000a\u000aCould be partially due to overplaying GLS (yes, it can happen to the best of songs...) but I put it more towards the songwritring. If you assume both songs are Tuomas speaking of Tarja, then Penulum is, to me, kind of a "part 2" to GLS. The analysis spirals from there, and I just view Pendulum as, personally, a better song.
p3333
aVTPATP was my absolute favourite for a little while. It was only Floor's version of GLS that returned it to the top of my list. Her interpretation is just so good.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure about the meanings, though. I mean, no-one knows for certain if GLS is about a specific person (even Floor said she has no idea what it's about). And TPATP is really centered on Tuomas and his thoughts of depression and suicide - though I guess it was the turmoil in the band that caused that.
p3334
aVI've always viewed the entire album Once (GLS in particular) Tuomas's expression of frustration in one way or another. GLS being his declaration of giving up and wanting to get out of the situation with Tarja. And I've always seen TPATP as his apology to Tarja, notably because of the very last 4 lines.\u000a\u000aI could literally spent close to the reddit maximum length of a comment explaining why I believe this to be true, but obviously it's open to anyone's interpretations. To assume all he wrote about was love and complaints about love for 5+ years nonstop is a stretch, even I admit.
p3335
aVHaha, yeah, it's true that people will always interpret in different ways though! For me I've always believed that the end of the song is Tuomas's parents speaking to him, since the section's called Mother and Father and it opens with "be still my son, you're home".

p3368
(lp3369
VEach one of their albums is pretty different, so they'll appeal differently to everyone. I think the four latest albums are all simply great no matter what though.\u000a\u000aMy rating would be:\u000a\u000a1. Dark Passion Play\u000a2. Imaginaerum\u000a3. Century Child\u000a4. Once\u000a5. Wishmaster\u000a6. Oceanborn\u000a7. Angels Fall First.\u000a\u000aYou mentioned 4 songs as their most popular, and three are from a single album, Once. Might be that one album is not perfect for your tastes. Try *The Poet and the Pendulum* and *Last of the Wilds* from Dark Passion Play, *Ghost River* from Imaginaerum, *End of All Hope* and *Ocean Soul* from Century Child. But I'd recommend listening to the albums as a whole, especially Century Child and Imaginaerum, they come pretty close to concept albums, and listening to just individual songs will not do the albums justice.
p3370
aVI think it's unlikely that we'll all agree, haha. Given the songs you've said that you like, I would recommend listening in reverse chronological order, i.e Imaginaerum -&gt; DPP -&gt; Once and so on. I would definitely recommend watching the Showtime, Storytime DVD as well, since you're a fan of Floor. Her performance is wonderful.\u000a\u000aHere's my personal ranking, although I change my mind a lot, especially about the first 3. They're all pretty perfect to my mind.\u000a\u000a1. Once \u000a2. Imaginaerum \u000a3. Dark Passion Play \u000a4. Wishmaster \u000a5. Century Child \u000a6. Oceanborn \u000a7. Angels Fall First 
p3371
aV"I would definitely recommend watching the Showtime, Storytime DVD as well, since you're a fan of Floor. Her performance is wonderful."\u000a\u000aThis. Floor does an amazing job on Showtime, Storytime.
p3372
aV&gt; This. Floor does an amazing job on Showtime, Storytime.\u000a\u000aIn person she was fucking awesome, and it was only her 3rd or so show when I saw her.  I actually coughed up the money for the most expensive concert tickets I've ever bought--VIP for their tour next May.  (I saw them with Annette 3-4 times, and sadly never saw them with Tarja in person.)
p3373
aVNW have had a bit of a stylistic change over the years. The first three albums or so are symphonic power metal, meaning they were blistering fast, melodic, and catchy. Ever since *Century Child* though, they've gone more towards a plain symphonic metal sound, basically meaning they've slowed their music down a bit and they've turned up the symphonic parts. You really can't get a better idea of what NW's sound is nowadays that by listening to *Imaginaerum* and *Dark Passion Play*. But coming from a power metal fan, I find that some of the material from *Wishmaster* and *Oceanborn* is miles better than what they did with Anette. I'll include my favorite song from each album (that you may not have heard) as an indicator as to the overall sound of the album.\u000a\u000aMy Ranking:\u000a\u000a1. [*Wishmaster*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t8MbnWGcWc)\u000a\u000a2. [*Oceanborn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7Oj3tyyTxQ)\u000a\u000a3. [*Once*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52LpN5aIb3U)\u000a\u000a4. [*Imaginaerum*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukDEYRXoH2g)\u000a\u000a5.

[*Angels Fall First*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVAOXgNoX-8)
p3374
aVHey, I just recently got into this genre, and your post makes me think we have very similar tastes (My opinion is almost identical)\u000a\u000aCan you recommend me any other symphonic power metal bands?
p3375
aVSure thing.\u000a\u000a* [Epica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy5XTIFcKU8) - They use both harsh male vocals and operatic female vocals. They're often one of the first bands people check out after Nightwish due to the similar sound.\u000a\u000a* [Xandria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTAmmTiD_Y) - Probably the closest thing to NW's power metal era. Fast, bombastic, and energetic are all good ways to describe their music. \u000a\u000a* [Diabulus in Musica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzPESD5GGig) - Similar in style to Epica, but I just thought their 2014 album, *Argia*, was really good, so I'm including them.\u000a\u000a* [Damnation Angels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmy0y8U7vjE) - I don't know if you wanted any male-fronted bands, but Damnation Angels' most recent album is absolutely one I'd recommend you listen to, especially if the fantasy, over-the-top bands like Rhapsody of Fire and Dragonland aren't to your liking.\u000a\u000a* [Ancient Bards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxnlx_TgRpI) - Pretty much a female-fronted version of [Rhapsody of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxGu5HjarmU).\u000a\u000a* [Serenity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_8XUhfnv2g) - Clean male and female vocals. They're very similar in style to [Kamelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7x5l2FK5N8), if you're familiar with them.
p3376
aVHm, I have enjoyed what I've heard from xandria and epica, I'll check out the others!
p3377
aVExcellent suggestions. I really love all of those bands.
p3378
aVNote on Xandria... only their latest two releases are like that. prior to that they are more like tristania/sirenia.
p3379
aVI had originally listened to a couple random Xandria songs back in the day of the India album (mostly Widescreen), but never paid much attention to them since.  I saw them doing all new material a month or two back and it was pretty good.  I just need to run through the last couple albums sometime and see if something really gets my attention.

aV[deleted]

aVI would recommend Delain as well, very good band
p3382
aVHeh, actually I rank them in reverse chronology, with the exception of Oceanborn and Wishmaster. So something like this:\u000a\u000a1. Imaginaerum\u000a2. Dark Passion Play\u000a3. Once\u000a4. Century Child\u000a5. Oceanborn\u000a6. Wishmaster\u000a7. Angels Fall First
p3383
aVI'm going to agree with you on this.  Tuomas' compositions just get better and better.  Hell, I think his solo album this year has been the best release of 2014 that I've purchased.

Angels Fall First\u000a\u000aI love all of Nightwish's albums, even Angels Fall First, but it is arguably the worst. Tuomas's vocals plus the worst lyrics, and the most cheaply put together.
p3389
aVOh god, I already see this thread escalating terribly.\u000a\u000aWhatever, my ranking would look somehow like this:\u000a\u000a* 1. Imaginaerum\u000a* 2. Century Child\u000a* 3. Dark Passion Play\u000a* 4. Wishmaster\u000a* 5. Once\u000a* 6. Angels fall first\u000a* 7. Oceanborn [no hate please]

aVIt's all subject to opinion, but for me:\u000a\u000a1. Century Child (top songs Slaying the Dreamer and Beauty of the Beast)\u000a2. Once (top songs Romanticide and Ghost Love Score)\u000a3. Dark Passion Play (top songs Poet and the Pendulum and Sahara)\u000a4. Imaginaerum (top songs Ghost River and I Want My Tears Back)\u000a5. Oceanborn (top songs Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean and The Pharaoh Sails to Orion)\u000a6. Angels Fall First (top songs Astral Romance and Angels Fall First)\u000a7. Wishmaster (no top songs, I'm least familiar with this album among them all)
p3392
aVI would say....\u000a\u000aDark Passion Play\u000a\u000aCentury Child\u000a\u000aOceanborn\u000a\u000aOnce\u000a\u000aImaginaerum\u000a\u000aWishmaster\u000a\u000aAngels Fall First\u000a\u000a\u000aHonestly though, a lot of these are interchangeable with the exception of AFF being my least favourite.
p3393
aVI think my order will surprise most.\u000a\u000a1. Oceanborn\u000a2. Century Child\u000a3. Dark Passion Play\u000a4. Wishmaster\u000a5. Once\u000a6. Angels Fall First\u000a7. Imaginaerum\u000a\u000aWith this order, it shows why I'm on the fence about a new album, and yes, that includes knowing Floor Jansen will be doing vocals.\u000a\u000aAlso note that slots 2 to 4 can change depending on how I feel, which way the wind blows, if Top Spin works, etc.
p3394
aVI didn't start listening to NW until Once.  Other than a couple random songs (like Wishmaster or their cover of Over the Hills and Far Away) I never could get into their older stuff.  So with that limit:\u000a\u000a1. Once\u000a2. Imaginaerum\u000a3. Dark Passion Play\u000a\u000aI will say that now that many of Floor's live performances have been released I have a hard time listening to the original album versions of any of those songs.  \u000a\u000aAnnette tried, but she just wasn't a good fit.  For DPP we had no other reference point for the sounds of those songs (can't really count Marco's demos), and she did them okay.  Watching her live in person doing older material though was cringe-worthy.  The fact that they completely re-wrote Nemo into their live 'acoustic' version just for her helps demonstrate that.  Floor gave DPP and Imaginaerum the performances they deserved from the beginning.\u000a\u000a\u000aEven for Tarja's stuff, I prefer Floor's versions, and I rarely want to listen to live recordings over studio recordings.  My only regret so far is that when I saw Floor live it was only her 3rd or so show and didn't have Ghost Love Score (my favorite) worked into it yet.  The releases of her performance of that blow away Tarja, at least in my opinion.\u000a\u000aI never got into After Forever much, just a couple random songs.  Nothing wrong with it, just most didn't really stand out to me enough to obsess over.

VI don't know why, but I think I like the Buenos Aires version better... I think the crowd made that one more, magical?
p3411
aVYeah, I prefer the Buenos Aires version too. She sings the ending differently there, and (I think anyway) that it's much better than the one she does in this video (and all the others too).
p3412
aVShe sings differently, in Buenos Aires for example she sings "My fall willl be for youuuuu" whereas in Wacken its "My falll will beeeee fooooooor you" and I really prefer the first version of it.\u000a\u000aBut the solo from Emppu in this video is just ... miles away from any other version of it \u005co/.
p3413
aVI think they both have their merits. The crowd are way more excited, loud and passionate in the Buenos Aires version - which is really just a cultural thing, I guess us Europeans are generally more reserved at concerts, even if we're having an amazing time (or they're like me who just cried for the whole of GLS... I've become one of *those* girls...). I also prefer the ending of the Buenos Aires one. I'm not sure if she deliberately sang it differently at Wacken or just got the timing a bit wrong. On the other hand, I think she sings the rest of the song better in the Wacken version. It would be nice to have the audio of both, but I'll be very happy to have this one anyway.

p3448
aVSee, I prefer this one (Wacken). It has a more satisfying build up to the finale.
p3449
aVI've heard the Wacken one too, the guitar solo is also better in the Wacken version. \u000a\u000aI just like the Buenos Aires one significantly better for multiple factors. One of them is just the crowd noises in the background, for instance. Another is just how Floor sang the very last bit of it. I'm not sure that was rehearsed, I think it just came out that way that day, and everyone was blown away. (I could be wrong about that) I remember tearing up a little bit the first time I heard it. That definitely did not get to me in the same way on the Wacken version. It was still good, probably better in most technical aspects, but one of the best things about the Buenos Aires one is that it was just very genuine. I could probably write a whole 5-page paper on this... I'll spare you :)

p3456
aVAh, I thought SF was the third one, but I could have just remembered that wrong.
p3457
aVThree is what was stuck in my head, but maybe I'm off by one.\u000a\u000a\u000aI got a chuckle out of Floor's 'setlist' they put up for her.  Instead of the usual simple set list (I actually have Emmpu's setlist from that show), hers was a full set of lyrics--a taped up grid of about 12 sheets of paper--completely covering the monitor and down onto the floor.\u000a\u000a\u000aUnlike the setlists, they did not hand that one out to the audience...rats.
p3458
aVNo Therion either ?\u000a\u000aLes Fleurs du Mal might be hard to like if you don't know the original songs (buf if you do, man these guys do great covers), but Sitra Athra was not so long ago !\u000a\u000aDon't know how old this sub is though, might be too "young" for the last great Therion albums :o
p3459
aVIt's a shame but not a surprise considering that their best albums are all 10+ years old, and their more recent releases have had mixed receptions from fans (although I really liked Gothic Kabbalah). They've also not had any news with regards to new material yet, plus they're not as commercially successful as Nightwish, Within Temptation and Epica.
p3460
aVYou're absolutely right, Therion's best stuff is much older than this subreddit. I didn't like *Gothic Kabbalah*, but I do think *Live Gothic* was amazing. Their best line-up so far.
p3461
aVThe sub is three years old :) there has been quite a lot of Therion posted, but they're not upvoted quite as much as the bands listed at the top.
p3462
aVOoh, interesting! Thanks for putting this together. I would've guessed Ghost Love Score as the favourite - I suppose having three entries, it probably is the most upvoted overall. I'm also surprised that the Buenos Aires one didn't make it in, as it's my favourite performance, and the crowd really add to the atmosphere in that one.\u000a\u000aIn general, I can see there's a preference for things that have been new singles/official videos since the subreddit's been going, which makes sense.
p3463
aVReally surprised Leaves Eyes isn't in the top 40 as well! Especially their last album, it had a couple of amazing songs that would fit right in.

asVLooking for a certain genre within this genre
p3466
(lp3467
VDo you just mean orchestral versions of symphonic metal songs? Sorry if I'm misinterpreting. You can get the orchestral versions of some of the Nightwish and Epica albums on special editions of the CDs - or if you can't get hold of those some of them are up on YouTube or Spotify.
p3468
aVYes, orchestral versions of symphonic metal band's songs. Preferably done by the original band, but if it sounds good I'll listen.
p3469
aVNightwish has released a purely orchestral version of Imaginaerum and has also released instrumentals (includes band) of the aforementioned album and DPP. Epica had also released instrumentals of their latest two albums, but no orchestrals. So, you might want to check those out. 
p3470
aVAha, there we go, I was being stupid and thinking that my 3cd edition of TQE was instrumental and orchestral but it's acoustic and instrumental, isn't it?\u000a\u000aNightwish created an orchestral CD for Once but it's very rare. However I believe you can hear it at least some of it on YouTube and the band did officially upload the orchestral Ghost Love Score.
p3471
aVI believe the earbook version of TQE contained a CD that was solely instrumental and another one that contained the acoustic songs and a bonus track. \u000a\u000aI've been trying to look for the orchestral version of Once for ages. All I've found were snippets of some of the songs on YouTube :/ 
p3472
aVI remember Tuomas's official site giving away the orchestral Once CD in a chat competition a while back. I was so sad that I didn't win! The person who did was lovely though, so that made me feel a little better.
p3473
aVYou should have gotten them to torrent it! 
p3474
aVHaha, I remember at the time plenty of people asked her to do that, but the admins pointed out that they would know exactly who leaked it and she'd be in big trouble.
p3475
aVDarn... That's cruddy... I like the orchestration in Dark Chest of Wonders especially near the end... not much flute in other bands like this. 
p3476
aVIf you don't mind other languages, Soner Canozer, who led the Turkish symphonic metal band Almora before it broke up, re-did many of that band's songs with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra in the album *Masalci'nin On Be\u015f Y\u0131l\u0131*, or Storyteller's 15 Years, referring to Canozer's time as a songwriter.\u000a\u000aHere's one of the songs, K\u0131yamet Senfonisi (Judgement Symphony): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a50K9_7LhI8 
p3477
aVAre these songs on Spotify? If so, what artist should I search for?
p3478
aVNo idea as to Spotify, but many of the songs are on Youtube (you may have to try different versions that'll work in your country). Search for the artist, Soner Canozer, and the album name I wrote above. You don't have to get the Turkish characters correct.\u000a\u000aHere's one Youtube guy who seems to have uploaded all the songs, though he didn't create a playlist so you'll have to go through one after another using the side suggestions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TtE5tYgR5A
p3479
aVIt is on Spotify, thanks. I'll give it a listen!
p3480
aVI will add that you might also want to look up "acoustic" versions of existing bands' songs. They don't use an orchestra, but the sound is very different from the regular versions. I particularly like Epica's [Natural Corruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEOmDUQaH5A), the acoustic version of which uses an accordion.

aVI've watched this dozens of times, and I always re-watch it whenever it's posted. This is easily my favorite recording of the song, live or not.
p3513
aVSuch a great gig. I can't WAIT until their new material is out. Floor managed to take songs that were (imo) dull and breathe some life into them, while at the same time absolutely nailed the older, more technically challenging ones.
p3514
aVI agree with you completely! The first time when I listened to Floor performing some of the old 'average' songs, it was like 'Wow! How come I have missed how great that song is.'  She fits Nightwish so well. I will see them performing live in August, I can hardly wait!! :-)
p3515
aVThere are a couple of not-so-popular songs that she has adopted and breathed new life into (She is my Sin, Romanticide for example) in a successful bid to establish herself as the new face of Nightwish. I'm sure this was by design, and well done. I too can't wait for the new album, and even more awesomely have tickets for their show in April right after the album comes out. :)
p3516
aVYou know what would be really cool? A rerecorded "best of"-type compilation of a whole bunch of tunes with Floor singing. I sure would love to see her take on, say, Sahara, or Bye Bye Beautiful.

aVIf people are able to, I really recommend buying the DVD of this. Or even just listening to the recordings, which I think are free on Spotify. It is so worth your time. I've lost count of how many times I've listened to it and I normally hate live CDs. Floor's interpretations are just so great.

p3529
(lp3530
VOohh, just three? Hard to say. The genre is diverse enough that I can't really think of what "representative" would mean for it. (One thing I love about it, let alone how diverse metal is overall) I'll try to give you some options with some explanation, and maybe you can use other responses and other sites to narrow down your choices.\u000a\u000aSo symphonic metal overall came from gothic metal roots, but elements of power, progressive, and death metal also played a part. [Therion's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvIW2dVv8GU) album Theli is considered one of the albums that pioneered the genre. [Nightwish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsV5sUuCn4M) and [Within Temptation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyuJI73Uxns) are probably the two biggest bands that you could consider as the first bands that truly began as symphonic metal, and popularized it, inspiring many new bands to join the genre. They have really great writing for their symphonic pats.\u000a\u000aFrom a historical perspective, I'd go with those three, but to musically explore the genre you need to consider more options. \u000a\u000a[Xandria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vLwWtSwNTI), with their latest album Neverworld's End, is very over-the-top symphonic metal, even though their earlier albums are more gothic. The orchestra part is extremely forceful and driving. [Leaves Eyes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ6He-9sLoY) is a fantastic example of the folk influence in the genre, although Nightwish has some of that. \u000a\u000a[Blind Guardian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ts8cPScXM), and [Wintersun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMbFu457jGs) are bands with male singers that I would say are better classified as symphonic metal than anything else, although Blind Guardian leans toward power and Wintersun toward death. Look at [Delain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkXhOhfh_f8) for an example of pop influence in the genre. Even more pop-y is [Amaranthe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHeMck0Ap3I) although they're not really symphonic. \u000a\u000aDo you want to consider bands that sing in other languages? [Eihwaz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkdHRNnb6g) or [Elis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY_NINTZXkg) are bands to look at. For even more variety, consider [Diablo Swing Orchestra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osTu38yuuHo), they're avant-garde metal but could be considered symphonic.\u000a\u000a[After Forever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdb7WsoRIo8) and [Epica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTuwlD6cSUw) both have gothic roots, but are still best classified as symphonic metal. Both have strong influences of progressive, power, and death. One thing I like about these bands is they don't neglect the guitars as much as other symphonic metal, which sadly sometimes suffers from boring riffs to let the choir and orchestra have more room. I'd say Epica is one of the leading symphonic metal bands post-2010. \u000a\u000aThere's so much more... I'd say since it sounds like you're a music major the best thing you can do is listen to all these examples, and much more. I don't really have music theory knowledge so I can't help you decide from that direction. If you're going for historical influence, look at the first three I mentioned. For being representative... this is tough... pick Epica since you can get everything from them (power linked above, [gothic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DwMJggG-vs), [progressive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nohoGUsr7R8), [death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKGxryyxeN8), great [ballads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALDD5XaQuw), etc.). Then probably Nightwish so you can have some classic symphonic metal that started early and is still going, also for their [folk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2sd8UMUaIk) stuff, although Leave's Eyes has a much stronger Scandinavian folk influence. Third choice, I don't know, whatever includes the most variety after your first two.
p3531
aVThanks so much for a really detailed reply, I'm sorry I've taken so long to respond but I wanted to listen to all the examples you linked - thanks so much for all of those. It's looking like my three bands are going to be Within Temptation, Nightwish and Epica just from the number of times they've been mentioned when I've asked this question in various forums and places. But I'll have to pick songs to analyse as well. I'd love to go into detail on a lot of the bands you and everyone else has mentioned but I'm not sure that's within the scope of my paper, but I appreciate having so many suggestions! Many thanks.
p3532
aVNightwish and Within Temptation would be my picks. Early and latter works respectively. 
p3533
aVThose two bands seem to be coming up the most, so I think I'll be using them for my analysis.
p3534
aVNightwish because of Tuomas' song writing, Epica because it shows a heavier side, and Kamelot because it shows that Symphonic Metal is also a man's game!
p3535
aVI have a friend I met through being a Nightwish fan who's really into Kamelot too. They're great to listen to.
p3536
aVIt seems like the most people are recommending Nightwish and Within Temptation. I agree with that, but I would like to suggest some albums to look at.\u000a\u000aFor Nightwish, you will be good with pretty much any album. Once, Dark Passion Play, and Imaginaerum use a full orchestra, whereas the previous albums are more keyboard driven. For Within Temptation, I would suggest the albums Mother Earth for more keyboard driven music, and The Silent Force and The Heart of Everything for the full orchestra. Their latest album is way more poppy and deviates so far from the symphonic standard that I don't consider it to really be in the genre.
p3537
aVIt's a bit tough too choose a Nightwish song to analyse for this project since I love so many of their songs, however I'm thinking of going with Ghost Love. I'm listening to those Within Temptation albums now and trying to decide which song to go with.
p3538
aVI completely agree with /u/Tremaparagon 's suggestion in that diversity should be important. There's little point in analyzing three bands that sound similar imo. \u000a\u000aFor example, you could talk about the different types of orchestrations there are. I mean each band has it's unique influences from different types of orchestral music. \u000a\u000aFor example a band such as Rhapsody have tons of influence from Baroque era and classical era music. Listen to [The Dark Tower of Abyss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRm2woctzo) or the interlude in [Warrior of Ice](http://youtu.be/ro-ACJ9vNEQ?t=4m14s). They also take music from some [medieval folk and classical music](http://youtu.be/mbyK65_bts4?t=4m6s)\u000a\u000aOn the more modern end of the spectrum, bands such as Nightwish take lots of influence from modern day orchestral film music. I don't know specifically but I've heard Tuomas has lots of influence from composers such as Hans Zimmer and I wouldn't be surprised of people such as John Williams or Danny Elfman were influences too. [Ghost Love Score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3yqMr3ffY) and [Imaginaerum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyxhuviI9Jk) are great examples \u000a\u000aThere are then gothic metal/symphonic metal bands, bands that make use of folk melodies and instrumentation and much more. Like mentioned, the orchestrations Diablo Swing Orchestra are in the context of a swing big band. Early symphonic black metal bands use more ambient keyboards. The piano solo in [Art of Life](http://youtu.be/0eqmkgSeYjI?t=15m4s) by X Japan is totally modern classical and is even minimalistic. Symphony X I find has lots of influence from romantic and modern era classical music (listen to keyboardist Michael Pinnella's solo album) such as in their epic [The Odyssey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaN3pwBsRf8). Another example of the romantic stuff is symphonic black metal band [Sigh](http://youtu.be/NfRGvrfdpds?t=2m53s). Even Fleshgod Apocalypse is classical/romantic ESPECIALLY with their piano player that contributes a lot to their sound. Couldn't find an example but one of their new songs [Elegy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKzmT-VhrnA) shows off their style well. \u000a\u000a**tl;dr** do three bands that take different influence from different types of orchestral/classical music rather than three bands that sound the same. \u000a\u000a
p3539
aVYes, great suggestions that are even more varied than the ones I posted. Also it is an interesting idea to look at these bands by type of orchestral influence rather than type of metal influence.  
p3540
aVNightwish do have a bit of a film music sound in some aspects but as a soundtrack fan I think they use the orchestra in a unique way that's quite different to film music.\u000a\u000aIt looks like Within Temptation, Nightwish and Epica are going to be the bands I analyse and the justification for that is going to be the number of times they've been mentioned in answer to my question in various places about which bands are the most representative of the symphonic metal genre. I'd like to go for variety too however there are so many bands that it would be hard to explain why I chose a particular one - easier to draw patterns from the most popular bands.
p3541
aVI would love to read some of your paper once it's complete if it's ok with you! \u000a\u000aI'm curious to know what Nightwish album(s) you're going to use because their music does have distinct 'eras'. 
p3542
aVWell my supervisor recommended analysing just one song by each band in detail, so I'm going to use Ghost Love Score for Nightwish as it's got a lot of great material in there to study - orchestral sections, film-music-inspired sound, and of course Tarja.
p3543
aVNightwish and Within Temptation are the 2 obvious choices, any of my other favourite bands would be too similar to those, so for the most diversity I'll suggest Stream of Passion as the 3rd, their style is quite a bit different, as are the orchestral parts they use, a lot of string quartet and more progressive style.
p3544
aVI'll probably use Nightwish and Within Temptation, but thanks for your suggestion!
p3545
aVTherion, Epica, and Delain, are my three bands picks.
p3546
aVThanks for the suggestions!
p3547
aVKamelot with Roy Khan.  I consider Tommy Karevik to make them a more progessive than symphonic metal band.\u000a\u000a
p3548
aVKamelot is a pretty enjoyable band to listen to.
p3549
aVI'm definitely saying Epica &amp; Nightwish. Within Temptation seems pretty popular but I don't listen to them enough to say something. (I should though).
p3550
aVIt looks like those three bands are going to be the ones I analyse a song of each. They've been mentioned a fair few times.
p3551
aVI'd like to see what you're going to write. Also need any recommendation for songs?
p3552
aVYeah, if I remember I'll try to show you the finished result when I'm done. I think I'll do Ghost Love Score for Nightwish but for the other two bands I'm not sure yet. But my supervisor recommended using two similar-length songs (~10min).
p3553
aVIf it's around 10min personally i'd recommend Design your Universe or Serenade of Self Destruction for Epica.\u000aId mostly go for serenade though since it may be more relevant.
p3554
aVBlind Guardian is probably the longest, oldest, and best known in the genre.
p3555
aVI would say Blind Guardian leaned a bit more towards Power Metal with some symphonic elements than actual Symphonic Metal. It was until the release of "At the Edge of Time" that the orchestra became extremely prevalent (Sacred Worlds and Wheel of Time), IMO. 
p3556
aVYes. they are clearly pioneers in the genre, and now full symphonic metal.

p3593
aVAccording to me, they should be considered to be a symphonic metal band after they published Beyond Sanctorum (1992) 
p3594
aVThey were the first band that began using operatic choirs and classical elements more blatantly than any other band had before. Perhaps that's the primary reason they're consider the first symphonic metal band, but there were other bands that had done this before: Waltari and bands like Emperor who used symphonic elements in their music.

aVAha! Yes, mine is 1 DVD and 1 CD. I don't think it's American but then to be honest I don't remember where I bought it. That must be why I don't have the bonus show.
p3696
aVI can confirm that this concert is on the 2-disc blu-ray (it's a DVD while the Black Symphony show is on Blu-ray - and it looks and sounds fantastic - i've already watched it three times) as I got that version as a christmas gift. And, it should be noted, that it works in all regions as far as I can tell, since it works on my US PS4.

aVI was at both shoes in Eindhoven and Rotterdam and the Eindhoven show was Definitely the better one. Black Symphony is better shot but for the fan experience, Eindhoven felt like the more authentic WT show.

asVLoving this album! | MaYaN - Redemption (Feat. Floor Jansen)
p3699
(lp3700
VI'm convinced that anything with Floor is good.
p3701
aVI've been waiting for this album for awhile now but I've been too busy to actually listen to it. I have one question: is Laura Macri more prevalent on this album than she was on the last, or is she just in a few songs? I know she does Insano and I love that song, but I hope she's on more songs.  
p3702
aVUnfortunately, she's not as prevalent. Asides from "Insano" she gets a few small parts here and there. I think Mark mentioned he wanted to focus more on the male vocals than rely on female vocals, which is why Floor also gets very small parts in the few songs that she sings in. 
p3703
aVYea I figured as much. How would you rate the album? Did you like it better than Quarterpast?
p3704
aVI'd honestly give it an 85/100. It's a great album that definitely surpasses  "Quarterpast" and even Epica's RFTI. In fact this album sounds more like a successor to \u201cDesign Your Universe\u201d but a bit heavier. 
p3705
aVAlbum's so much more dynamic than the last one. great energy!

aVI actually completely forgot that this album was coming out because I was distracted by Hydra. Thanks for reminding me!

asVNightwish - Song of Myself
p3708
(lp3709
VProbably the best song they've ever done.  
p3710
aVNot going to lie, when I first heard this song I was kinda disappointed. They'd hyped it up to be 'their longest biggest song ever' before the album release, then it gets undercut by the poem part.\u000a\u000aEven now, whenever I hear the album, I skip past the last seven minutes. I don't know why, but the poem outro just doesn't work for me. Like, I really like Imaginaerum as an album because I like almost-there interpretive storytelling pieces, but as an album-defining showstopper, Ghost River fills the thematic role better. It kind of doesn't work for me on the album, either, since Ghost River is the third song. It brings the whole album down.\u000a\u000aWhich is kinda sad, because the one thing I've always thought Nightwish was best at is that their epics are truly epic--Beauty of the Beast, Ghost Love Score and Poet &amp; the Pendulum are all tremendously detailed, fantastic works that I think manage to stand up as some of the most profound music pieces of the past twenty years. Song of Myself...not so much.
p3711
aVIt took me so long to like the poem. I was really disappointed by it too after all the hype, and used to skip it - I liked listening to the live versions where they stopped before the poem. But one day I decided try it again and it made me feel really emotional. There's just some really beautiful words in there. Though I'm still not keen on the opening of the poem where it's describing things he sees - I find it hard to relate to, whereas the later bits are more like universal truths.\u000a\u000aI was reassured to hear that their upcoming super long song The Greatest Show on Earth won't have so much of a big block of spoken word, apparently the speaking parts are shorter and more integrated with the music (a bit like in Bless The Child I guess).

p3715
aVThe live version of this song is my favourite.  On showtime, storytime Floor's vocals are amazing on it.

p3750
aVHmm, maybe try LiveNation or direct from the venue and see if either are any cheaper? I mean I think the tickets are £30 everywhere which is pretty standard for Nightwish, but that postage strikes me as very expensive.

They got engaged in August last year. Big congrats to them!

aVI agree.\u000aListened to the entire album through in lossless now, and I honestly reckon it's one of the best symphonic metal albums of the year.

asVKamelot Recommendations
p3767
(lp3768
Vfirst off, invest in **The Black Halo**. it's an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I couldn't pick and choose off that album and just have to say get the whole thing.\u000a\u000afrom their newer albums, starting with **Silverthorn** go with "Ashes to Ashes", "Torn", Song for Jolie", "Veritas", "My Confession", and the titletrack.\u000a\u000a**Poetry for the Poisoned** is a fairly weak album, the only songs I'd recommend off of it (not counting the ones you named) would "If Tomorrow Came", "Hunter's Season", "Seal of Woven Years", and "Once Upon A Time".\u000a\u000a**Ghost Opera**? I have 3 words for you. Rule The World. Beyond that go with the title track, "Love You To Death", "Mourning Star", and "Edenecho".\u000a \u000afurther back, for **Epica** I'd go with "Center of the Universe", "Farewell", "Wander", "On The Coldest Winder Night", and the bonus track "Like The Shadows".\u000a\u000afrom **Karma**, go with "Forever", "The Spell", "Don't You Cry", "Karma", "Across The Highlands", and the Elizabeth Bathory trilogy\u000a\u000a**Fourth Legacy** I'd go with the title track, "Nights of Arabia", "A Sailorman's Hymn", and "Alexandria".
p3769
aVAll of this, definitely.
p3770
aVThe Black Halo is one of the few albums ever made that I would consider a masterpiece. It is the centerfold of any Kamelot collection. That said, almost everything by Kamelot is fantastic. You cannot go wrong.
p3771
aVMy absolute favorite song of theirs is Center of the Universe.  I would say to pick up the One Cold Winter's Night DVD or soundtrack on iTunes, or check out the performances on Youtube.  The entire concert is gold and I honestly prefer those live tracks over their recorded versions.\u000a\u000aJust looking at what you have already, you might like:\u000a- Center of the Universe\u000a- Rule the World\u000a- Eden Echo\u000a- When the Lights Are Down\u000a- Memento Mori (starts slow and builds to epicness)\u000a- Elizabeth I, II, III (starts slow and builds to epicness)\u000a- Forever\u000a- Karma\u000a- Hunter's Season\u000a- Solitaire\u000a- My Confession\u000a- III Ways to Epica\u000a- The Fourth Legacy\u000a- Once Upon a Time\u000a\u000a(Most of their slower stuff is ridiculously beautiful)\u000a- Don't You Cry\u000a- A Sailorman's Hymn\u000a- Season's End\u000a- House on a Hill\u000a\u000a...I really like Kamelot.
p3772
aVSo from what I can tell of this thread, essentially, buy all the albums. They're all good.
p3773
aVPretty much, if your subbed to this subreddit I would almost consider Kamelot required listening. They really don't make a bad album in general and I'm so glad to see that the band is still picking up steam after the departure of Roy Khan. Sad to be missed but Tommy Karevik is a worthy successor.
p3774
aVDon't but the first two. Start with The Fourth Legacy. Skip Poetry for the Poisoned. 
p3775
aVSo start when Roy joined the band and skip Poetry for the Poisoned. 
p3776
aVI think a lot of their albums are worth listening to (especially Karma, Epica, The Black Halo and Silverthorn), but if I had to pick a favorite Kamelot track, it'd probably be Memento Mori from The Black Halo.\u000a\u000aAlso the Elizabeth song trilogy from Karma, which is pretty awesome.
p3777
aVI like to direct people to go back to the Fourth Legacy because it shows their roots, and makes the development through the albums more interesting.  In that sense, if you're looking at getting into Kamelot as a band, rather than hearing a few songs, starting at Fourth Legacy and moving forward to Ghost Opera would tap into what I think of as the core transformation of Kamelot from Power Metal into more Progressive Metal as time goes on.
p3778
aVThe Black Halo is probably my favourite by them. I really like Soul Society and Memento Mori.
p3779
aVI would recommend going album by album starting with the Fourth Legacy, at least through the Roy Khan era (that would be through Poetry for the Poisoned, although really I would recommend Fourth Legacy, Epica, Karma, Black Halo most strongly).
p3780
aVI'd say everything.  After seeing them in concert right after Roy (sad)  they had fabio Leone as the singer it was fabulous! And the new album comes out May 5th!
p3781
aVArtists such as Kamelot put a lot of work into making a whole concept or theme (rather than a collection of random songs) for each album release. So I'd recommend you pick an album and spend an hour with it. Don't try to piece together a "best of" collection of individual songs.
p3782
aVAll of the Roy Khan albums (except for Poetry For The Poisoned, which I found weak, comparetively, to earlier albums), most definitely. I haven't listened to Silverthorn nearly as much as I should be, because Tommy doesn't have the same vocal timbre (in my opinion) as Roy did.
p3783
aVEpica and The Black Halo are one continuous story. Some songs are better than others in terms of individual sound, but it's totally worth it to read up on the plot of the story, and then listen all the way through, trying to follow things as they happen.\u000a\u000aIn terms of individual songs, a few excellent ones that you haven't listed: Center of the Universe, III Ways To Epica, Serenade, Snow, and Wander/On The Coldest Winter Night if you like the softer stuff like Abandoned.
p3784
aVMy favorite track by them is probably The Black Halo from the album of the same name. The whole album is definitely worth listening to, though.
p3785
asVMaybe not symphonic, but still blew my mind.

asVHas Symphonic Metal been a bonding experience for anyone else?
p3791
(lp3792
VOn my first day of university I was feeling really shit. I was going to one of my classes, and came downstairs in my dorms to see a guy wearing a Nightwish hoodie, and because sometimes my brain/mouth filter doesn't work, I shouted "Nightwish!"\u000a\u000aHe's been one of my best friends for 3 years.
p3793
aVThat's awesome.
p3794
aVNone of my friends like symphonic metal, and all the people I meet who do like it seem to hate the bands I like. "Sonata Arctica? Nightwish? You're such a casual, here's some (unpronounceable, extremely obscure band) for you to learn from." I hate to put a negative spin on such a thread, but I have seen more snobbery in this genre than any other, and I have learned to be shameful of my musical tastes. What am I doing wrong?
p3795
aVI hear you, got the same problem. There really is no shame in liking the "big bands", they are big for a reason! Only listening to obscure bands is just being a hipster. I love Sonata Arctica and Nightwish, plenty of other big names, and plenty of obscure bands. I usually hang out at /r/PowerMetal, and I notice some snobbery over there as well (mainly, if you don't share the opinions of the "veterans" who have been there for a long time, they will go apeshit). I really dislike how people must assert their disapproval of others' opinions, while expecting unconditional respect for the opinions they themselves lord over others.
p3796
aVThere's elitist symphonic metal fans? That's rather interesting. Or did you just mean fans of metal in general? I mean, I've met plenty of people who hate symphonic metal because they think it's not heavy or obscure enough, but never people who were fans of the subgenre but only liked unknown bands - if you see what I mean.\u000a\u000aBut I would definitely say that you are not doing anything wrong. People being elitist about anything are just looking for an excuse to define themselves as slightly better than someone else, and this is something I've had to learn the hard way from hanging round with too many people like that. Often they hate on things without even having really tried them. I remember a guy saying "I hate symphonic metal, it all sounds the same." "What bands have you tried?" I asked. "Lacuna Coil?" was his reply. That was the only one he could think of, and they're not even a symphonic band! \u000a\u000aIt used to upset me so much that people dismissed the music I loved, but I eventually realised that if they wanted to miss out on it, it was their choice. The best successes I've had with bonding over symphonic metal were either converting existing friends to like it, meeting people at the concerts or chatting to others online. There are a ton of fans out there, they just might not be in your area - or if they are, they might not be advertising it because they might have been made to feel just as ashamed as you have. And that makes me sad. Symphonic metal is a wonderful and varied genre, don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
p3797
aVMetal has so many genres and sub genres, it sparks a lot of in fighting. And elitism is elitism is elitism. You aren't doing anything wrong. It's just the way things are. Enjoy the music you like and screw anyone who puts you down for it. I don't care if it's Nickelback and Justin Beiber. lol
p3798
aVI make my dad listen to some metal from time to time. He only enjoys symphonic metal, even if there's some growling. But any other kind, if there's growling or shredding or something, he starts telling me how bad this music sounds and how irritating it is.\u000a\u000aI don't know what it is that makes him like it more though. Maybe it's the mostly female vocals or the nice music. Have fun this Tuesday!
p3799
aVAbout six years ago I was at work and sitting with a few people I didn't know because I just got off sick leave. About half way through the shift, someone's phone goes off and I recognize the song. I said, "What song is that?" And he said, "It's called Bye Bye Beautiful, I don't know if you would have heard of it." I felt my face light up and I sat up straight in my chair. "Nightwish?!" He gets the same look on his face as I did mine and says, "Yeah!" We've been friends ever since and we're going to the Nightwish concert in Toronto along with another friend in April. =)
p3800
aVMy girlfriend and I are both fans of symphonic metal and have been since before we got together, over ten years ago. I wouldn't say the music has been a bonding experience, but it's one of those things that we share.

p3803
aVMy dad is the only person I know. None of friends will give it the time of day. It really is a shame it isn't pouolar in the US. I felt kinda bad for Xandria/Delain/Sonara Arctica that they couldn't even fill a small venue. Made me sad to see a great chain venue (House of Blues), in a major city (Orlando), in Downtown Disney, less than half full.\u000a\u000aBut you know what? Despite poor attendance, all three bands played their asses of for us. I'd even go so far as saying Xandria, the first ones on stage, totally stole the show. No one phoned in their performances. Was a great night.
p3804
aVIn my opinion symphonic metal is the odd metal genre since people who usually listen to metal look down on it (they say is too soft or sth), and people who listen to other genres don't like it because it is metal...\u000a\u000aIn my country there are almost no concerts with symphonic metal bands, my favorite band Diablo Swing Orchestra never set foot in my country, and even if there were concerts like this I have no1 to go with...

aVAt the moment I don't like the idea at all. Because Tarja's voice is overpowering and I feel like it would clash with Sharon's voice instead of contrasting. And because I'm dreading the amount of drama that Tarja brings with her (as someone who once got hate mail for giving her album 6/10). I've got this (fairly pessimistic) view that anything WT related is now going to be full of comments about either Tarja being better than Sharon or saying Tarja and Sharon should team up and beat up Tuomas... or that Within Temptation are the new Nightwish or... you can tell I've spent too much time reading this kind of stuff, right? :P\u000a\u000aThis is just my immediate knee-jerk reaction though. I am fully prepared to be proved wrong and I hope I actually love their voices in the song and everyone is nice about it.\u000a\u000aEdit: Already feeling more postive after the clip that Harkaen linked, it sounds really good at least, now only the drama to worry about it! 
p3842
aVThe Tarjaholics, as my dad and I call them, are just awful. She isn't gods gift to singing they make her out to be. Compared to other classicly trained operatic singers, she is only average, and without the right music to back her up, she isn't that good at all. With Nightwish, she had unique and powerful music composed by Tuomas and that is what made her and yet these people think she was the power in the band. Bye Bye Beautiful's lyrics really says it all. Did the Tarja fans listen to the music or the the actual words he wrote? Or were they just enchanted by the pretty girl.\u000a\u000aWondering if I will get hate mail now. -_-

So right now, Tuomas's solo album is still my album of the year (I had such an emotional response to it and instantly liked it) but I have a feeling that if people ask me at the end of the year I'll say TQE.

aVAgreed - been listening to it and Sacrificium on repeat all day and it's starting to stick, starting with the instrumental tracks to get the melody lines and then adding the vocals on top to fill in the details. \u000a\u000aThey're definitely not as quick to grasp as Epica's earlier works like Phantom Agony and Divine Conspiracy, though, where the melodies of the vocals and orchestra take on such a prominent role in the songs that you pick them up right away ('hummable' tunes, if you will). I guess some of us are still hoping they return to that earlier style, though it's highly unlikely.

p3951
aVI've noticed that there's a bit of a fan divide. I think it might be because Simone was a mezzo-soprano before, but with this album her range is full soprano, and that means she sounds different. is that maybe it?\u000a\u000aalso, Insomnium are goddamn wonderful
p3952
aVHonestly, I'm not sure. I mean, I didn't think it was bad by any means, it just didn't hook me like their other stuff has. Besides the single they released before, I can't really remember specific songs off hand. It all sounded good, just couldn't get into it. But hey, I've only listened to it twice so far. I'll give it a few more goes and hopefully it grows on me soon.\u000a\u000aRe Insomnium: Have you heard their new album yet?

p3984
aVI think you meant /r/PowerMetal. Still doesn't apply to them, in my opinion.
p3985
aVEeah, you're right. Damn RES autocomplete.
p3986
aVAmaranthe's a hard band to genre. they don't fit in here. they certainly ain't power or progressive. logically you'd think just posting at /r/metal is the safest bet, but if it isn't some obscure how-the-fuck-do-you-pronounce-that-band's-name black metal band, they slam it.\u000a\u000aand while this song's good, I think its one of the weaker songs on the album. Unreal and Digital World are my top 2 :)
p3987
aVI like to think of them as 'eurobeat metal', it's how I imagine a metal band would sound if it was combined with Eurovision inspired dance music. [Electroheart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2XRHToUAlo) being the most blatant.

V&gt;They actually told me point blank that I should just stop making music and they will never release Wintersun from the contract  \u000a\u000aThis really pisses me off. It all comes down to money with these record companies and they don't care about their artists. That's why bands like Protest the Hero become independent and they get to keep a lot of their revenue. Unfortunately, it looks like Nuclear Blast doesn't want that to happen and would rather shut down an artist. All because they would lose some money. I hope I'm wrong, but it wouldn't surprise me if Time II is never released.   \u000a\u000aedit: [Here](https://www.change.org/petitions/nuclear-blast-records-properly-support-wintersun-in-allowing-them-to-complete-time-ii) is a petition for Nuclear Blast to properly support Wintersun.

p4131
(lp4132
VIf you know them, it makes me sad that they are on this subreddit. They started out as such good gothic metal. Then, gradually, starting a little bit in Nine Destinies and a Downfall, they started going more symphonic, then more so in The 13th Floor, then all the way in The Enigma of Life, and still in Perils of the Deep Blue. I still love them, but it makes me sad that Morten left the strong (and very well done) gothic feel of his music. Oh well. This is a great song.
p4133
aVI actually thought this album was a return to more of a gothic style. But honestly, I really enjoy both gothic and symphonic metal, so I love albums like this one and, say, An Elixir for Existence, for different reasons.
p4134
aVI love both as well, and I wouldn't care at all except for the sorta sad lack of great Gothic metal still being written. He was doing so awesomely with At Sixes and Sevens and An Elixir for Existence that I just wish he would have made more.
p4135
aVYeah, it would be cool if he could do another side project that was more along those lines so we could have both!
p4136
aVCheck out Mortemia. Its his third band, he just has one album. But its pretty good, I hope he goes back to it. And maybe brings a girl on board. But then it might as well be Sirenia again, so I don't know
p4137
aVI feel the same way. I actually liked Nine Destinies and a Downfall the most, but 13th Floor was lacking something, it wasn't bad, but by The Enigma of Life, it was just more of the same, every song just sounded the same, had the same structure, similar lyrics... I just realized I was subconsciously avoiding listening to Perils of the Deep Blue, so that I wasn't disappointed again.
p4138
aVAt Sixes and Sevens remains my favorite, but Nine Destinies and a Downfall had some really good ones too, The Call and Glades of Summer come to mind. I think The 13th Floor had a similar issue to what happened on Dark Passion Play by Nightwish; a new singer. And while Sirenia had a different one every time until Ailyn stayed on, for some reason it kinda feels like that similar sort of disconnect that happened with Nightwish. I think it came from Ailyn's style; she's a symphonic/power singer, a la her guest appearance in The Chevalier by Serenity (awesome song). So yeah, that's how I feel about it.
p4139
aVMy favourite is One By One; that instrumental part before the last refrain is pure eargasm. And I actually really liked Dark Passion Play, the band just felt freed and unleashed for me, I didn't feel any disconnect. For me, the reason I didn't like 13th Floor is because it felt repetitive, and sort of dumbed down and tuned down, if that makes sense. And that repetitiveness was just dialed up to eleven in The Enigma of Life, just every damn song the same damn thing. Ailyn's style is pretty good, so I actually think it's the unwillingness of Morten to try something new, at least that's how it seems to me. Even the Mortemia album is just Sirenia without a female singer, the songs sound the same, the structure is the same. It's a damn shame, the man was a genius. I think he needs a real band, with other people contributing and evolving the musical style forward, not just doing everything by himself.\u000a\u000aGreat song btw, haven't heard it before.
p4140
aVThat's a really good point about him having a full band there with him. I didn't really think about that before. And I guess for me with Annette in DPP I just felt like she stuck out like a sore thumb, like they hadn't fit her in just right yet. I love the Lacrimas Profundere type of sound and feel, and old Sirenia had that in a way that new Sirenia doesn't. It's not that it's bad, it great, but I don't close my eyes and end up in foggy forests and breezy castle corridors at night with the new stuff :)
p4141
aVI'd definitely recommend giving the new album ago. I felt the same way about The Enigma of Life, it was very samey. Though PotDB is more of the same style, Ailyn's singing has vastly improved and she does some interesting things with her voice, and in general it just seems like Morten made an effort to mix things up a bit.
p4142
aVYeah, I will definitely give it a go. I listened to the song you posted, and while it was better than anything I heard on TEoL, it still sounds pretty generic, so I'm not getting my hopes up. Maybe I will get a nice surprise.
p4143
asVKamelot Fans: Khan or Tommy?
p4144
(lp4145
VAs a fan who's been listening to Kamelot since *The Black Halo*, I'm going to have to go with Khan. His voice was very unique within the Power Metal scene and Metal in general. *Epica* remains one of my favorite Kamelot albums and Roy's performance in that album is amazing. Tommy is great, he is a tenor and obviously has a wider range than Khan did, but I like him more for Seventh Wonder. I feel, at least with *Silverthorn*, that he was somewhat holding back and trying to sound like Khan. But then again, it all comes down to personal taste. 
p4146
aVAs a very casual fan, I like them both equally. They have similar voices, I think.
p4147
aVI think right now I prefer Khan primarily because of his lyrics. I don't think Tommy is particularly bad at writing, but lyrically Silverthorn was no Epica. But, I am on board with Tommy singing and I believe that anything is possible in Kamelot's future!
p4148
aVI will shamefully admit that I was never too into Kamelot until Tommy joined the band. Silverthorn is one of my favorite albums now, heh.
p4149
aVI was kind of the same way. Silverthorn didn't get me into Kamelot, but it did get me back into Kamelot. I listened to The Black Halo for a while and then just forgot about them. :'( But thanks to Tommy, I've seen them twice now. He's extremely nice, met him after a show once!
p4150
aVI've never been able to see either of them live (They don't visit Canada much and when they do, not in Alberta &gt;.&lt;). But I've always loved Khans vocals and what got me into metal as a genre (Sonata Arctica and Within Temptation also helped).\u000a\u000aThough Tommy is great also, eagerly waiting to hear their next album with more of a Tommy twist than Silverthorn.
p4151
aVI can't wait to hear what he will do next! I feel like on Silverthorn he wasn't able to use his range quite as much because they were kind of still writing with Khan in mind, but Tommy's range is incredible and I love everything he's ever been a part of. Just a great talent he is.
p4152
aVI feel like with some of Kamelot's older songs (I'm thinking the *Epica/Black Halo* era and before), Khan's voice brings something really unique to the albums.  But I never managed to see them live with Khan (but the videos of Khan live are seriously impressive), and so I've only seen Tommy... and Tommy was absolutely amazing on stage.  He's got an amazing presence and a great voice, and he's just a really awesome and sweet person (I splurged and got VIP tickets...).  \u000a\u000aI will say though, Tommy was a brilliant choice on Kamelot's part.  Khan's voice has some unique quality to it that I can't quite name, but Tommy's range covers it well enough that he does a good job performing older Kamelot songs.  *Silverthorn* is pretty good, but it seems written for Khan, but now that Kamelot's got a much better idea of Tommy's voice, I have faith the next album will be awesome :)
p4153
aVI'm fans of both. Heard about Tommy since the beginning of Seventh Wonder and Khan since Epica. Tommy is prob my second favorite singer and Khan being #1 (albeit imo miles ahead of Tommy still). I'm classically trained and can tell when someone is singing the notes vs singing the song. Tommy satisfies the old songs but he is missing "something". Also if you've heard the Fourth Legacy or anything he has done in Conception you know Roy had a higher range than Tommy.
p4154
aVAs a whole, I prefer Tommy, though I slightly prefer his vocals in Seventh Wonder.\u000a\u000aRegarding Kamelot, Khan offered something unique, and very enjoyable. It's sad that that's gone. However, given that he *did* leave, Tommy's a fantastic choice. Silverthorn is easily one of Kamelot's best albums, and I can't wait to see where they go from here. So, all in all, I wouldn't have wished to see Tommy replace Khan, but I also wouldn't want to see Khan replace Tommy.
p4155
aVI LOOOOVE Seventh Wonder. Holy crap, they're so good.
p4156
aVI'm gonna give it to Tommy I think. I saw them live with him, and he did such a mindblowing job that I hardly know what could top it. I personally like Tommy's voice a little better than Khan's as well. I can't really say one is better than the other, but for myself I go with Tommy all the way. Especially him doing The Human Stain and March of Mephisto live. And Ghost Opera. And When The Lights Are Down. And The Haunting. And I'll stop now hahaha

p4269
aV&gt; 70,000 Tons of Metal\u000a\u000aI'm a little confused on the [pricing](http://70000tons.com/booking/pricing.php). If you buy a 2 person room, you have to pay 1,200 per person right? And if you go alone, you still have to pay that full 2 person price?
p4270
aVIt says you can pay $100 extra to go alone and they will match you up with another passenger to fill the room. And looks like you have to pay $333 dollars on top for taxes etc as well. It seems crazily expensive to me but then those are the fancier cabins, plus you are getting both a festival and a Caribbean cruise, I guess.

sVCan someone explain to me if there is a difference between symphonic metal and gothic metal?
p4305
(lp4306
VIt's probably somewhat contentious, but since there's no official Dictionary of Metal, this is how I see it:\u000aThey're not mutually exclusive. One refers to instrumentation, the other refers to overall theme/style. Symphonic metal contains, well, symphonic elements - sounds that you would hear in a symphony, like violins, cellos, trumpets, etc. These sounds can be produced by electronic keyboard (as they usually are for practical and budgetary reasons) or actual "real" orchestral instruments.\u000a\u000aGothic metal can (and often do) include symphonic sounds (perhaps most notably organs) but describes a darker style of sound and lyrical theme. \u000a\u000aIf I were to categorize them relative to each other, I'd say that gothic metal is *mostly* a subgenre of symphonic metal, with some parts of the former outside the latter in cases where no symphonic sounds are used (i.e. sticking solely to vocals, bass, guitar, and drums). \u000a
p4307
aVI agree with what you said. I would just add that when I describe Gothic Metal I describe it as playing with the duality of sounds between male grunts and clear female voices, with music to go along with it (often more melodic sounds to go along with the female, and heavier sounds to go with the male).
p4308
aVHmm. well, it doesn't always, there are straight sexed Gothic metal bands, but I think we can all admit that multi sexed bands are more popular.
p4309
aVHistorically symphonic metal has come from thrash and power metal where as goth metal used to be very specifically doom metal mixed with goth rock. Since then goth metal has expanded a bit and we have bands like Delain, Elysion, etc. Because of goth's (by definition) obsession with the romantic period, they often incorporate romatic era style music, which is where their symphonic context comes from, but this is by no means a requirement.\u000a\u000aSomething can easily be in both genres simultaneously, as /u/Timmyc62 said the features are mostly orthogonal. Although I disagree with his statement that goth metal is mostly a sub-genre of symphonic metal there is often a lot of overlap between the two.
p4310
aVThe degree of overlap is what I was trying to illustrate by saying gothic is *mainly* a subgenre of symphonic - imagine a large circle for symphonic, with a smaller gothic circle inside it near the edge with a bit of it sticking outside the symphonic circle. 
p4311
aVI understood what you were saying but I disagree. I imagine there are just as many gothic metal bands that would be considered symphonic as not. More like a traditional Venn diagram, with a good bit of overlap between symphonic metal and gothic metal but large portions of unique parts.\u000a\u000aLooking at [Wikipedia's list of gothic metal bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gothic_metal_bands). I tried to categorize them as symphonic vs. non-symphonic. I basically searched the page and if the word symphonic appeared on it I would throw it into symphonic (with 4 exceptions which I discuss). The final total was 67 non-symphonic gothic metal bands vs 44 symphonic metal gothic bands. I think while this isn't rigorous, it's pretty convincing evidence to say that gothic metal is not "mainly a subgenre of symphonic". \u000a\u000aHere is the actual categorization with notes if you're curious. https://linx.li/859ed14.txt
p4312
aVNice work! I admire the legwork you've done for this - clearly I was hasty with my statement. 
p4313
aVTo be honest, I was actually a bit surprised at the result too. I thought it would be more evenly split.
p4314
aVI think the reason many symphonic metal bands are tagged as gothic would be because of the dark atmosphere and lyrical themes of their music. However, musically they're very different as gothic metal incorporates electronic/wave/industrial sounds. Also, this happens because bands like Theater of tragedy were some of the first bands to have the "beauty and the beast" vocals which are now common in symphonic metal. Try listening to [Theater of Tragedy](http://youtu.be/7hzmd3Dp3cg), [Lacrimosa](http://youtu.be/8g0B6Qpnsjg), [old Tristania](http://youtu.be/9KYtZ6SRSGQ), or [Théâtre des Vampires](http://youtu.be/RQjyIw-vG8U) to hear the differences. \u000a\u000aEdit: Added links
p4315
aVmmmmmm those aformentioned bands are 4 of my favorites.
p4316
aVThe definition of "gothic metal" has become a bit loose over the years. Originally, gothic metal evolved out of death/doom metal and gothic rock, with lots of slow ponderous riffs and atmospheric elements. Sometimes those atmospherics were achieved with orchestral instruments, but just as often it'd be with synths or whatever. As the definition of gothic metal expanded over the years, some people have applied it to music that is quite far from this original gothic music. \u000a\u000aSometimes this problem is increased by the fact that some symphonic bands started as gothic. Within Temptation *were* gothic metal at one point in their careers. Go look up the song "restless" to hear an example of what gothic WT sounded like. Not really the same as modern WT, is it? After Forever is another example of a band that started gothic but ended up symphonic. I think this leads to mislabeling, as people say "well, WT is labelled as gothic, and this sounds kind of like that song of their new album, so it must be gothic as well".\u000a\u000aNot to mention there is just plain old confusion since both genres tend to predominantly use female lead vocals, unlike other metal subgenres.
p4317
aVgothic metal first branched off from doom metal which is clearly nothing near symphonic metal. its just that some gothic metak bands started having female vocals and slow depressing orchestrations. and since some people think that any band with a female singer is symphonic metal... 
p4318
aV[deleted]
p4319
aVI've heard many times people use the term goth metal for any band with a female front singer... I remember Evanescence being described as goth rock... So they wear black... Who cares... Wouldn't a correct statement of 'goth' metal refer to gothic period musical influence?  
p4320
aVNo, there are many gothic bands that don't go into the gothic period. Evanescence is (no matter what they say) a gothic rock band that has attained success in the pop arena. Their lyrics are dark, brooding perhaps, self introspective definitely. But the look of a band certainly is a part of the genre definition as well. You can't deny that it would be weird as hell to see Liv Kristine and Alexander Krull strutting around dressed like I don't know any pop bands but you can insert names here.\u000a\u000aDressing in a gothic style, and singing lyrics with gothic influence, adding in gothic elements to your videos, and you get a goth influence on your genre and rightfully so.\u000a\u000aEDIT:spelling

aVAnette is consistently referred to as "the vocalist", not by name. Did she object to her name being in the documentary too? \u000a\u000aIt only means more time for Floor though :-)
p4333
aVIt's all a bit confusing. I think she said she didn't want any mention of her on the DVD. Originally she stated that she didn't know about it until after it was announced, which puzzled the director who said she was filmed and gave interviews for it, and it started a bit of an argument between fans and Anette. From everything I've read, I think the truth must be that she knew about the documentary but thought it would be cancelled when she left, but then it was announced that it would be released and that it would have show with Floor on it (which Tuomas explained as a last-minute decision because Nuclear Blast wanted a live show), and at that point she wrote to them saying she wanted to be edited out.\u000a\u000aShe also commented on her blog that it was the portrayal of Tarja on the last DVD that made her not want to be involved, but I'm confused by that as well. I don't remember anything on that making Tarja look particularly bad.
p4334
aVWasn't it the book that came out after Tarja left that portrayed her poorly? Or at least said some nasty things about her husband, who proceeded to take legal action against the band over it?

The lyrics don't paint the same picture, and the music isn't as colorful of a backdrop for her fantastic voice. And I really miss that over the top operatic style from the aforementioned songs. Still, I wish her well, since she's still one of my favorite singers of all time. 
p4346
aVI think one of the reasons for the lack of depth might be that most of her songs are written by a [Swedish pop band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_\u005c(band\u005c)) and others by different songwriters. She does contribute though, I'd be really interested to know  how much she works on them. She has written three ballads at least.

VFrom the post:\u000a&gt;Dear Fans &amp; Friends,\u000a\u000a&gt;good news from Mastersound Studio!\u000a\u000a&gt;We are in the midst of recording Leaves' Eyes new full-length album.\u000a\u000a&gt;The album's concept is rooted in a highly important chapter in the history of Norway. The sagas of Norway's kings and the middle-ages has always been of great interest to me and it's such a pleasure to compose and record this huge soundtrack with my dream team here at Mastersound Studio. Thanx to my guys for these enchanting tunes and killer production!\u000aThe album will be released in the second half of 2015.\u000a\u000a&gt;More news will follow soon!\u000a\u000a&gt;Love,\u000a\u000a&gt;Liv and Leaves' Eyes\u000a\u000a\u000aLooks like a return to the band's more traditional theme; I rather liked Symphonies of the Night and would've liked had they continued to do something different like that, but I suppose this should be good too.

V[Here's](http://youtu.be/bCZoslZsr2U) an adequate depiction of Simone's vocal range. She's still a mezzo because her tessitura (where she sings more comfortably) is still falls in the C4-B5 area. She's been singing using more head voice in the latest singles, which might give the impression that she is singing higher (which she is, at least than the usual), but we'll have to see how well she can execute this higher range live.

sVNew bands suggestions.
p4402
(lp4403
VI'm a big fan of Kamelot.  As for albums, I would start with Karma, Epica, and Black Halo.
p4404
aVHere are my band suggestions and albums/songs for you to start with:\u000a\u000a1. **Xandria - "Neverworld's End"**: The composition and vocals are similar in style to Nightwish's "Once" album. Since you like Once, you'll like Neverworld's End. Xandria's prior material is popular, but it has a much different feel (and different vocalists) and you may or may not like it as much. *Recommended Songs*: [Propecy of World's to Fall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vLwWtSwNTI) and [The Nomad's Crown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNAEXNEpimc)\u000a\u000a2. **Delain - Lucidity**: Most people seem to recommend their "April Rain" album, but since you pointed out WT's The Heart of Everything, this album came to my mind. However, I recommend songs from both. *Recommended Songs*: [Frozen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhN4T4uhIWE), [No Compliance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT3_B3K_L6U), and [April Rain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzP0aY6BOjw)\u000a\u000a3. **Epica - "Design Your Universe"**: If you'll ever fall in love with Epica, it will probably be with this album. It's heavy, complex, and bombastic. *Recommended Songs*: [Kingdom of Heaven](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRO117a_R8), and [Unleashed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNGzltK_tlc). Some people prefer Epica's older material though because it focuses more on symphonic melodies. A good older album to try is **"The Phantom Agony"** to see if you like that style. *Recommended Songs*: [The Phantom Agony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtHgEwfiyNY) and [Cry for the Moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjCivwBy-Bo)\u000a\u000a4. **After Forever - "After Forever"**: After Forever has a similar prog metal influence like Epica (they share common origins with Mark Jansen). This album features some electronic sounding elements that are not in their first albums. *Recommended Songs*: [Energize Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjm4BrNAf6s) and [Dreamflight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtqppn--D_c)\u000a\u000a5. **Apocalyptica - "Worlds Collide"**: Apocalyptica is a Cello quartet turned metal band. They usually are just instrumental but they have lots of songs featuring vocalists as well. I personally prefer vocalized music over instrumental, so I recommend songs that feature vocalists. *Recommended Songs*: [I Don't Care](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxDcWvZCSRg) and [S.O.S.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFZ9e4wx1H8)\u000a\u000a6. **Kamelot - "Epica" &amp; "The Black Halo"**: These albums are a two-part concept album featuring some of the greatest lyrics EVER. Kamelot is a power metal band primarily, so stylistically, this is different than your typical symphonic metal band. *Recommended Songs*: [Wander](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4nzFmyNfw) and [Soul Society](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDubchjrz1I)\u000a\u000a7. **Myrath - Tales of the Sands**: If you want to listen to a symphonic band based on Arabic melodies instead of Western symphony, then this is a must listen. It is a fresh twist on what you'll hear in this subreddit. *Recommended Songs*: [Tales of the Sands](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1g62x7qybA) and [Merciless Times](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMvqMHST2Is)\u000a\u000a8. **Septic Flesh - "The Great Mass"**: This is the heaviest band/album I'm linking to you, and you may not like it at all. Septic Flesh is Symphonic Death Metal, so expect the focus to be on harsh vocals and heavy guitars. However, the classic symphony melodies are so masterfully intertwined in their songs that I cannot make a list like this without including them. *Recommended Songs*: [A Great Mass of Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBq_njJMdHg) and [Pyramid God](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoXrADZE4Rc)\u000a\u000aHope you find something new in there that you enjoy!
p4405
aVMy favourite bands are Nightwish and WT, so I'll have to cast my net a little wider, lol. I think you should definitely pursue more Epica. *Design You Universe* was the album that really made me love them - I feel like they are a more album-oriented band and you get a better feel for them by listening to whole albums than to their singles.\u000a\u000aDelain would be another good one to get into - *April Rain* got me hooked on them, and their new album coming out in a week or so is good too. Since you like Nightwish, you might want to check out Tarja/Anette's solo careers or Floor Jansen's other bands, After Forever and ReVamp. You could always use free streaming things like Spotify or Last.fm so that you can try as much as possible!\u000a\u000aAlso check out the sidebar link for an A-Z of Symphonic Metal bands if you ever need more to get into. :)
p4406
aVDo you like extreme metal? If so, check out [Fleshgod Apocalypse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sACuX2c9w8s). It is pretty much brutal death metal backed by an entire orchestra that is actually very well orchestrated.\u000a\u000aAnother great band, and slightly less extreme/more melodic is [Wintersun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm82gjZDIDU). This was one of the first symphonic artists I really got into.\u000a\u000a[Summoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipoikwHRb8) is a black metal band that, although they use harsh vocals, really isn't that harsh. They are very atmospheric and peaceful. I often listen to these guys when I need to relax.\u000a\u000aIf you aren't into any extreme metal and prefer clean vocals, my only suggestion that hasn't been said already is [Blind Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ts8cPScXM).\u000a\u000aThe other posts in this thread are excellent suggestions as well, but I just wanted to throw in a few from other metal subgenres.
p4407
aVTry Epica with The Phantom Agony. The whole album though, like HarlequinValentine said, their albums are designed as a whole and really benefit from being listened as a whole. TPA being the best imo, almost all their album is a must-listen.\u000a\u000aTry Sirenia, Krypteria, Xandria, Stratovarius. You can also try towards Rhapody of Fire/Apocalyptica.\u000a\u000aOh and, the one and only Therion.\u000a\u000aYou can also try Cradle of Filth, I personnaly don't like them but they are still considered as symphonic metal.
p4408
aVIf you enjoy Nightwish (my personal favourite) and Within Temptation you will probably like Leaves' Eyes too. I can't believe it hasn't been mentioned yet, they're pretty big! \u000a\u000aSome other great bands that have already been mentioned: Epica, ReVamp, Therion (they pretty much invented the genre), After Forever, Tarja.\u000a\u000aSorry for not providing links, I'm on mobile. Some songs to check out:\u000a\u000aTherion - To Mega Therion, Arrow from the Sun\u000aTarja - In for a Kill\u000aEpica - Design Your Universe, Unleashed, Chasing the Dragon\u000aReVamp - Precibus, Trial of Monsters\u000aLeaves' Eyes - Symphony of the Night, Elegy, Froya's Theme, Battle of Maldon\u000a
p4409
aVBranch into Power Metal if you haven't tried it yet.  [Dark Moor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV2mZE6KwE&amp;feature=kp) and [Rhapsody of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5kLxQGbRYg) are some of my favorites.
p4410
aVI love Epica, a good song to listen to by them is [Requiem For The Indifferent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhn0Wdc-tNM) from their album Requiem for the Indifferent. It's a great song that has everything, but my favorite album of theirs was Design your Universe. Definitely think you should start listening to them.\u000a\u000aAfter Forever also had songs similar to Epica as they both shared similar members, but Floor was their lead singer and they weren't totally the same people so things sound different. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EguHM_8rgDY) is a sample song to see what they sound like. They don't exist anymore, but Epica is the closest thing.\u000a\u000aI also think Amberian Dawn is quite an overlooked band as well. I really liked them when they had Heidi Parviainen as their lead singer, but when she left and was replaced with Capri, I started to like them less. I hated how they had Capri re-do the songs that Heidi did, but that's just me. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2R8_0NCW4A) is a sample song by them.\u000a\u000aFloor was also in ReVamp before she officially joined Nightwish, I don't listen to them as much as others, but they might still be worth checking out.
p4411
aVReVamp is still very much active! Nightwish won't stop Floor from continuing her own project. And it's definitely worth checking out, I recommend both their albums without reservation. 
p4412
aVIn fact they will be touring in the US next month!
p4413
aV[deleted]
p4414
aVDefinitely [Kamelot](http://grooveshark.com/#!/profile/Kamelot/22186712). Been my favorite band for several years. Brilliant music.\u000a\u000a[Charon](http://grooveshark.com/#!/profile/Charon/22241677) is technically "gothic metal" but similar enough that you should check them out. \u000a\u000a[Sonata Arctica](http://grooveshark.com/#!/sonata_arctica) you've mentioned. I'd say they're somewhat of an acquired taste. Personally I go back and forth between loving them and cooling down. Favorite album is Winterheart's Guild.\u000a\u000a[Freedom Call](http://grooveshark.com/#!/freedomcall). Technically power metal, but the genres have quite a bit of overlap.\u000a\u000aCheers!

aVBesides what was already mentioned I can only suggest some old [Tristania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBjd2O2k3h0)
p4418
aVI can't recommend Epica enough! Their whole discography is excellent. Particularly their newer stuff. More polished, heavier. The arrangements are great. Requiem for the Indifferent, Design Your Universe and The Divine Conspiracy are the albums you should check out first. The Divine Conspiracy was the first symphonic that I fell in love with Check out Kamelot too. Usually I prefer a female voice with symphonic metal, but Kamelot is an exception. Ghost Opera, The Black Halo and Silverthorn are my favorite albums.

VWhile I agree with the widely held view that Therion's best stuff is from quite a few years ago (*Theli*, *Secret of the Runes*, *Sirius B*), this insane art project proved to me that they've still got it. Taking French pop songs from the 60s and 70s and then turning those into such a great symphonic metal album is like magic to me.
p4424
aVAgreed. *Les Fleurs du Mal* is not my favourite Therion album, but I really respect that they are not afraid to test new bold ideas like that one. If you are an innovative and experimental band, some of your experiments are inevitably going to be not as successful as others.

aVThe lyrics sound so funny in this context.\u000a\u000a&gt; Je vois la vie en rose bonbon\u000a\u000aThat's one of the last things you'd expect to hear on a Therion song; it's still awesome though.

Two grand orchestras \u2013 each featuring 90 musicians \u2013 also lend their brilliant talents to the new recordings with absolutely spellbinding results.  \u000a\u000aI can't fucking wait
p4445
aV*At the Edge of Time* is my favourite Blind Guardian album. The songs *Sacred Worlds*  and *Wheel of Time* are particularly epic.

asVUpcoming Symphonic Metal Albums In 2015
p4449
(lp4450
VOther than [Haggard's album Grimm](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/2r3c86/haggard_grimm_will_be_out_in_2015/) I can't give you any concrete information, but these three bands are worth keeping an eye out for:\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aDiablo Swing Orchestra released a single in late 2014 and will presumably complete their new album in 2015. I haven't been able to find anything definitive. (Also, I'd call them "experimental metal with symphonic elements" or something like that. Not really symphonic metal, and it's a damn shame their amazing soprano left.)\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aEihwaz is still looking for funding for their new album. It was originally planned for late 2014... Their song *[Amadeus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkdHRNnb6g)* is incredible, and the rest of their debut was good too. I really hope they'll find enough funds to produce a second album.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp;\u000a\u000aTherion has been making vague promises about an upcoming "rock opera" for several years now. Some songs have been played at live shows, and last year a tentative date of late 2014 was given. So maybe 2015 will be the year. I really liked their last, the *[Fleurs des Mal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFD7YIk_9dw)* cover album, as insane as the idea sounded.
p4451
aVThanks for the suggestions! I'll add them in. There seems to be a lot of albums that are supposed to come out but don't have any official date. I've just seen Tarja's record label saying she would release something as well.
p4452
aVGood to see Haggard's elusive Grimm is finally nearing release. Hopefully they have less of the cookie monster vocals in this album in comparison to their previous work.\u000a\u000aAlso, if I remember correctly, the (very) recently released limited print DVD has some of the new material on it, so a 2015 release sounds likely. I didn't particularly dislike Les Fleurs du Mal, but I feel like it's a step back from their previous albums (excluding Sitra Ahra). Perhaps 2015 will finally be the year Therion returns to it's best, but for now I'm remaining skeptical.
p4453
aVTo clarify: The Rock Opera based on A Short Tale Of The Antichrist is not vague, he is pretty much finished writing but needs an investor to make it happen.

(lp4476
VI really want to hate Dimmu Borgir for what they did to Mustis and ICS Vortex, but this track is awesome!  
p4477
aVLet's look at the bright side - ICS Vortex is now singing in Arcturus and Borknagar, so we can have more awesome bands.
p4478
aVYeah... this track is an april's fools joke... hate to burst your bubble.
p4479
aVSo, the email Xanthochroid sent yesterday was still part of the April fool's joke?
p4480
aVYep. Go to their youtube channel. They have all sorts of other jokes on their. They have their joke "band" Epic Dragon that makes fun of Children of Bodom and other run of the mill melodeath bands. They also had a very Rammstein sounding song as well. It is all satire, they are funny blokes, sure, but this particular april fools joke seems to have poor delivery.\u000a\u000aI am sure if you relisten to this song and listen to some more recent Dimmu you will be able to pick out the differences that show it is a fake.
p4481
aVWell, guess I fell for it. But, joke aside, that's a decent song.

asVFor those of you that have listened to The Quantum Enigma: what did you think?
p4488
(lp4489
VI'm just hoping the Earbook version doesn't take weeks to ship to me after the release date...
p4490
aVThat's been happening to me a lot. I didn't get the Hydra book until over a month after it's release, even though I preordered it. I also pre-ordered the book edition of Lacuna Coil's Broken Crown Halo a week in advance and I got an email a few weeks after release saying it was sold out and no longer available. I know Lacuna Coil is Century Media but they have some relation with Nuclear Blast. Hope they get their shit together for this.
p4491
aVI prefer to wait for the CD, I just find that it's then a lot more exciting when I get the album in the post. I'm pretty sad that it leaked, really - I mean, most people have hopefully pre-ordered it already so I doubt it will make a huge difference. But the more this happens, the more labels will stop sending albums out to reviewers and probably stop posting things before release day. And I'm sure the band will be disappointed.
p4492
aVI don't really think leaks are uniformly bad. I suspect there are not many people who would not buy the album only if it leaked early. It'll be online one way or the other. [This paper](http://www.scribd.com/doc/93891327/Hammond-File-Sharing-Leak) tries to empirically measure what a leak means in terms of album sales.\u000a\u000aThat said I'm the same as you. I'd much rather wait for the album. I've looked at the track previews and the singles released, but I trust the band and label to decide what the best first experience with the album should be. 
p4493
aVBefore this album, I would go back and forth between whether my favorite Epica album is Design Your Universe or the The Phantom Agony. Now I think I'll be stuck between three albums. There is so much that I like about The Quantum Enigma, but a couple of things that hold it back from being the clear winner.\u000a\u000a\u000aPros:\u000a\u000a* I absolutely love the concept for the sound of the album. It has some of the heaviest use of orchestration in a while, very catchy choruses and hooks, and solid guitar riffs. It's almost as moody as The Phantom Agony while being as heavy as Design Your Universe. The sound is richer and fuller than ever.\u000a* Quality lyrics once again. Philosophical, spiritual, and just down-right brilliant ideas. I'm glad they didn't stray too far into quantum physics and kept things relatable to the human experience. \u000a* The opener and the interlude are perfect!\u000a* Lots of stand out tracks. The Second Stone, The Essence of Silence, and Sense without Sanity are my favorites, but there are so many good ones that I could see my favorites list changing after each listen.\u000a* Virtually every song has a big moment where it takes you by surprise and raises the track to a new level.\u000a* Simone's vocals are her best. Some operatic leanings, but smooth at the same time. She conveys so many emotions, it's just wonderful.\u000a\u000a\u000aCons:\u000a\u000a* Not enough variation in song length. I'm glad they didn't bloat songs needlessly just for the sake of length, but I wish we had gotten more of the structural complexity that only a long track can provide.\u000a* ~~TQE is missing a strong ballad track (like Delirium, Solid Ground, or Tides of Time). While the interlude helps, the album feels less varied than previous releases. However, this might be a positive depending on your taste.~~ \u000a* The title track was a little underwhelming. It's a great song, but not quite as good as some of the other lengthy tracks Epica has done. Maybe I'm a little more critical of this point since Sense without Sanity is the only other track over 7 minutes in length.\u000a\u000aEdit: Canvas of Life is an amazing ballad track.
p4494
aV&gt; TQE is missing a strong ballad track (like Delirium, Solid Ground, or Tides of Time)\u000a\u000aTo me, Canvas of Life is a ballad and a pretty good one.   \u000a\u000a&gt;The title track was a little underwhelming. It's a great song, but not quite as good as some of the other lengthy tracks Epica has done.    \u000a\u000a~~I agree with you on that. Maybe it's because I've only listened to it a few times, but it doesn't really stand out to me. That was the song I had the biggest hopes for. Maybe it will get better after a few listens.~~  \u000aAfter listening to the whole album a million times already, I really love this track. I didn't really appreciate it at first, but it's a beautiful song with an epic orchestral composition.
p4495
aVHoly crap! How did I forget about Canvas of Life?! I fully retract that statement.
p4496
aVListening to it now, and I have to say, I was hooked on Victim of Contingency. Really liking the sound. Very heavy.
p4497
aVDamn... DYU and RFTI were already excellent albums, but this might be their first true masterpiece. I still need to listen to it more and "digest" the various songs, but it's an extremely impressive album so far, with amazing songwriting, production, mixing and performances and overall good lyrics. Hopefully we'll get the 320 kbps version soon, along with the bonus tracks, which so far sound pretty great. Assuming Opeth's Pale Communion doesn't impress me even more, this is definitely my album of the year, and my favorite Epica album too.
p4498
aVTotally hooked by The Second Stone at the moment. Whoa :D\u000a\u000aFYI it has leaked (in good quality, 95% complete), so *everyone* should be listening right now ;-)
p4499
aVI'm the same way. I've been singing it to myself all day at work. I've only listened to the first 5 songs. I can't wait to go home and finish listening to the rest. 
p4500
aVSounds promising. Their last few albums have been incredibly boring and "safe" so to speak, so hopefully I'll like this one.
p4501
aVThanks for the tip, I had no idea! Gotta study for my last exam that's tomorrow morning but now I know what I'm going to do all afternoon :)
p4502
aV95% complete?  Is it missing a song or something?
p4503
aVLast song is corrupted I've heard? I haven't reached that point yet though
p4504
aVIt seems like it ends abruptly (~10 seconds early), but other than that it's all good.
p4505
aVI wish I could find the stupid leak, the couple of supposed downloads I found turned out to be fake.
p4506
aV[deleted]
p4507
aVThis album is fantastic. After being mildly disappointed by Within Temptation's Hydra and surprised by Delain's album, Epica managed to top just about everything I've heard in this genre (for me at least).\u000a\u000aI previously would have said that Within Temptation was my favorite symphonic metal group but I think that Epica may be the new reigning band for me now. I didn't think they'd top Design Your Universe but damn did they ever. 
p4508
aVIt's different, and at the same time, I am in complete awe. Design Your Universe has been my favourite album from them, and I would listen to it at least once a day since release for about a year since release. It has been the album I've recommended to many people to introduce them to Epica. I feel that has changed, and for the better.\u000a\u000aThe ones that stick out to me the most is Natural Corruption, Chemical Insomnia (with The Fifth Guardian interlude), and The Second Stone. They're catchy, sophisticated, and not lacking in any way as I had anticipated after Requiem for the Indifference.\u000a\u000aI thought they couldn't top DYU, but for me, the album is a perfect 10/10. Some songs weren't what I expected them to be, but I am pleasantly surprised they weren't. That's just from listening to the samples over and over again. When it releases here on Tuesday, I'm definitely going to go buy it from my local music store.
p4509
aVEasily one of my favorites. Just like with DYU and RFTI, it's one of those albums where it takes three or four listens to fully sink in, but with each listen it just becomes more and more wonderful.\u000a\u000aSimone sounds great, the guitars are strong, I love the amount of choirs and orchestra. I'm just waiting to get my actual order in the mail this week so I can listen to bonus tracks like Dreamscape and whatnot. 
p4510
aVDreamscape is fucking amazing! Both the regular and acoustic versions are phenomenal. 
p4511
aVAbsolutely brilliant.. There's nothing wrong with this album, but.. I prefer the new Ancient Bards album. That one has lots more oddities which don't make sense, like the fact that a chorus which is (according to the story) supposed to be sung by a daughter, but it is sung by a male vocalist (!). However, that album has lots more really fun tracks that stand out.\u000a\u000aTo me the Quantum Enigma is great, in some senses it lacks ambition. \u000a\u000aIf you look at the new ancient bards album and compare it to TQE, the first thing you notice is that the Ancient Bards album has 3 tracks fewer, but has longer tracks (a 12+ minute track and a 16+ minute track). However, it does require of the listener to accept a bad English accent, mostly on the first track.\u000aShort comparison: epica has better lyrics, ancient bards better general writing.

VI like it. I mean it goes from dramatic epicness to anthemn-like and energy pumping a little too quickly. So that is off putting at first, but once you accept it for what it is, you have a fun little song.\u000a\u000aI am also from a place heavily influenced by rap culture so I also may have a much higher tolerance for rap than a lot symphonic metal fans. So don't take my opinion as absolute.

p4553
aVI don't care for rapping in metal, especially in symphonic metal. It also makes the song sound dated, like it's from the year 2000 when rap metal and this style of rapping were big.
p4554
aVI think it's an interesting collaboration and a good song overall, though I wish it were a little bit longer! It's not my favourite song from the album but I still enjoy it. Even though I loved WT's symphonic metal style, I think it's good that they're experimenting and keeping things fresh.
p4555

p4558
aVIt's the only song in the world with rap in it that I like, so that's something. I just wish Sharon had a bigger part in the song, after all it *is* her band.
p4559
aVI don't like rapping, and I never did. At first I didn't like this song because of it, but as I kept listening to the album with it popping up, I grew to actually like it. I still don't listen to rap except for this. 
p4560
aVI like the song... I have it on repeat, but I do agree with one redditor in that it was kind of generic. \u000a\u000aI do like a LOT of his work, but I think he could have definitely brought more to this track.
p4561
aVI love it. I've been a fan of WT for over 5 years, and it's been impressive to see how they can change and flexible they can be while still retaining the heart and soul that they started with. It's different, but god damn it makes me feel good.
p4562
aVI've been a fan for about 6 years as well and these last two albums have really disappointed me. There were two or three tracks I liked on Hydra. Sure their blending of musical styles still stays true to their style, but I don't like pop and rap as a general rule of thumb and with a few exceptions I don't like WT including this in their music. 
p4563
aVIt's OK, but Xzibit's rap parts are very generic and fairly lame.
p4564
aVI don't hate it, but it does grow on you after a few listens. After I got over the knee-jerk "what is this rap doing in my metal?" reaction, that is.
p4565
aVInitially I wasn't too keen, but after several listens I've got to say I'm enjoying it! It's certainly an interesting collaboration, almost like a beauty and the beast kind of thing going on. 
p4566
aVThis song was enjoyable for me, but the whole mix felt muted on it for some reason.  There was no pop to the instruments as there were in all of the other songs on the album.
p4567
aVIf I'm getting Hydra, I'd delete this song from my library. I don't like rapping, and Xzibit does not make it any better. This isn't NU metal...

p4571
aVSorry for that.
p4572
asVI feel Epica's song, "Martyr of the Free Word", is more relevant now than ever because of the shooting that happened at Charlie Hebdo.
p4573
(lp4574
VAgreed... Plus it's just a really cool song. :)\u000a\u000aOn another note, I wonder if Epica is on the Islamic extremists' hit list... they have a lot of songs that are critical of Islam... Most of TPA and some in TDC. Muslims have been posting comments on "Fools of Damnation" on YouTube saying that it's wrong to include the recordings of the tower-singing guy on the song, and that they think the song in general is not appropriate due to its subject matter. 
p4575
aVThey are critical of the idea of religion alltogether though, and not just Islam.
p4576
aVI'd agree they're mildly critical of religion in general, but the only song criticizing another specific religion that I can think of is "Living a Lie" (about Christianity). Even though Cry for the Moon criticized the Catholic church, it's exposing the corruption of the institution rather than the religion itself (inherently the religion is used to justify the institution) but the point is that Mark Jansen's lyrics, from the first two After Forever albums, almost the entirety of TPA and a couple times in TDC, all the way up to MaYaN's first album Quarterpast, Islam itself, the religion and the institution, has been criticized several times, going so far as to quote Muslim words/phrases. It's clear that Mark and probably the rest of the band have a lot more of a beef with Islam than they do with any other specific religion, just because in general it is more corrupt - as the song "Seif al Din" states: \u000a\u000a&gt;The rudiments have always been misinterpreted during history,\u000adespite the good intentions of many disciples who's faithful believe was strong and unswayed.\u000aMost leaders interpret the old words to their\u000aadvantage in the attempt of gaining leadership and power\u000aover those unfortunate enough to fall under their maliciousness and manipulative ways.\u000aThis misuse of trust will forever stain the pages of history,\u000aechoing the exploitation and the frailty of decent\u000amen carried away by nurtured rancour...
p4577
aVWhat tower-singing guy?
p4578
aVIn Islam there's a guy that goes up in a tower in predominantly Islamic towns/cities and sings the call to prayer five times a day. They recorded that for the end of the song "Living a Lie" and the beginning of "Fools of Damnation." 
p4579
aVOh. Had no idea about that. Interesting.
p4580
aVIt's called [Adhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan). A bit like ringing bells before a mass in a Church, but it's done five times a day.

aVI was wondering why you'd call the azan an 'adhan' and then I saw the bot's comment, lol.
p4583
aVI couldn't figure out how to spell it in latin letters, so I went with Wikipedia's way :)
p4584
aVHoly crap, you're right. I honestly didn't think that people would be so picky as to find it offensive like that.
p4585
aVWell, as you can see, Muslims can be pretty picky, and as I explained in a later reply, Mark (Epica's founder) has seemed to have been obsessed with criticizing Islam, from his first album in 1999/2000 all the way to Quarterpast in 2011. I think this is a pretty brave thing to do to get song ideas, but there's a good chance there are Muslims somewhere who think the band should be punished (AKA dead) for this. 
p4586
aVI thought of this song as well. The band shared it in response to the attack on their Facebook, I think.
p4587

p4597
aVYeah, Epica's music videos are usually somewhat awkward. They do love their weird revenge motifs.

aVTHIS
p4604
aVIt's a good video, a lot more vivid than Storm the Sorrow. Although I would have liked a longer song. If Epica had like Michael Bay levels of budget I have all these images and ideas for an amazing looking Natural Corruption music video in my head but I can't make it a reality lol. 
p4605
aVI maintain that the Unchain Utopia video really should've been set to that Star Trek: Into Darkness sequence where the Enterprise was falling down to Earth...\u000a\u000a&gt;we're in a time where all [E]nterprises fall...
p4606
aVWould have picked a different song from TQE but still cool!
p4607
aVThey did a sort of fan vote for this on Facebook and I think this song was suggested quite a lot. I was hoping for Natural Corruption or Chemical Insomnia!
p4608
aVOh, I was dying for a Chemical Insomnia video. It was the perfect song for a video. It has such cinematic feel to it, especially if they added a brief piece of the Fifth Guardian. 
p4609
aVPersonally I would've loved to see Sense Without Sanity as a video, but this is still pretty good.

sVHas Nightwish ever played with a live orchestra?
p4627
(lp4628
VI don't think they have, when they do, I'll do anything to be at that show.  ANYTHING.  
p4629
aVAny reason why they haven't?\u000a\u000aFor it to go this long without, I would imagine someone in the band doesn't want to, which is stupid because Within Temptation's Black Symphony is like the best thing to ever happen in music, I'm sure every Nightwish and Symphonic Metal fan would kill to see them with a live orchestra.
p4630
aVTuomas's dream is to do a live orchestra concert in London (particularly the Royal Albert Hall), using the same orchestra that the band have worked with since Once. Since time and money have prevented them from doing that (e.g. for Imaginaerum they put everything into the movie instead) it hasn't been realised yet.\u000a\u000aThe other thing the band have said about it is that they now see it as something all the big bands in the genre have done, and they don't want to do it unless they can do it in an original way. Personally I'd be totally happy to just see them playing their songs with an orchestra and no additional gimmicks, but I can see why they'd say that.
p4631
aVI guess it's kinda hard to plan something like that when you keep losing singers. I know I'm exaggerating, but you have to think Tuomas' next goal is for an orchestral concert, especially with the success he had with his solo album. Anette was a bit of a diva to the NW guys, so maybe Floor's consistency will make it possible to do something a bit more extravagant.
p4632
aVTherion has changed vocalists a dozen times and still did a number of concerts with a full orchestra. Tarja is performing with choirs and orchestras in her solo career. It can't be the singers.
p4633
aVBut the difference between Therion and Nightwish is that every time Nightwish has gotten a new singer (I know it's only twice, but bare with me), they've been drastically different from the previous singer. There's a huge adjustment period, and Anette was only just finding her place in the band when she left.\u000a\u000aThe very depressing truth could be that NW just can't afford it. From what I've seen, Tuomas is a very driven and determined perfectionist. He most likely wants to perform with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, have a full backing choir, rehearse with them extensively, record the show for a video release, choose a long setlist, and probably bring some guest musicians too. After just having spent a huge amount of money on a feature film, maybe they just can't afford it right now. 
p4634
aVanette never found her place live. She was often flat, and just not able to tour.
p4635
aVAll the symphonic metal concerts I have been to are at places with stages that aren't big enough for an orchestra. I have only seen north american concerts though. They do take up quite a bit of room. Maybe if they became super popular and could get enough people to fill a larger place they might try to get the orchestra too. I highly doubt that's doable.\u000a\u000aAlso it would cost a lot more money to have so many more people and you would have to find enough musicians willing to go on tour.  
p4636
aVIt wouldn't be a tour, it would be a single show the same way Within Temptation or Metallica have done it.
p4637
aVNightwish play huge venues in Europe - the Hartwall Arena where they've played in Finland holds 13,000 people. But Tuomas has said that he'd love to do an orchestra show in the Royal Albert Hall in London which holds more like 5000 people. As /u/screampuff said it would be a one-off show rather than a tour.

aVThey don't use any symphonic elements in their music (no orchestras, no choirs, no operatic singing), and they don't seem to take any inspiration from classical music or film scores. Those are the main things I use to identify a symphonic band. I guess the closest way to describe them would be melodic death metal with electronic/pop elements.

aVSeventeen years of mostly good to great stuff and you still have no faith in Tuomas' writing?!
p4762
aVThat's exactly why I'm afraid. There is no BAD song from Tuomas yet, and its bound to happen someday :/\u000a\u000aThe album is gonna be great, I know that, but what if ... I'M SCARED DUDE.
p4763
aVHaven't they recently announced their cooperation with Richard Dawkins? Now I'm scared too. 
p4764
aVBack in 2007 when After Forever appeared to be breaking up and Nightwish still hadn't announced their new vocalist, I was really hoping to see Floor Jansen with Nightwish. When it finally happened five years later I was so excited. And now you're making me worried that the first album with Floor won't be the best thing ever in the history of the universe... I'M GETTING SCARED TOO.
p4765
aVI don't really think it'll be anything like Epica. It will be Tuomas's style, but with a theme of (I guess) nature and evolution. We've been theorising that it's based on the book The Magic of Reality, which focuses on how science can be beautiful and amazing. I think the lyrics will be just as poetic as ever.\u000a\u000aI would say that Epica are much more political - the only nature songs I can think of that they've done are about things like oil spills and animals dying out, and how we should prevent those things from happening. So I think this will be very different.
p4766
aVEpica has an obsession with Deepak Chopra's version of quantum mechanics...
p4767
aVI wouldn't mind that honestly.\u000a\u000aSounds like something different and refreshing for Nightwish, and considering how Tuomas composes and writes, I expect it to be very different from Epica's stuff, even if some of the core ideas and concepts are similar.
p4768
aVI going to say this: Nightwish needs to update their branding. The "logo" is really old, tired and TBH amatuer looking now. It really doesn't match how much more professional they are compared to 1997 and how much they've grown. This shirt looks like it's got a great graphic theme, but the logo just kills it for me.
p4769
aVI imagine they keep it because it's all about having a consistent brand. Their logo is iconic and instantly recognisable now. I make images with band stuff and it's frustrating if a band has had 5 different logos... I often see Within Temptation's old logos getting used on official festival posters and things like that.

p4821
(lp4822
VThere are many more bands within the genre, but you have mentioned most of the big ones. There are three bands I am surprised you have not listed, because they are huge in the scene. In random order:\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp; \u000a\u000a1 - **Therion**\u000a\u000aThis band can be considered the original symphonic metal band. They started out as a late 80's death metal group, but introduced keyboards and gradually more symphonic elements in the early '90's. Their album *Theli* was incredibly influential for the whole of symphonic metal and contains one of their best tracks, [To Mega Therion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdTVNbDT_8M). \u000a\u000aMy favourite albums are *Live Gothic* and *Secret of the Runes*, most fans consider *Lemuria* and *Sirius B* to be their best work. Therion has produced [a number of great songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq4HZV_UTs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m10s) and albums, but also a few rotten apples.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp; \u000a\u000a2 - **Leaves' Eyes**\u000a\u000aFrontwoman Liv Kristine used to be the vocalist for Theatre of Tragedy, the band which developed 'Beauty and the Beast lyrics' (the exchange between harsh male and operatic female vocals). After departing from Theatre of Tragedy she joined forces with Atrocity to form Leaves' Eyes. \u000a\u000aMy favourite albums are *Symphonies of the Night*, *Njord* and *Vinland Saga*.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp; \u000a\u000a3 - **Delain**\u000a\u000aCreated by the former keyboardist for Within Temptation and frequently featuring guest vocals by Nightwish's Marco Hietala. Delain is on the mainstream end of the spectrum for symphonic metal: catchy tunes and understandable lyrics. No 15-minute epics, operatic vocals, or obscure texts in dead languages here. Still some very enjoyable stuff.\u000a\u000aMy favourite albums are *The Human Contradiction* and *Lucidity*.\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp; \u000a\u000aThere are of course a great many smaller symphonic metal bands, but only one of these would I recommend without any reservations:\u000a\u000a&amp;nbsp; \u000a\u000a4 - **ReVamp**\u000a\u000aFloor Jansen's project since the disbanding of After Forever. Both albums produced so far are great.
p4823
aVAll of these are excellent, but I personally don't like Delain as much as the others. I'm just not a fan of her voice and think the songs are a little too simple for me. Still worth a try though.
p4824
aVDelain is different from most other symph singers, she is trained classically and in Jazz, while most other trained vocalists come from operatic stock.\u000a\u000a\u000aTheir songs are more focused on feelings and relatable situations, rather than more fantastical verses. A number of their songs use metaphors and vivid imagery though
p4825
aVI'm very disappointed in myself for not trying out Delain until now...\u000a\u000aI just listened to Lucidity, and enjoyed it a lot.\u000aI then moved onto April Rain, and the very first time I heard the title track (April Rain) I fell in love like I haven't with a song in a while...definitely love Delain so far. Her voice during the chorus of that song in particular is so amazing sounding.
p4826
aVIf you enjoy Delain, Within Temptation style of music, check out Winter In Eden. Very similar.
p4827
aVVery informative and detailed answer, thanks for the background info on the bands. As I stated in other comments, I will definitely check out Therion at this point. \u000a\u000aLeaves' Eyes is one that I've heard of once or twice, but had no previous inclination to try out until now.\u000a\u000aDelain, on the other hand, has been #1 on my list of "curious to try out" bands for months now, but I've been so focused on other bands that I never did just yet. Definitely will now. Same goes for ReVamp.
p4828
aVTurisas is one I'm really into at the moment. \u000a\u000aGive 'Cursed be Iron' or 'Miklagard Overture a listen'. 
p4829
aVYay, finally someone else raising the Turisas torch high! Miklagard Overture is especially awesome if you've ever been to Istanbul - the lyrics are pretty much spot on in its description of the city and its surroundings.
p4830
aVTursias is one that I have never once heard of yet, but I'll definitely check out now that I have their name.
p4831
aVSonata Artica are a good band, their songs are hit and miss, some being very good, others more forgettable. Their singer Tony kakko is amazing live, a very passionate singer. \u000a\u000aAncient Bards are good.\u000a\u000a\u000aFor something different, look up Northern Kings\u000a\u000a\u000aFor something very different, try Van Canto
p4832
aVSonata Arctica, I'm only familiar with 1 song by them, "Don't Say a Word" from Reckoning Night. I've listened to all of Reckoning Night once, and I wasn't disappointed, but haven't gone back to try it out again, but I will now.\u000a\u000aAncient Bards, never heard of them, but will remember them now. \u000a\u000aNorthern Kings, I've heard of, because I absolutely love Marco Hietala. Just haven't tried them out yet.\u000a\u000aVan Canto, I've heard of, because of their cover of Wishmaster by Nightwish.
p4833
aV[Sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObI4XuTR2o)\u000a\u000a\u000a[Ancient Bards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeszIVnvo6o)\u000a\u000a\u000a[Yes, this is what it says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANrzPea6NiA)  but everything they did [has that initial reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGmhDLnWhOY)\u000a\u000a\u000aWishmaster by Van Canto is famous for the wrong reasons, heres a [medely they did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aeaz4s7q0Ag)\u000a
p4834
aVAlso, not only are Sonata Arctica awesome live, they are some of the nicest individuals I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.  I had a great experience when I met with them back in 2008 when Tony had gifted me with a piece of history from the tour.\u000a\u000aAfter shows, they would drive these remote control cars around the parking lots of the venues.  Tony's was this beat up yellow Chevrolet Corvette.  As our city was the last stop on the U.S. Tour, he came out of the bus with his car and asked those of us who were there for a meet and greet why he should give this car to one of us.  He gave it to me because I had brought my History binder out for them to sign (I had nothing else on me that was signable as it was all black).  He said that he admires education and most of all history, and gave me the car to keep.  He told me I should sell it because it would be worth a bit on eBay.  I told him I wouldn't sell it.  I never did.  It sits in my study now, and I look at it every time I feel like I'm about to quit school or work, or anything else.  I'm currently in my master's program for Secondary Education, with plans to graduate Summa Cum Laude in 2015 or 2016.  When the going gets tough, I look at that car and remember what I am doing, and what my personal goals are.\u000a\u000aI showed a picture of the same race car to him last week during a meet and greet before a concert, and he said "Holy shit, look at that!  I remember you!  How is your schooling going?"  He passed the phone down to the other members who were there and would have remembered (They have replaced their bassist since my last encounter).   It was really heart-warming to be remembered by these guys.\u000a\u000aOh, and for proof, I will upload the pics in a few hours when I am finished at work.
p4835
aVTherion is in my opinion almost an obligatory pick. You may also want to try Blind Guardian or Haggard. 
p4836
aVSee above for my response to Therion/Blind Guardian.\u000a\u000aHaggard, though, I actually have downloaded some of, but haven't gotten around to listening to yet.
p4837
aVTo echo what others have suggested: Therion, Leaves' Eyes, Blind Guardian (later stuff for more symph sound) and ReVamp. I would also say give Diabulus in Musica a listen. Their last album was pretty good. You may also want to try Coronatus. They have two singers with different styles, so they're unique in that way.   \u000a\u000aEdit: also check out Serenity, if you like Kamelot
p4838
aVTherion is one of the big names that I've heard time and time again, but never tried out. I'll be sure to now :)\u000a\u000aBlind Guardian, I am into a bit, I didn't include them on the list because I only knew of them as Power Metal, not really Symph. Only listened to A Twist in the Myth, though.\u000a\u000aReVamp, also on my list, because Floor Jansen is arguably my favorite female artist in the genre.\u000a\u000aDiabulus in Musica, never heard of them, but will remember them. Same for Coronatus.\u000a\u000aSerenity, I have on my list already, actually. Fallen Sanctuary is quite easily in my top 5 favorite albums of all time, specifically Coldness Kills is one of my top favorite songs. 
p4839
aVTuomas's Life And Times of Scrooge album is brilliant, if you haven't heard it yet.\u000a\u000aIf you get through all these suggestions, you could have a look through my A-Z of Symphonic Metal in the sidebar. Enjoy!
p4840
aVI actually do have it purchased in real life, but haven't listened to it yet.\u000a\u000aThe A-Z guide looks really awesome and well put together, I'll definitely get usage out of it :)

sVWhy isn't Hydra talked about more?
p4846
(lp4847
VFor one, just because the reviews pass something flying colors doesn't mean that the public will feel the same. Critics are people not an entire society. There are countless movies that are praised by critics but hated by audiences and visa versa. If you like it, then fine. However, I wouldn't shield behind critics too much. While we rely on critics to give up an idea of what a product is like in order to inform us on whether something is worth our money; somethings they just don't know what they are talking about. It's best to create your own opinion as best as you can by yourself after you've experienced something. \u000a\u000aI, for one, think Hydra wasn't that great of an album. It's no Mother Earth or The Heart of Everything. Two of their albums in which I absolutely love. Hydra, to me, lacks identity. Nothing in it states it's a Within Temptation piece. There wasn't any style using motives, rifts, cadences, etc. that makes my brain light up and go "oh it's Within Temptation!" If anything Hydra feels like it's someone else's album. Everything felt like such a big departure. If I had to call it anything it felt a bit "safe". They had a style going and it seems like they want to abandon it. Perhaps to make themselves more appealing beyond the metal audience? If so then that would explain "And We Run" and the cover of "Radioactive". Two song of which boggle my mind on why they even exist in this album. However, I do not know Within Temptation motives for the future or their roadmap. All I know is that I did not end up enjoying this album. Hopefully, I will have better feelings towards their next album. 
p4848
aVAll their covers are from the Q Sessions. They're not songs on Hydra. And I don't think you understand what "safe" means. Safe means doing something familiar.
p4849
aVThe special edition of Hydra included a bunch of the covers, that might be what they're thinking of. I believe the covers were done as a promo for that radio station because they sponsored Elements.
p4850
aVI'll give you the Q Sessions. I honestly didn't know. I'm not the biggest follower of Within Temptation. Really, I didn't even know about Hydra until I saw it on the rack at F.Y.E.\u000a\u000aThe reason I put safe in quotes is mainly because I couldn't find a word that fits what I'm trying to say. If safe means an artist isn't pushing the envelope and see how they can develop their craft, then Hydra wasn't even in the envelope. To me, Within Temptation took everything out of the envelope and stuck it in a new one. Pretty much to a point where you might as well have slapped a new band name on the cover. 
p4851
aVThey have many Symphonic Metal songs on the album. Don't let a featured rapper on a song make you hate it.
p4852
aVI'm not saying the songs in the album weren't by definition symphonic metal. Nor is the album not symphonic metal. Everything is symphonic metal. However, the style doesn't feel like Within Temptation. Instead the style feels like it belongs to someone else's symphonic metal band. It's a style that I frankly don't enjoy and is the reason why I didn't end up liking the album. It wasn't the rapper who did the entire album in. Though, the rapper did kill the entire song, but that's because I can't stand Rap.  
p4853
aVSo is this what this Subreddit has become? Bands change over time and everyone here wants them to stay the same
p4854
aVPersonally, I don't browse /r/symphonicmetal enough to know the community that well. So I can't tell you about the subreddit like that. \u000a\u000aChange is inevitable with an artist. Change in an artist can either happen gradually or abruptly. When you change gradually then no one is going to notice overall. Take Nightwish for example. Élan still sounds like a Nightwish song. However, compare it to any song from Angels Fall First and the style sounds similar but different. That's because the style has matured. If you change abruptly, then any artist must know doing that you will polarize your fanbase. There's no way around it, it's just inevitable. For here you can even go with Nightwish again. When Tarja was kicked out and Anette came in, the fanbase was completely split. Even to this day you will find Tarja only fans who have dropped out of listening to Nightwish. You will also find the fans who will follow Nightwish to the ends of the Earth. \u000a\u000aIn regards to Within Temptation, if Hydra is the style they are going with from now on and not the style that was found in Mother Earth, then so be it. It's their decision. However, whether I will like it or not is to be determined. I look forward to the new album and see were things go. If I don't like where Within Temptation is going, then I won't buy their albums and I'll leave gracefully. I don't kick or whine like a child. I move on and look for other material that I enjoy. What I have stated here were my reason why I did not enjoy Hydra. I tried to the best of my abilities at 1AM to explain that. If by any means I came across as demanding that Within Temptation cater to me and me only, then I'm sorry. 
p4855
aVTheir precious album is very similar to many songs on this one. It's not like this came out of nowhere.
p4856
aVYou're not even reading what he's trying to tell you. He's not looking for reasons for him to like this album. He's just explaining his point of view.
p4857
aVI read it
p4858
aVUnless I'm missing something, most of the reviews for Hydra were between 3.5/5 and 4/5, which I don't read as "incredible". Hydra wasn't*bad by any means, but it wasn't particularly good either. The lack of a unifying sound really hurt the album in my view, making it sound more like a string of would-be singles than a proper album, which is ironic because the singles from the album were some of the weakest, in my view. It was a decent record by pop metal standards, but there's nothing on the album that made me think "that was amazing". Within Temptation's always had a 'mainstream' type of sound which appeals more to people who wouldn't usually listen to metal, and Hydra's the album where this is most clear. The symphonic elements were pretty weak and most songs relied heavily on Sharon's vocals to drive them, (which isn't really a good thing in metal, and the gimmick of having guest vocals only works well on one track with the others either sounding out-of-place or simply boring. Overall, there are a few good tracks on the album and no tracks that stand out as bad, but there's nothing that stands out on this album so it's been mostly forgotten.
p4859
aVjust a personal view and nothing more but.....\u000a\u000aHydra was a sell out album for me. They didn't so much experiment with their sound to keep fresh as change it to a mainstream poppy sound to try and break the US and UK. totally fine direction for the band to go in if that's what they want but it just didnt do it for me.\u000a\u000aI fell in love with mother earth and onwards, I brought the silent force tour dvd and I saw them live when they were touring the heart of everything. I was a fan.  personally though I consider hydra to be the worst purchase I made in 2014, reviews be damned.
p4860
aVI've always felt that Hydra is a very weird album.\u000a\u000aWithin Temptation is one of my favorite bands and Hydra has certainly grown on me to the point where I listen to it more regularly than I did when it first came out. I think there are some great tracks on the album (Paradise, Silver Moonlight, Covered by Roses, Tell Me Why). But it also has some of my least favorite WT tracks (Dog Days, The Whole World is Watching). The rest of the tracks feel fairly "middle of the road" for me. Every other WT album I can listen to beginning to end without skipping a track. With Hydra, I'm more likely to skip tracks to get to the ones I like.\u000a\u000aThere are too many guest appearances - they're no strangers to having guests on their albums, but with four out of the ten songs having guest vocalists, it felt kind of overboard.\u000a\u000aI recently got the Let Us Burn live BluRay/CD set, and, at least for the Hydra show, many of the songs worked better live, so that has certainly given me a slightly newer perspective on Hydra - for instance, I hate the album version of The Whole World is Watching, but the live acoustic version is actually quite nice.\u000a\u000aIt's not a bad album, by any stretch of the imagination, but I can't call it incredible - just weird.
p4861
aVDog Days is a terrific track. Keep listening. The Whole World Is Watching is one I passed on as well, but get the one without the guy from Soul Asylum and it's much better.\u000a\u000aI mean that last track especially is much more poppish, but I like WT and I am not so close minded as to dislike a song because it's not a certain genre.\u000a\u000aI would love to hear that Blu-ray, though I think the sound quality on Hydra is top notch. I wish they'd rerecord or remaster their early stuff.\u000a\u000aThank you for your kind(er) words than most here! :)
p4862
aVI've listened to Dog Days many times. I don't like it.\u000a\u000aI've heard both versions of The Whole World is Watching, and the one without Dave Pirner is certainly...better...I guess. I still don't like that song. For me, Tell Me Why is where the album ends.\u000a\u000aThe reason I don't like the song isn't because it's not a part of the genre or whatever and it's certainly not due to any sort of "closed mindedness". I think it's a boring song, regardless of the genre.\u000a\u000aWT has done the whole ballad-esque thing far better when you listen to songs like All I Need or Memories or even Fire And Ice. The Whole World is Watching, to my ears, pales greatly by comparison.
p4863
aVI guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. But if you don't like Dog Days then I doubt we have similar taste in music. But I will say, Within Temptation never sounded more mature and sure of themselves, with tighter songwriting and melodies, than on Hydra. If all their fans on here don't like their evolution and branching out then I'll have to just leave it behind. But the sales and reviews certainly side with me.
p4864
aVFor me, the only really good songs on the album are Silver Moonlight and Covered by Roses. The Unforgiving took me time to get used to but eventually I really started to appreciate and love it, but Hydra is a resounding "meh". I don't mind that they change their style, but I don't think they were able to pull it off properly. Several songs feel like total filler (Let Us Burn, Edge of the World, Whole World is Watching), and while I like that they explored something new with And We Run, they really lacked the creative spark. 
p4865
aVOnce, Within Temptation was one of my favorite bands, but they drifted more and more into the main stream music. I miss their unique character of old times. With the last two albums they put themselves side by side with pop music artists and created rather run-of-the-mill music. All my friends who liked WT feel alike. What has made WT unique and special seems to be gone :(
p4866
aVI'd have to agree here. Pretty much everything before The Unforgiving was great to me. Excellent stuff. Had a nice range of soft and hard songs. Of the their last two albums the only song I've really listened to consistently was 'Covered By Roses' because it didn't sound like... Everything else. Black Symphony is where I see their high-point. 
p4867
aVI think it was a great album, but wasn't memorable. For me anyway. It just didn't have anything special about it to make it stand out. That being said, I still listen to it from time to time because it is enjoyable enough.
p4868
aVWhen it came out there was definitely a lot of discussion here, but it wasn't received very positively. A lot of people loved the Paradise single but in general I feel people were disappointed with the album.\u000a\u000aPersonally I enjoy Hydra, but I would still rank it among my least favourite WT albums. I think the whole idea of the Hydra is that they would show their different "heads" by making different styles of song, but for me this created an end result that wasn't very cohesive. There's some individual songs on there I love, but I don't entirely love the whole. I'm not bothered by then becoming more commercial and less metal - I mean, I grew to absolutely adore The Unforgiving. I'm looking forward to what they do next and hoping it will be something that grabs me a bit more.
p4869
aVSeriously... this subreddit is getting more and more full of hipsters by the day.  This album is great, but all of the comments say Hydra is too mainstream or it's not [insert previous album here].  Bands change, deal with it.  Personally, this album is well within the realm of Within Temptation's sound, and it's fantastic.  As for the rest of their albums, each one has a unique sound to me, but all different from each other.  To say this album is bad because it's a departure from their previous sound is pretty hypocritical. \u000a\u000a\u000aPeople are going to complain that it's not symphonic *metal*, but even Sharon admitted they are a symphonic *rock* band.  Stop putting labels on stuff and shunning it for labels.  You know who else did that? Hitler.
p4870
aVThank you for these comments. You worded everything better than I could.
p4871
aVThe songs are catchy and great for live, but it's not symphonic metal anymore. I think they deserve their "mainstream" success, they worked very hard for it.
p4872
aVIf you do a search here, I think you'll find it wasn't well reviewed. We are fans of symphonic metal. I don't think Hydra was cleanly in the SM genre. I'm sure if I listened to it for a while in the car I could find something to like, but it's not my music.
p4873
aVIt's this attitude that keeps me from staying around this subreddit. Way, way too elitist.
p4874
aVIt's not elitist IMO, we just like hearing what we like. I've listed to albums and disliked them at first only to fall in love. I can also listen to stuff that isn't purely symphonic. I like a lot of WT's more recent albums. I just can't get into Hydra.

VI'm having a good time with it. I'm not great at puzzle platformers, but the gameplay is pretty straightforward and easy to pick up. The environments are very pretty, and of course, the soundtrack is great. It's always fun recognizing the various vocalists.\u000a\u000aIt's about what I was expecting. Their Kickstarter didn't reach its goal, but they still delivered a pretty decent game that they've been patching regularly. They seem serious about making improvements and getting the bugs ironed out.\u000a\u000aThe thing that bugged me the most was that the intro seemed kinda phoned-in compared with the rest of the game. The white sketchy look over the purple/blue gradient looks kinda crappy compared with how beautiful the actual game is. Really wish they would have kicked up the production quality of that a few notches (or at least give players the option to skip past this part).\u000a\u000aAnd yeah, to your third point, the game seems more of a resource hog than it should be. It's enough to make my GPU fan run constantly, which only really happens with monsters like Dragon Age and a heavily modded Skyrim. 
p4898
aVTotally agreed. I wish I could remap the shift keys! At least I can move around with the arrow keys. Hoping Act II improves it significantly.
p4899
aVI gave money to it when it was on Kickstarter, and they have delivered well. But it's very buggy. Like unplayable buggy. I'd say wait a little while longer while they are still patching it. What I've heard of the soundtrack is fabulous and the (intended) game is very solid.
p4900

VHonestly, for most of my friends, they like Epica up until Mark comes in with the growling. I personally don't mind him at all, but I do prefer Simone most of the time. 
p4910
aVHe sounds like Cookie Monster.
p4911
aVHaha... I guess it did take me a while to get into the growling... but now I love it and growl along. Just an acquired musical taste I guess. 
p4912
aVFor me, the issue is not the growling itself, but rather Mark doing it. I don't really like his style and I think there is a disparity in overall vocal skill between Simone and him (as long as comparing female and male vocalist makes any sense to you). 
p4913
aVIn my opinion Mark has some of the best growls out there... Especially on songs like The Obsessive Devotion. 
p4914
aVI like Mark's growls, but I don't think they're the best; they could be better and, in my opinion, a little more deep. I'm more a fan of Mikael Åkerfeldt's harsh vocals from Opeth, although his harsh vocals are fickle (especially now). Examples: [1](http://youtu.be/X1sh8kt5dvo?t=21s) and [2](http://youtu.be/fT_waNzdKMg?t=1m17s).  \u000a\u000aHowever, I think Mark has the best harsh vocals in symphonic metal. I fucking love MaYaN. 
p4915
aVTo get any deeper than Mark on TDC you'd have to either be a stinking bear or use voice manipulation technology. Do you have a song by Opeth that gets deeper than Mark in The Obsessive Devotion for example? \u000a\u000a(Kudos for being a MaYaN fan! I couldn't get the growls for "Human Sacrifice" out of my head since it came out. Melody in Antagonise was not as strong as in Quarterpast but the drums and vocals and sheer heaviness were awesome.)
p4916
aVMark's grows are actually very bad in comparison to actual death metal growlers. I remember watching or reading an interview a loooong time ago where he mentioned that he's not a natural growler. 
p4917
aVI find that the growls (in all bands) are much more easier to appreciate once you know the lyrics. 
p4918
aVYeah... Though some like SepticFlesh's song "Mad Architect" I got addicted to it before I even had a clue what the growls were about. 
p4919
aVI think their voices and singing styles are different from each other in a way that complements them both.
p4920
aVThe growl is definitely an acquired taste. Personally, I only like it as long as it is complimenting clean vocals, like it is in Epica.
p4921
aVI'm one of these people.  I love epica as long as they stay away from the death growl.
p4922
aVIt's satanic, evil metal music for us heathens that burn our first-borns while chanting *Mein Kampf* inside a pentagram.\u000a\u000a...in other words, it's metal, and a lot of people don't like it, and some outright hate it. Throw in a female operatic singer, and it becomes a bit polarizing for a lot of metal fans, especially the modern metal fans and metalcore fans. Don't worry too much about it. Think about how much shit the people on /r/BABYMETAL must get.
p4923
aV&gt; Throw in a female operatic singer, and it becomes a bit polarizing for a lot of metal fans, especially the modern metal fans and metalcore fans.\u000a\u000aSmack these idiots accross the face with some old-school Nightwish.
p4924
aVHa, you would think that the operatic vocals and orchestral elements would make it seem less evil to those who think metal is satanic... 
p4925
aVI come from the opposite end of the spectrum, I grew up listening to classical music and the classical elements was actually what attracted me to this genre. For me, the female operatic vocals and orchestration are what make things work. It's like the devil fighting the angel, it's the perfect balance.\u000a
p4926
aVHa... that's where I came from too! Classically trained pianist and composer... now learning 7-string electric guitar due to Epica. I don't really see a "fight" going on in their music, but there is definitely a yin/yang element which is very pleasing once you've gotten used to it. \u000a\u000aI bet you will really like the song [Beethoven's Nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTShSv-95uI) by Dragonland... It was my first metal song except for the classical covers from Epica's Classical Conspiracy and I found it awesome how they weaved Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in and out of the music. 
p4927
aVI usually only prefer bands with female lead singers, but I love that Dragonland song. It actually reminds me of [The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7av8HmlfECs) by Dark Moor (the name of the song is awful lol). It's more like the Moonlight Sonata being mashed together with the 5th Symphony and turned into a power metal song...which coming from the classical world, was a bit strange at first but I love it now.  \u000a\u000aMy first taste of metal was actually from Metallica's S&amp;M album, that made me go on to youtube to look for their videos and someone posted a video that supposed to be them playing the Imperial March (it was terrible and no one actually thought it was them playing), someone in the comment mentioned "Epica played this much better!"....more youtube searches later and I got into this rabbit hole. :-)
p4928
aV&gt; Someone in the comment mentioned "Epica played this much better!"\u000a\u000aHow long ago was this? Could have been me who posted it! \u000a\u000aDark Moor is awesome... At least for the albums Gates of Oblivion and Hall of the Olden Dreams (haven't listened to the others much). I wished so badly that they had a real orchestra for their version of Mozart's Dies Irae (well, more like song borrowing bits and pieces of the Requiem).  Same thing with Symphony X's Oddyssey. If the orchestra was real it would be 10x better... even though it's already like their best song. Back to DM... The song "The Fall of Melnibone" is one of their best but doesn't appear on any of the main albums. I can only find it on YouTube. 
p4929
aVI think what he means to say is that other metal people don't like it as much. I have a friend who's liked Fleshgod Apocalypse less and less with each subsequent album because they've added in more and more of those elements with each release.
p4930
aV&gt; Throw in a female operatic singer, and it becomes a bit polarizing for a lot of metal fans, \u000a\u000ayou mean, symphonic metal in general
p4931
aVEpica seems relatively unknown outside of the genre from what I've seen. Everyone I've mentioned them to either already loves them or never heard of them.
p4932
aVEh, that was the case with some people... but so far my luck has been to find a few people who know about them who either think that they're "gothic" or "terrible" or "OK for what they are." Of course there was a bit of the gothicness as part of their image early on (e.g. Phantom Agony music vid) but there are far more elements to their style like classical, soundtrack-like and quality music, with a lack of "depressing" topics/riffs to fairly call them a gothic band... I guess the operatic vocals could be a part of why a lot of metalheads don't like them but IDK. 
p4933
aVWell, for a starter it's death metal, and that's a big red flag in itself for many people. Regardless of it being melodic and symphonic (which has it's own effects), it has heavy riffs, distorted guitars, unusual rhythms, double kicks, solos/shredding, death growls, and overall is generally super theatrical, dramatic and intense to listen to. This will turn a large percentage away in itself. \u000a\u000aOther metal-heads I know rather enjoy it mostly, but there are some that find the theatrical/dramatic side of them to be a little too much similar to bands like Dimmu Borgir. They can usually appreciate the musical capabilities and achievements of Epica, but just find it's not really for them.\u000a\u000aThere is another large group, particularly South Americans that consider Epica, namely Simone Simons, to be racist. I'm baffled as to how they're so sure of this to the point where they make public hate pages against her and Epica. I've seen a couple of explanations and [videos as 'proof'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r9Zzctk7i8) saying she is apprehensive to let fans touch her and especially touch her hair at signings after shows etc. Considering how touchy feely South Americans are (as a cultural thing) I somewhat understand how they might think that, but it's totally unfair, I don't like people touching me and I'm not even famous. Personal space needs to be respected, especially when requested.\u000a\u000aAnother group of haters are religious groups (Muslims mostly) that hate on Epica because of their stance on free speech, religion etc. They have a song [Fools of Damnation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csYBwZPCleY) that receives a lot of hate from the Muslim community (those who know about it anyway), usually for the Arabic chant/melody they include in the beggining and throughout coupled with the lyrical theme about praying/kneeling/religions being foolish etc.\u000a\u000aThere are also those that claim Simone Simons is a "diva" and that she's not as pretty as everyone makes out (she's mega beautiful, how the fuck?!), and that she's up herself with her blogs and her appearance on stage, she brings the dignity of the band down, she's a terrible singer, a Tarja wannabe etc. Ridiculous.\u000a\u000aSo yeah, they definitely receive a lot of hate from quite a few different channels, but ya know what? I don't give a shit because fuck them, their opinions are fucking stupid, they don't make sense, they're just another bunch of crying babies pretending to be more offended ~~that~~ than they really are and fuck religion (especially Islam).
p4934
aV&gt; Well, for a starter it's death metal, and that's a big red flag in itself for many people. Regardless of it being melodic and symphonic (which has it's own effects), it has heavy riffs, distorted guitars, unusual rhythms, double kicks, solos/shredding, death growls, and overall is generally super theatrical, dramatic and intense to listen to. This will turn a large percentage away in itself. \u000a\u000aInteresting notions. Calling Epica's music an actual death metal is perhaps a stretch, but you bring up a lot of good points that hasn't occurred to me before. Apart from anything else, this would partially explain why I'm not that much into this band.
p4935
aVWell, melodic death metal. I find them somewhat similar to the Swedish sort of death metal sound (Soilwork, Dark Tranquillity etc), rather than traditional death metal.
p4936
aVThey are not melodic death metal. They aren't even symphonic death metal.
p4937
aVPsst, this is the part where you actually contribute to the conversation and enlighten us all to what their true core genre might be. 
p4938
aVSymphonic Metal?
p4939
aVJust enough growls to be annoying for mainstream music fans, too few growls to be gratifying for hardcore death metal/screamo fans... just the right amount of growls for Epica fans! I think we're getting somewhere here. 
p4940
aVYeah, I don't really consider them strongly death metal either, except for some of their more recent work (the heavier DYU and TQE songs would kinda qualify).
p4941
aVDid you hear Stay the Course from RFTI... That was pretty much as close as they ever got to full on death metal... outside of Semblance of Liberty and the bonus track Incentive from DYU.
p4942
aVYeah. I think Martyr of the Free Word, Kingdom of Heaven and Victims of Contingency are more "death metal-y" than Stay the Course, but it definitely seemed to have some influence.
p4943
aVHa... someone who thinks Epica is death metal! You should hear Mark's band MaYaN. But yes I like the growls unlike a lot of people.\u000a\u000aRacist? My gosh! Those people were practically swarming her, she has every right to ask them politely to stop... I for one would probably not be so polite about it as I have a need for some personal space. If they thought she was racist, why do they think she sings concerts in their countries in the first place? I had never heard about this before, thanks for informing me. \u000a\u000aI guess I understand the religious nuts' point, but I side with Epica in the views posited in their songs. I think they're quite brave to write songs about Islam, especially considering what has happened to many who criticize the worst of the major religions. \u000a\u000aThe one reason I could see for people to not like Epica is that Simone's singing is often not up to par with her "album voice" ... probably because the concerts are so loud she can't hear herself. I don't know but Retrospect was a fiasco in this sense, and I'm a HUGE fan of Epica's music. When it comes down to it though most popular bands' singers are worse live than they are on the albums, and at least Simone has the guts to use her real voice instead of being auto-tuned like Justin Bieber or his ilk. \u000a\u000aNever heard of the racist thing before... thanks once again for comprehensive answer. 
p4944
aVThey're certainly a form of death metal, perhaps not extreme, traditional  or brutal, of course, but I find most of their songs have some strong melodic death metal elements to it. Like I said in the other comment think more Scandinavian/Swedish death metal like Soilwork, In Flames, Dark Tranquillity etc. If I was gonna be super picky and anal about what style I'd call them, it's probably be: Neo-Classical/Symphonic, Melodic and Gothic Death Metal.
p4945
aVI'd call them Symphonic Progressive Death Metal, post-TDC.
p4946
aVThat's more like MaYaN's label... Too many clean vocals and choirs in Epica to be Death metal... I think the growls have to be over 50% of the vocals before it's really DM... 
p4947
aVYeah, MaYaN are definitely symphonic progressive death metal. Epica have some bits of it, but not all that much.
p4948
aVYeah, Simone's voice isn't the most powerful, especially compared to people like Tarja or Floor, but she makes up for it with her versatility and her soft/"angelic" tone.
p4949
aVYeah...I wish I could hear Epica perform with Floor as the lead... She is usually a lot more on tune, but I agree that Simone's voice is the most angelic... Floor's is a lot more "dirty" if you know what I mean. 
p4950
aVIf Simone were to leave the band, I agree that Floor would be the best replacement (and it'd be in a way more reminiscent of early After Forever), but that would suck really bad.\u000a\u000aI'm really happy Floor is with Nightwish now, she's pretty much a perfect fit there.
p4951
aVDarn... I still haven't heard Floor in NW... Last I heard from her was in ReVamp... which is decent but not quite AF quality.

aVThis and the performance at [Wacken Open Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr9nbCdJZHg). Amazing!
p4956
aVRevamp isn't symphonic metal in the same vein as the rest. Revamp is prog metal. It shares more in common with dream theatre than after forever.
p4957
aVthe reason simone isn't like her album voice is she has no formal training for that style of singing. Her and Anette Olzen have a bad habit of being flat when they perform.
p4958
aVI'm trying to think what reactions towards them I've heard. Amongst symphonic metal fans, the vast majority love them or at least appreciate them to some extent (discounting trolls/people who think Simone is a diva etc). With general metal fans, they seem to have the gut reaction of "oh, it's a female singer and it's a bit operatic, I don't like it". I have successfully converted a few of those...\u000a\u000aI don't think I've ever met anyone who'd properly listened to them and decided they were bad, though. I did nearly get into an argument with someone on r/metal who said they were "tasteless" - apparently he/she meant they thought Epica didn't combine metal and classical in a tasteful way. At least that's more of a valid criticism than people who just say they're bad without any proper consideration.\u000a\u000aI've actually had a lot more negative reactions to me liking Nightwish and Within Temptation. Someone once stopped talking to me in a metal club when I said I liked Nightwish. And I used to know these two guys who (I was told) laughed at me behind my back because they thought I was stupid for enjoying WT. Sigh...

aVW-W-W-Within Temptation?!?! Heh... hehe... haha... You're entitled to your opinion but WITHIN TEMPTATION IS NOT METAL! But Nightwish is cool... especially Dark Chest of Wonders, Kinslayer etc. Then again, if you have any WT songs that are more hard-core than I'd be happy to listen to them. 
p4961
aVI don't see why it matters what genre they are. I don't only listen to metal. However I'm more inclined to believe the vast majority of people who do consider them to be symphonic metal (this sub is pretty good evidence for that) or at least symphonic rock, since that's what the band have labelled themselves. I would still love their music no matter what category people put them under.\u000a\u000aWith WT it's all about the epic feeling, the orchestration. Their latest album was more generic and although it had more songs with prominent guitars and some harsh vocals, people proclaimed it to be a more commercial record. When it comes to their previous albums, I've never heard any pop or rock that sounds at all close. Maybe try The Heart of Everything, but if you just go looking for how metal something is instead of the quality of the music, then you may be disappointed.
p4962
aVI like a lot of classical and soundtrack music too... but I listened to a couple of WT's albums (the first one and The Unforgiving) and thought the songs were quite repetitive. I can agree that there is a lot of good music outside of Metal though. I love Mozart's Requiem. 
p4963
aVAh, I would definitely suggest giving The Heart of Everything a go then - for me it's their best symphonic album. They might just not be for you, though. I mean there are plenty of bands that everyone loves that I just can't get into.
p4964
aVThanks... I'll see how it goes! 
p4965
aVDon't you think it's a little ironic that you're reacting to WT fans in the exact same manner that people react to you for liking Epica? While WT isn't an exemplary metal band, and while their music contains some of symphonic metal's biggest weaknesses at times, it's definitely still metal (other than The Unforgiving). Even the guys at Encyclopaedia Metallica think so, and they're incredibly elitist when it comes to accepting fringe bands as metal.
p4966
aVI'm not saying that what Epica criticizers are saying is ethically wrong or that people should not be able to criticize bands including Epica, I just wanted to know what the rationale for the dislike was so I could have better examples to give when someone says something vague like "they're terrible." \u000a\u000aWith Within Temptation, I have a few very specific criticisms - from what I've heard they don't have many heavy riffs, the songs are very repetitive, and the songwriting borders on "dark" pop many times. Actually though the Unforgiving was the main album I listened to so maybe I just dislike that one and their others are somewhat better. 
p4967
aVWithin Temptation's music differs considerably from album to album, listening mostly to The Unforgiving doesn't do them justice (especially as it's their most unusual album). The Heart of Everything and The Silent Force are pretty similar, both being typical symphonic gothic metal albums (I personally prefer THoE because there's more variation from song to song). The Unforgiving is "symphonic rock", although I'm not too sure about the symphonic part. Mother Earth is a surprisingly light album despite the metal elements threaded throughout the album. I couldn't get into Mother Earth despite several attempts, but the title track and Ice Queen are both definitely worth listening to. Hydra's a mix of their last three albums with a mainstream appeal (unsurprisingly it's kinda average).\u000a\u000aWhile I'd say your criticisms of Within Temptation are definitely valid, I don't think that necessarily makes their music *bad*. It certainly makes them less metal and less symphonic than others, and they're definitely not a band I would hold up as an example of what the genre can be at it's best. However, they're great if you want to just stop thinking and listen to some pop metal.\u000a\u000aCriticisms of Epica are largely in the same vein as those said about Within Temptation: their symphonic elements and their metal elements are both pretty good, but they're nothing special. What makes them a good band is the fusion of the two at the same time. If people don't like some of those elements (e.g. growling vocals) then they're not going to like Epica.
p4968
aVWT used to be Symphonic Metal. :(
p4969
aVTo give them credit, they still make some pretty good music (arguably better than their early stuff) and they used growls in their latest album, to my surprise.
p4970
aV&gt; they still make some pretty good music (arguably better than their early stuff)\u000a\u000aThen "[Stand My Ground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sCkAvh50Vs])" comes on and curb stomps anything they've made in this decade.\u000a\u000a"See Who I Am" plays and suddenly Sharon del Adel is demonstrating range.\u000a
p4971
aVHeh. I do like The Silent Force quite a bit, but not the first 2 albums.\u000a\u000aThe Heart of Everything was their best work though, I think, and it's also the album that got me into symphonic metal. There are some really great songs there.
p4972
aVI personally felt The Unforgiving was better, but their most symphonic song IMO did come in The Heart of Everything (The Truth Beneath the Rose, anyone?)
p4973
aVWow, somehow I own all their other albums and somehow haven't heard any of the original songs on The Heart of Everything!
p4974
aVSome people, myself included, love Epica's  music until the growling steps in the picture.  \u000aMany bands would be better off without growling **in my opinion**. To name a few: Epica, The Agonist, Amaranthe.  \u000aBut, I'm picky about my music and often receive hatred about it :-)
p4975
aVI don't really care for them. I'm a huge Nightwish and within temptation fan though.  
p4976
aVWithin Temptation... BAH HUMBUG. I am not a fan of them... Not heavy enough. XD\u000a\u000aNW on the other hand I can handle... still not as hard core as Epica though. 
p4977
aVWhaaaaat?!  That's crazy to me!  I haven't heard a whole lot from Epica but what I have heard, it just seems like a Nightwish copycat that can't quite catch the same magic that Nightwish have.  But perhaps I just haven't heard the right stuff.  Same might apply to you in regards to WT.  I'll come back later when I'm not on mobile and post something for you.  
p4978
aVThey are a Nightwish copycat, except in any way whatsoever.  Their music is more harsh.  The guitars/bass far more distorted.  Lyrically the two bands are worlds apart.  Nightwish has a lot of fantasy/emotional stuff while Epica tends to be politically/world event driven.\u000a\u000aIn fact, Epica has taken far more from Kamelot than Nightwish.  Shit, the band's name was Sahara Dust until Kamelot released their album "Epica."  And Epica's sound, if we have to say it is influenced by another band, is far closer to Kamelot's than Nightwish's.
p4979
aVIs that with fellow metalheads or "normies"?  I love epica personally.
p4980
aVMostly "normies"... Two other metalheads I showed it to thought the lyrics were amazing and thought the band was awesome... One former Epica fan though thinks they're too "gothic." I guess they're as gothic as the next metal band, but they haven't milked that audience for at least their last 4 albums. (I can see why "Mother of Light" and "The Phantom Agony" would have that vibe due to the lyrics but still... they don't flaunt gothicness the way bands like Lacuna Coil or WT or even Delain do, especially lately. 
p4981
aVI don't even know what "gothic" means anymore, considering how often it gets misused.\u000a\u000aTo me, gothic is Tristania, early (and most recent) Sirenia, Draconian, Theatre of Tragedy, etc.\u000a\u000aI never understood why so many people call bands like Epica, Nightwish and Within Temptation (apart from their first album) "gothic".
p4982
aVTo me, gothic is music with depressing lyrics and music... Epica's closest to gothic is probably Serenade of Self-Destruction followed by Mother of Light, which are both about suicide... Mother of Light is actually pretty determined and more "angry" than depressing though... the tune is awesome. SOSD is more sad/desperate sounding, but the overall intellectuality of the sentiment and the genius of the song takes it far beyond the realm of emo-gothicness. The rest of their work is generally more philosophical or political than something written to appeal to the gothic tastes of death, bleakness and depression. 
p4983
aVHuh, had no idea Mother of Light was about suicide. Serenade is a masterpiece though, and yeah, I don't really find it very depressing or nihilistic as much as an open-minded look at the topic and the validity/merit of suicide.
p4984
aVYeah... It's probably the best song on the topic I've ever heard, and in my opinion way less gothic than depressing "pop" songs like the one that goes "staring down the barrel of a .45" etc. Mother of Light was actually like the third Epica song I ever heard and I liked it months before I went full-out Epica fan. 
p4985
aVidunno, most metal heads I know like them, probably my favorite symphonic band, I actually like them quite a bit more than Nightwish
p4986
aVI think Epica makes great sounding music. Foobar shows 30 listens to TQE alone.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I think their lyrics are very weak in comparison with their sound. Victims of Contingency is especially noteworthy in this regard.\u000a\u000aI don't listen to them when I want to feel anything other than pumped up.
p4987
aVHuh, I never experienced this.  Some of my friends are metalheads, but they prefer older bands like Iron Maiden and Metallica, or in the case of one friend more folk metal like Eluveitie.  I seem to be the only one who prefers the more symphonic metal bands like Nightwish, Epica, Leaves' Eyes, and so on.\u000a\u000aMy friends don't really seem to have an opinion on Epica likely because they haven't listened to the band enough.  It's weird with my group of friends, we have two people who prefers old-style heavy metal, one who prefers more folk metal, and myself who prefers symphonic and power metal.
p4988
aVTook me a bit to get use to the growls. But,  musically love them. Cant wait to see them again
p4989
aVFrom my own experiences, I have heard mostly negative views on the band. Although, they're shallow insults at best that really tell you nothing, such as "They suck" or "I hate that band".\u000a\u000aOne such argument with one of my friends is sad, as he basically says "How can you like Epica if you like bands like Iced Earth and Blind Guardian?", or my "favourite" argument of "You're opinion doesn't matter because you like Epica*)\u000a\u000a* Epica can be interchanged with Nightwish, After Forever or Edenbridge\u000a\u000aBut as I've said, I have heard good reviews, but it's from people who want to listen to Symphonic Metal.
p4990
aVHuh... I have listened to most of Blind Guardian's stuff a few times, and while I like them, they just don't compare to Epica in my opinion. 
p4991
aVPeople don't like Epica?  If I mention them to anyone they don't know who they are. I don't have any metal head friends... T_T \u000a\u000aI found the growls difficult to like at first (I'm really, really picky when it comes to metal.) but I got used to them and now Epica is my favourite band.
p4992
aVHa... same here with the growls - used to hate them, now they're like the best part, and I growl along... I only have like 2 metalhead friends and we only speak occasionally, but they seemed to like Epica OK. 
p4993
aVThat's a reaction i've seen from many people towards female-fronted metal, which I love. For some metal must be more masculine and that's ok. To each his own.
p4994
aVI think the growls and heavy guitars/drums make it pretty masculine. Having the female vocals adds a nice dynamic to that I think... I don't think they'd be as good with male clean vocals... maybe if they changed the style a bit but the call and response between Simone and Mark that they use in a lot of songs is awesome. 
p4995
aVYeah, if I had to choose the "manliest" symphonic metal band, it'd definitely be Epica. They have a really strong/blunt presence and vibe compared to other bands in the genre.
p4996
aVI have experienced the opposite actually. All the non metal listeners that have experienced Epica have liked it at least a little.
p4997
aVI certainly have no hate for them, I've just never heard any songs from them that really grabbed my attention.  I don't see the hate though, going to my usual concerts the last few years (Nightwish, Delain, Within Temptation, Kamalot, etc) I hear nothing but praise from people I chat with.  I'm usually the odd one out because I'm not a total fanatic for them.
p4998
aV[deleted]
p4999
aVI think it has something to do with how snobbish certain metal fans can get when you're not listening to something they like. It's pretty much herd mentality -- if you're not with me, then you're my enemy. Some of them seem to think being a metal fan also means being 3 edgy 5 u for some odd reason...\u000a\u000aPretty sure my love for Within Temptation and Amaranthe would have me being labelled as not being a 'true' metalhead by people like those, but in all honesty, who really gives a storming fuck? Listen to what you enjoy. Everything else is just white noise and irrelevant.
p5000
aVI don't hate Epica, but they make a very average music, often even boring when it comes to singing. I wished they would make more out of their instruments and vocals. Their songs never spoke to me, they lack creativity and depth :-(\u000aI didn't know many people hate them, though.
p5001
aVhm, i don't think you've actually listened to a lot of their songs.\u000a\u000awhat are your views on the "new age dawns" songs?
p5002
aVThe Last Crusade - actually very nice :-)\u000aMother Of Light - somehow free of emotion and, yes, boring.\u000aConsign To Oblivion - too long, and not thrilling enough for that length, gets repetitive; I like the first transition from the female voice to the growls, though, it's really well done.\u000aResign To Surrender - repetitive; I think if you make repetitive music, there should be at least a cool melody you are looking forward to hear again.\u000aKingdom Of Heaven - the intro is too long, unnecessary repetitions, then it gets more powerful, but it's unemotional again. \u000aDesign Your Universe - very cool till she starts singing for the first time as the melody is, sorry to say that again, borring.\u000aI think, the songs lack emotions, something that would make you 'Wow'. I love the instruments and the power, and I think the combination of the female voice and the growling can be really interesting. I just wished they were emotionally more expressive. Sometimes the instruments sound like being randomly put together, without any deeper idea behind the song. That's only my impression, of course. I think, Epica has all the potential, they only need a more creative song writer ;-).
p5003
aVhaha, you and i have very opposite opinions
p5004
aVHaha, well, that's interesting about the world. People are individuals and have various preferences and opinions. If we would agree on everything, there would be nothing left to discuss, and THIS would be more boring than the music of Epica, hehe ;-) No, it's not that bad. I prefer Epica to pop music *shudder* ANY TIME!
p5005
aVit's just that you say stuff like "it lacks emotions and it doesn't make me go "wow"" and yet those are the exact feelings i feel when i hear the songs: design your universe, consign to oblivion, kingdom of heaven(btw, in this song, just imagine the mayan civilization being built in fast motion and a slave whom thought life was now different now that there is a new king has his world turned upside down), return to surrender, and mother of light.\u000a
p5006
aVIt's good to hear that these songs touch you. It was nice talking to you, Endrance88. Maybe we'll run into each other in another discussion about another band again :-) Take care!
p5007
aVThey definitely don't lack creativity, depth or instrumental variety.\u000a\u000aThat being said though, I know some people will get sort of turned off because a lot of their music can sound somewhat formulaic, repetitive and "dry"/unemotional.
p5008
aVYou read my mind, Archanoth. That is exactly what I meant: formulaic, "repetitive and "dry"/unemotional. You put it better in words than I ever could. Thank you.
p5009
aVI think the problem is that they are fairly average musicians, but very good entertainers and they cater to a very specific niché.\u000a\u000aSo either you love them because they write exactly what you love and want to hear or you hate them for being too harsh (casual listener) or not harsh enough ("TRVE METAL PLS").
p5010
aVUnleashed, Storm the Sorrow and Never Enough were fairly repetitive... most of the others not so much. 
p5011
aVHeh, I find it funny that you mentioned all the singles. I also tend to find singles fairly boring, though I quite like Unleashed and Storm the Sorrow.\u000a\u000aFor me, some of the worst offenders would be Menace of Vanity, The Divine Conspiracy title track, Guilty Demeanor, Never Enough as well, and probably a few tracks in Consign to Oblivion.\u000a\u000aVast majority of their songs are really great though.
p5012
aVBoring?! Welcome to my bad side! &gt;:) 
p5013
aVMy problem with Epica is they're just kind of a generic hodgepodge of wildly different metal and classical tropes, that don't often go well together. The classical bits are written in the same vein as Nightwish, but lack subtly. The guitars seem to oscillate between groove metal and "radio" metal, sometimes being adventurous with rhythms; others staying very much in the safe zone. Simone is a good singer, but lacks power and conviction. Mark also is skilled, but doesn't do anything special. The drums are standard fare for heavy metal- not very technically challenging, very consistent beats that act as a fancy metronome. I haven't ever paid attention to their bassist, so I can't speak of that. \u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong; I like Epica. They're cool. They just don't bring anything special to the table. They have found their comfort zone in being a hybrid of Kamelot, Nightwish, and Lacuna Coil; and I doubt they are going to stray from that.\u000a\u000aMy main reason for REALLY liking bands, being a musician myself, is that they bring something unique or special to the table. For Archspire and The Faceless, it's technical wankery. For Nightwish and Fleshgod Apocolypse, it's amazing songwriting. For Dying Fetus and Slipknot, it's stage presence in general. For Ne Obliviscaris and Korpiklaani, it's the vocal delivery. For Beyond Creation and Meshuggah, it's the tonalities. For Machine Head and The Haunted, it's the banging riffs. \u000a\u000aEpica just isn't special in any way.
p5014
aVI am not sure if we are listening to the same band?\u000a\u000aIf anything, I would compare Epicas classical progness to Therion. NWs writes symphonic power metal with very epic fantasy themes, the songs are very catchy but the orchestration/keyboard is fairly simple (at least after Oceanborn). Epica writes about "real" topics, such as religion and science.\u000a\u000aAlso, almost all other Symphonic Metal bands in the same vein don't use harsh vocals (with few exceptions), like Amberian Dawn, Sirenia, Xandria, Within Temptation, Visions of Atlantis, ...\u000a\u000aAnd I don't see any musical connection to LC.
p5015
aVI'm a casual fan, but was looking forward to seeing them live when they opened for Symphony X about 7 years ago or so. This was the tour where Amanda Sommerville filled in for a sick Simone and they were absolutely awful live.\u000a\u000aEvery song they played sounded the same and the growls were horrendous. I like some death metal, and I'm a huge fan of the Gothenburg metal scene so I have nothing against growls, but Mark Jansen's growls are unbearable. 
p5016
aVI agree that Mark's live growls are sub-par... I think he has a hard time playing guitar and growling at the same time... a problem Sander Gommans (After Forever) didn't seem to have. 
p5017
aVsome people just think they are too badass for some things when really they are a pathetic waste of human life down in their mom's basement.
p5018
aVIs this insulting Epica or supporting it? 
p5019
aVlol now that you are confused, i will never tell.
p5020
aVAbsolutely love them. Except that Simone's voice has gotten a lot less powerful live..
p5021
aVIt depends on the gig. At the beginning of the tour she sings very well but has trouble on extended tours. Other symphonic metal bands have that problem as well. I think Therion are switching to another type of soprano for that exact reason.
p5022
aVIt's more a technique problem I think, professional classical/opera singers are trained to be able to sing very frequently for extended amounts of time.
p5023
aVIf anything it's definitely become much stronger

p5032
aVI was never a fan of Annlouice's operatic bits.  Sometimes she might have a good, powerful soprano part that might bring a more epic sound to a song, but most of the time her vocals felt out of place. Due to this, most of my favorite songs ended up being ones with male vocals. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I think the new female singer is a great fit for the band. I can't wait to hear more of their new material.
p5033
aVI think she's great. She's not meant to replace Annlouice anyway.\u000a\u000aThe song is awesome. It's really different from what I was expecting, but still sounds very much like DSO. Seems to have an Abba vibe to it.\u000a\u000aI suppose this is the sort of thing they meant when they talked about disco music influences on the new album and whatnot.\u000a\u000aCan't wait for the full thing to come out.
p5034
aVI think the unexpected part of their music is what I like most of them. Once the "fans" get their heads out of the "New singer = bad" circlejerk, everyone is going to like it.
p5035
aVit is just that DSO nowadays sounds like [insert the music genre here] + metal. They have lost the theatrical/operatic appeal. \u000a\u000aAnnlouice vocals made the band more avant-garde (she sings a lot differently than Tarja and company that want to have an angelic voice), one fine example is her weird vocals in 'Lucy Fears The Morning Star'.
p5036
aVYeah, I know what you mean.\u000a\u000aThe theatrical/operatic parts were good, but it did seem like they wanted to move away from it over time. It was mostly present in The Butcher's Ballroom and played a lesser role in the 2 following albums.\u000a\u000aThe current setup they have seems to allow for more experimentation (Pandora's Piñata was a very good example of this, since it mixed a lot of different genres and influences).\u000a\u000aBut yeah, I do agree that Annlouice is very unique and superior in a bunch of ways to Tarja and other female metal singers.
p5037
aVIt's very different but I like the new singer, although I'm going to miss Annlouice like crazy, she had the raw power that I find a lot of symphonic metal singers are missing. Tarja has the perfect beautiful, gothic voice, but she can't shatter glass like Annluoice. But holy shit, the instrumental part is AMAZING. Some of the best I've heard from DSO. Love it.
p5038
aVI liked the new singer more as the song went on.  But the beginning just didn't sound right to my ears.  Those first two lines actually sounded horrible.  Is it just me, or did the "signs" of "secret signs" sound off-key?

aVIt's decent. Drums, guitars, and synth are spot on. Singer could use more dynamics, and her voice sounds a little forced... it doesn't sound like she's singing in her natural range (just my impression, I really don't know anything about singing).

VIgnore the cringeworthy Windows Movie Maker video. Of the fistful of YouTube videos this song has, this had the best audio quality I could find.
p5085
aVI love this song, it's one of my favourite albums.\u000a\u000aA good way to find good quality songs on YouTube is to filter by *High Definition* - for example: www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nightwish+ocean+soul%2C+hd&amp;oq=nightwish+ocean+soul%2C+hd
p5086
aVDoes the HD filter also search for best quality audio, and not just video? If so, it's certainly an excellent trick to know.
p5087
aVChances are that if the video is HD that the audio is at a decent bitrate. It may not apply in every single case, but generally it should.

aVOh OK, cool! From the way it was worded on one of the fan pages, I  thought she was leaving altogether. Glad she's still doing vocal work, she's like my favorite vocalist in symphonic metal.
p5100
aVI saw the news in one of the fan pages as well and thought she had left the band all together, but fortunately it's just for touring. Not only is she one of my favorite singers and one of the few that I truly consider an opera singer, but also Therion's best soprano (and they've had quite few). \u000a

p5102
(lp5103
VThis album is shaping up to be amazing.  2 guest vocalists who both can sing anything from soaring clean vocals to each a unique growling style, and no hint to which yet. And just the video of My Masquerade,  maybe even an overarching theme with it being The Human Contradiction.  April can't come fast enough.
p5104
aVOh, good, it seems this album is going to be heavier than the previous. \u000aWe Are the Others was fine, but the first two were better and I hope the new one will be similar.
p5105
aVFeels like all the albums this year will return to some heavier roots, except for Within Temptation who's starting to feel a like like Evanescence :/
p5106
aVI don't think that is entirely fair -  Hydra's biggest weakness is that it comes after The Unforgiving. That's not to say its not a weak album, just that we've been kind of spoiled. Frankly Evanescence's self titled album was stronger than Hydra and I didn't think many good thoughts about that one either. 
p5107
aVI'm not saying albums need to be heavy, its symphonic metal not heavy or death metal.\u000a\u000aI meant that Evanescence was the (and some people will kill for saying this) symphonic metal band that made it to the popular music stations. The easiest way to explain to people what symp. metal is is to tell them that the Evanescence songs they know are symp. metal.\u000a\u000aWT has the same problem,  they got really big as a group and now they wanna make songs that can actually be as popular as some of The Unforgiving has been and its turning their music into pop more than into Symphonic Metal. Its not bad music,  I just don't like buying the album of a symphonic metal band and end up listening to pop music. 
p5108
aVTo be fair WT has always been more inclined to appeal the mainstream masses. *Mother Earth* (aside from being the cheesiest) was the album that demonstrated that with "Ice Queen". Ever since that release, each album that followed has subsequently been more simplistic and commercial. The comparisons with Evanescence started with THOE's "What Have You Done" which was compared to "Bring Me To Life". *Hydra* may conspicuously be the most commercial, but it's also the most complex when it comes to musicianship and mind even their heaviest (Dangerous, Silver Moonlight, Tell Me Why) since *Enter* or *The Dance*.
p5109
aVI didn't mean to imply that their albums needed to be heavy. Just that they weren't that good. \u000a\u000aI see what you're saying with regard The Unforgiving and don't entirely disagree with the point or the sentiment as I share the latter. I think though that The Unforgiving caught WT off guard a bit in terms of popularity, but then again every album they've put out has had a very distinctive feel to it - Hydra is no different in this regard but it feels like a work in progress. All this means is that any perceived loss of quality is exacerbated. \u000a\u000aBut I stand by my statement that Evanescence self titled release was a better album than Hydra is if for no other reason than in terms of consistency. 
p5110
aVIMO Hydra is just continuing the trend they started with The Unforgiving... and I didn't like The Unforgiving that much. Very little symphony, and a whole lot less metal. Makes me sad that you can actually compare WT to Evanescence now. :-(
p5111
aVThat was due to the label, I believe. They delayed the album because they wanted it to be more commercial - if you compare the single version of We Are The Others to the album version, you can see that they tried to take out the metal elements.\u000a\u000aI remember an interview at the time where the band said that the label told them to not have Marco on the record because people would think they were dependent on him, or something along those lines. Now that Delain have changed labels to Napalm, I think they're going to go for a more metal direction once again. Since they've brought back Marco and are having growls from Alissa, this certainly seems likely!
p5112
aVThis is exactly what I wanted to hear :D
p5113
aVHas there been any indication if there will be any other guest artists?
p5114
aVHopefully we're in for one or two more. I figure if it was just the two they'd announce Marco as the final guest vocalist.
p5115

asVWhat is your opinion of Within Temptation ?
p5118
(lp5119
VI'm a huge fan! I would recommend trying all of their albums at least once, since they're all so different. \u000a\u000a- *Enter* and *The Dance* are more like gothic doom, though the band stated they felt like they were just copying the metal bands they liked at the time so they went in a bit of a different direction. \u000a\u000a- *Mother Earth* was their first symphonic album, it's quite folky and epic and Sharon sings a bit differently on it, in a sort of Kate Bush style. \u000a\u000a- *The Silent Force* is more in the realm of symphonic rock, very melodic and catchy stuff, and...\u000a\u000a- *The Heart of Everything* is a continuation of that, perhaps a little heavier and a bit more of the epic sound returns.\u000a\u000a- *The Unforgiving* is rather different, but not as different as some people think (I admit I didn't like it at all to start with, but now it's one of my favourite albums ever). Some of the singles are more commercial sounding but amongst the rest there are some really epic, beautiful and surprisingly heavy songs. It's also a concept album and it's a good idea to read up on The Unforgiving comics and watch the videos to get a feel for what it's about. \u000a\u000a- Then there's *Hydra* which is out next year - the band have stated it will be "their most metal yet" so it will be very interesting to hear it. It has a lot of guest singers (and one guest rapper...)\u000a\u000aThere's also a few live DVDs - *Black Symphony* is wonderful and a must-watch if you're getting into WT. You can get a live CD of their acoustic show which is pretty but not that essential unless you're a big fan. Same with the QMusic covers album.
p5120
aVWithin Temptation is the band that got me into symphonic metal with their Mother Earth album. I'll always love their early work (Mother Earth, The Dance, Enter).\u000a\u000a I don't like the direction they're going in for the last few years though. While The Silent Force and The Heart of Everything are great,The Unforgiving disappointed. I didn't like the acoustic live album all that much either. \u000a\u000aTheir new song with Tarja sounds good, but I fear most of the new album will move away from symphonic metal. 
p5121
aVI agree with you in many ways. I really miss the old sound of WT but I still like the direction they've taken. The latest album was definitely not symphonic metal, though. I hope that they'll reintroduce that aspect into their work.Have you listened to the demos that were included on the "Paradise" EP? They seem to be drawing some influences from their former work in those (I get kind of an "Jane Doe" feeling on some of the demos). My favourite demo is "Silver Moonlight". I'm starting to get excited to see how the next album will pan out.
p5122
aVWhat genre would you label the last album with?
p5123
aVSymphonic rock or alt. rock, I guess. The labels themselves aren't important, my main point is that their old work and new work is miles apart. I'm not saying this to disparage their later work, as I said I do like the later albums as well. But I would like to hear some of their roots emerging on future albums.
p5124
aVPop metal?
p5125
aVSymphonic rock with a 80s feel is what they were aiming for.
p5126
aVAh, that would explain why it sounded strange and unusual to me.
p5127
aVJust thought i'd give them another chance and i like what i hear so far on The Heart of Everything i'll try their previous albums then if the newer ones aren't that great.
p5128
aVI especially enjoyed Enter. That album was my introduction to them and I really dug the combo of both voices. I really miss Westerholt's grunts on later albums...
p5129
aVRobert will be doing grunts again on Hydra, you can hear him on the demo track Silver Moonlight at least. :)
p5130
aVWhen I heard that demo it got me excited for Hydra. I hope it doesn't disappoint. 
p5131
aVThat is GREAT news! 
p5132
aVI thought only Sharon did the vocals on the albums :O
p5133
aVTry the title track on Enter. The overlapping vocals are what defined Within Temptation for me early on.
p5134
aVSelatcia is right, its even noted on the wikipedia article\u000a\u000a"Orphanage vocalist George Oosthoek performed some of the growls on "Deep Within"\u000a\u000aI don't know if there was a difference between the albums and live performances but:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cIyYCoyfTc
p5135
aVThat is one of my favorite all time videos. It gives me chills. 
p5136
aVThey're my favourite band, Silent Force and The Heart of Everything are my 2 favourite albums, but The Unforgiving really grew on me, songs like Lost and Fire and Ice are 2 of my all time favourite songs, the vocals are incredble.
p5137
aVThose songs are just songs to sing along and shout to. Thhey're so awesome! A Demon's Fate, too
p5138
aVLove em. All time favourite band. The old stuff is brilliant, but The Unforgiving was phenomenal. Every song was kickass and singalongable.
p5139
aVThey got me into symphonic metal with their Running Up That Hill cover, and The Heart of Everything album. I came to love all of their stuff. Every album is different, but great in its own way. They aren't the heaviest of bands, and that's not a bad thing.
p5140
aVI loved seeing them live.\u000a\u000aSharon jumped and danced the entire set despite how hot the air was and that it was not long after she gave birth.\u000a\u000aIt also impressed me that she sounds like on the albums, unlike other symphonic metal vocalists.
p5141
aVI heard them early on, but did not hear Enter. I have loved every album the later ones have taken some getting used to, but you know what? They still talk about the same things, the things that the band finds important. I respect that, even if the sound has changed.
p5142
aVThey are my favorite band. I really recommend seeing their "black symphony" concert, which contains many clips on youtube. 
p5143
aVI started listening to them recently and I absolutely love The Unforgiving. Their old stuff is good too.

VGuy who dances way too much, here. I don't do much ballroom, so I'm not going to be able to pin down specific dance styles from that family, but I can tell you if songs are dancable and make stabs at the styles. \u000a\u000aA lot of symphonic metal doesn't have a clearly associated dance. I'm going to stick to more formal dances, and leave out things like, "Oh, you could totally contemporary dance this!"\u000a\u000aHere's my opinion of the songs that have been posted so far:\u000a\u000aEver Dream - Nightwish: Nope. \u000a\u000aI Walk Alone - Tarja Turunen: Yep. I'm not sure what it would be, but it is in the realm of Ballroom. You may also be able to tango nueva to it. \u000a\u000aWithin Temptation - Angels: Nope. \u000a\u000aWithin Temptation - Memories: Nope. \u000a\u000aNightwish - While Your Lips Are Still Red: I like this one. It's in 4/4 (I think) and got a dancable tempo. \u000a\u000aNightwish - Walking in the Air: Nope.\u000a\u000aNightwish: The Islander: Definitely dancable. Waltz and V Waltz, specifically. \u000a\u000aEpica - Tides of Time: Nope. \u000a\u000aEpica - Twin Flames: Nope. \u000a\u000aXandria - Eversleeping: Almost definitely dancable. I don't know what style would be best, though.\u000a\u000aAre You The One - Sharon Den Adel: Probably dancable, but it's a bit wonky. \u000a\u000aNightwish - Forever Yours: You *could* dance to it. That doesn't mean you *should*.\u000a\u000aEpica - Feint: Nope. \u000a\u000aEpica - Tides Of Time: Nope. \u000a\u000aEpica - Delirium: Nope. \u000a\u000aEpica - Nostalgia: Probably not. \u000a\u000aEpica - Linger: Nope. \u000a\u000aI'm not trying to tell you what to dance to, because you can make virtually anything work. I'd recommend finding a local dance studio and taking in your favorites. They should be able to put specific styles to them, and maybe even give you lessons for a few weeks to make your first dance even more kickass. 
p5154
aV&gt; Nightwish - Forever Yours: You could dance to it. That doesn't mean you should.\u000a\u000aI laughed a fair bit at this. Nightwish are my favourite band of all time but Forever Yours is probably my least favourite song!
p5155
aVThis list helps a lot. Thanks. I already know a great song, but it was recently used by a friend - Remember by Dommin.
p5156
aVHey, if you like it, talk with your friend. If your friend is a decent sort, (s)he should be flattered that you liked it so much, and be happy to have you use it as well.\u000a\u000aAs a dancer, it's about 50/50. It's very intense, very appropriate thematically, and is pretty dynamic. But, for most dances, there needs to be a nearly continuous, strong beat, which this song lacks. It seems to fall into a lyrical dance style than the social dance style (e.g. ballroom, latin, swing, etc). I'm more familiar with the latter, so I can't really give you advice there. 
p5157
aVNightwish's [Islander](http://youtu.be/GGQZwWsgovc) can be danced as a waltz, which, according to Wikipedia, is the most traditional of the first dances in weddings. The lyrics are sort of wistful but in other regards I think it fits like a charm.

aVHeavier and more complex just about sums it up for me as well. I think that's why I like it more. I can also see this being an acquired taste for some folks, but they had me at the first note. The opening track is fantastic. \u000a\u000aI actually hadn't heard Sins yet, the version I got doesn't have the bonus track :( Thanks for posting it!\u000a\u000aI'm glad that Floor came back from her illness kicking ass, as evidenced by the Nightwish tour, and now this. &lt;3
p5187
aVI agree with you that it's a better album than the first one. *Distorted Lullabies* is my favorite track.\u000a\u000aBut now I'm really torn because I want Floor to be Nightwish's lead, but if that happens then Revamp might have to disband...
p5188
aVNot necessarily, it's possible to do both as long as both bands are mindful of each other. :)
p5189
aVMarco still plays in tarot and empuu has a side project with his brother. Toumas has a solo album coming up too. Nightwish is big enough now that they don't have to do an album every two years (and likely won't) Personally i'd like to see Nightwish go with guest vocals on the albums and then just pick up a touring vocalist for the tour form here on out.

V**The Quantum Enigma:** \u000a\u000aTo me, this album is just flawless. I don't quite understand why it's as good as it is, even after hundreds of listens. \u000a\u000aIt's one of the few albums that increased in rating over time for me (at first, I gave it a 9-9.5/10, and it grew to be the only album I'd give a 10/10). \u000a\u000aIt's also the only album I would consider flawless, since I pretty much always find something to criticize or nitpick about (and I suppose I could find something here), but nothing remotely significant. \u000a\u000aAnd even after hundreds of listens, I still can't really pick favorites, which has pretty much never happened to me before. I literally love every song on that album. It's really weird.\u000a\u000a**Rating: 10/10**\u000a___\u000a**Requiem for the Indifferent and Design Your Universe:** \u000a\u000aHere I can't really pick. I love both albums equally. They're both excellent albums but also flawed, and in a way, both sides of the same coin. \u000a\u000a**Design Your Universe**, I think, was the album that not only made Epica really popular, but proved how good they were as a band. Lots of excellent songs, with the highlight of that album being by far Kingdom of Heaven, which still stands as one of the best songs ever written. The album, however, fell short due to its overly formulaic and repetitive structure in parts, as well as the presence of "filler" songs (Burn to a Cinder and White Waters are the offenders here).\u000a\u000a**Requiem for the Indifferent**, on the other hand, is a very underrated album. I know most people tend to not like it much, but it's a very creative, experimental, progressive and heavily technical album. It shows just how talented the band members can be, despite a lot of the songs not being very melodic or memorable, and the sound mixing being disappointing (especially compared to DYU). \u000a\u000aIt has some strong, dark themes with memorable lyrics, really beautiful songs (Avalanche, Serenade of Self-Destruction and Delirium are highlights here), as well as weird, amazing and complicated tracks (like Monopoly on Truth, Requiem for the Indifferent and Deter the Tyrant). It falls short to due a sub-par sound mix, lack of memorable melodies, existence of filler tracks, just like in DYU (the offenders here being Guilty Demeanor and Stay the Course).\u000a\u000a**Rating: 9/10 (both)**\u000a___\u000a**The Divine Conspiracy:**\u000a\u000aThis album marks the turning point for Epica. I think every long-lasting great band reaches this "turning point", where they release an album so good that it marks a huge boost in their career, and they start being taken more seriously and get recognized alongside the bigger names. \u000a\u000aThis album was the cornerstone that defined the modern Epica sound, and it includes some of the most amazing and memorable tracks (The Obsessive Devotion, Chasing the Dragon, Death of a Dream, Fools of Damnation and Beyond Belief). \u000a\u000aHowever, it also falls short due to flawed songwriting (the title track is a huge example of this), weird pacing and filler tracks (Never Enough is the biggest offender, Menace of Vanity and Living a Lie are particularly pointless too).\u000a\u000a**Rating: 8.5/10**\u000a___\u000a**The Phantom Agony:**\u000a\u000aThis is probably one of the best debut albums ever made, and even though Mark Jansen had already made a name for himself in After Forever, The Phantom Agony stood out as a unique album in the symphonic metal space due to its classical and progressive influences, good balance of female vocals, choirs and growls, great songwriting, great "controversial" politics/religion-themed lyrics and a nice dark atmosphere.\u000a\u000aIt also has some really memorable tracks, including Cry for the Moon, Façade of Reality, Seif al Din and the title track.\u000a\u000a**Rating: 7.5/10**\u000a___\u000a\u000a**Consign to Oblivion:**\u000a\u000aThis is definitely the weakest Epica album. A good album still, but somewhat disappointing compared to the others. \u000a\u000aAside from the title track (which is great but still overrated), there are several good tracks, such as The Last Crusade, Solitary Ground, Blank Infinity, Force of the Shore, Quietus and Another Me, though most of them aren't really overly special or memorable. \u000a\u000aAt the same time, we have a few weird tracks, such as Dance of Fate, Mother of Light and Trois Vierges, which aren't bad tracks by any means, but they feel out of place in regards to the rest of the album, and arguably compared to the rest of Epica's material. \u000a\u000aIt also feels a bit too "light" and "non-metal-y", and the sound mix isn't great (similarly to Requiem for the Indifferent), which reduces a lot of the impact the album has. Some of these tracks sound way better live, with the current band lineup.\u000a\u000a**Rating: 6.5/10**
p5233
aVYou basically have the order I'd put the albums in myself.\u000a\u000aThe Quantum Enigma disc has been in my car's CD changer since the day it was released and I haven't removed it since then. Every other disc in there has been swapped out at some point, but TQE managed to never get removed because I always find myself wanting to listen to it at some point.

I'll listen to DYU and think it's better than TQE, but then I'll listen to TQE and think it's better than DYU.\u000a\u000a\u000aSome songs on RftI are some of my favourites by them, Serenade of Self-Destruction, Monopoly on Truth and Deep Water Horizon. But the actual album "mixing" makes it sound unfinished and amateur
p5236
aVI agree with requiem for the indifferent being the worst. And it's interesting to see that most people here put it at the bottom also. I just thought the vocals and overall tone of the instruments sounded quite weak compared to their other albums
p5237
aVI still haven't bought two of the CDs because of difficulty finding them without costing 40 USD. Otherwise here's my order (most liked to least liked):\u000a\u000aConsign to Oblivion\u000a\u000aThe Quantum Enigma\u000a\u000aDesign Your Universe\u000a\u000aThe Divine Conspiracy\u000a\u000aThe Phantom Agony\u000a\u000aRequiem for the Indifferent.\u000a\u000aI honestly like all the CDs because they have their own unique sound, but something about Requiem for the Indifferent bothers me because it just seems less.. complete. Still love it though.

I really like all their albums but my least favourite is probably TPA since I rarely listen to it as a whole.
p5240
aV* The Divine Conspiracy\u000a\u000a* Design Your Universe\u000a\u000a* The Quantum Enigma\u000a\u000a* Requiem for the Indifferent\u000a\u000a* Consign to Oblivion\u000a\u000a* The Phantom Agony\u000a\u000aI don't have Consign to Oblivion or The Phantom Agony because they're difficult to get here in the UK, so that may factor into why I don't like them as much. Overall Epica doesn't have any *bad* albums in my opinion, but TDC and DYU stand out considerably ahead of the other four. Requiem had too many songs that sounded the same, CtO and TPA are less memorable than their later stuff, and TQE doesn't have a distinguished sound that it's three predecessors all had (it sounds like DYU part 2 to me, but with a weaker ending).
p5241
aVThe Divine Conspiracy tops. It's dark, heavy (how I like my metal!) and touches on issues I identify with.\u000a\u000aThen Consign to Oblivion. It has some great melodies and composition and of course the title track is just phenomenal.\u000a\u000aThis is where I get in indecisive. I'd probably say The Quantum Enigma but Design Your Universe has Kingdom of Heaven. I have to say though, aside from Kingdom of Heaven and the title track not many other songs stand out to me.  I know lots of people like Unleashed and Martyr of the Free Word but I just don't find them that interesting. So I'd say TQE third for its technical prowess and DYU fourth.\u000a\u000aBetween The Phantom Agony and Requiem for the Indifferent I'd say the former is more memorable with grander songs and themes, though Serenade of Self Destruction and Monopoly on Truth are absolutely cracking.\u000a\u000aTl;Dr\u000a\u000aThe Divine Conspiracy\u000a\u000aConsign to Oblivion\u000a\u000aThe Quantum Enigma\u000a\u000aDesign Your Universe\u000a\u000aThe Phantom Agony\u000a\u000aRequiem for the Indifferent

p5243
aVI find Epica goes in a pattern of "every odd numbered album is alright, yet every even numbered album is amazing". That may be just me, but it justifies my list.\u000a\u000a* Design Your Universe\u000a* The Quantum Enigma\u000a* Cosign to Oblivion\u000a* The Divine Conspiracy\u000a* The Phantom Agony\u000a* Requiem For the Indifferent
p5244
aVWhen it comes to enjoying every song in the album, The Phantom Agony is at the top as I actually like every single song. \u000a\u000aConsidering which albums are the most all-out awesome RFTI is my favorite, followed by DYU and TDC being tied. \u000a\u000aConsign to Oblivion was the first Epica album I got into and it has some of my favorite songs, but just not as heavy as the others. \u000a\u000aI am probably the one person here who lists The Quantum Enigma as my least favorite, so here are my reasons: The Essence of Silence and Victims of Contingency - great songs but the chorus repeats too much on both of them. Unchain Utopia - too many chorus repeats and a weak ending, despite nice verse and chorus melodies, repetition kills this one. Reverence - nice intro and verse but boring and overly repetitive chorus, same thing with Omen. Canvas of Life is quiet which is OK but simply not my preference. The title track, "The Quantum Enigma" starts out SO strong with great intro and verses, but once it hits the halfway point it basically falls apart with a weak instrumental development section, and a disappointing ending, both of which ruin the awesomeness built up in the first half of the song... this is kind of like what was starting to happen in the song "Kingdom of Heaven" in DYU, but they saved that song by adding an awesome bridge and the "YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK" part near the end which gave some contrast and made KOH a good song. The second half of the song "The Quantum Enigma" has to be the single biggest disappointment from Epica I have ever heard. It's like they forced a bunch of "filler" material to make the song 2x longer than it needed to be. Finally, TQE the album in general is not dark enough for my tastes, there is not much growling, and the choruses are too airy and boring. Still I love songs like Memento, Sense Without Sanity, Chemical Insomnia, the Second Stone, Natural Corruption, Mirage of Verity, Dreamscape, and Victims of Contingency and think the Essence of Silence is very good. Also I was dissapointed in the lack of growling in this album...

Some are very well known, and some are a little more obscure.  \u000a\u000aEpica: [Cry For The Moon](http://youtu.be/Dys1_TuUmI4) | [Quietus](http://youtu.be/uZxVND_tdtI) | [Chasing the Dragon](http://youtu.be/bidIrp1gZoc) | [Sancta Terra](http://youtu.be/3xrakyBNzvs) | [Design Your Universe](http://youtu.be/JR6aKhnAcFA) | [Avalanche](http://youtu.be/h1L_XgPbvGc) | [Stabat Mater Dolorosa](http://youtu.be/DMqUJdqRerE)  \u000a\u000aWithin Temptation: [Mother Earth](http://youtu.be/iOgy_No29cs) | [Jillian (I'd Give My Heart)](http://youtu.be/IOYgWyZ4Qz8) | [Blue Eyes](http://youtu.be/CrPKTVehCPw)  \u000a\u000aLeaves' Eyes: [Elegy](http://youtu.be/0r7Bb8fwJVI) | [Scarborough Fair](http://youtu.be/6lDDLTHQBx4) | [Hell to the Heavens](http://youtu.be/cE17AodKrus) | [Symphony of the Night](http://youtu.be/1AOVC030DoY) \u000a\u000aDelain: [Frozen](http://youtu.be/T2WJZpvopng) | [The Gathering](http://youtu.be/haywgHt_grI) | [I'll Reach You](http://youtu.be/D0C1WvC6-XQ) | [Nothing Left](http://youtu.be/_S_ommJv98Q) | [Electricity](http://youtu.be/JU-zu4B5BRo)\u000a\u000aXandria: [A Prophecy of Worlds Fall](http://youtu.be/0vLwWtSwNTI) | [Euphoria](http://youtu.be/gIMRvsYtnvI)  \u000a\u000aSirenia: [Darkling](http://youtu.be/etUyenyRClk) | [Ditt Endelikt](http://youtu.be/ltt7QwgWX2o)  \u000a\u000aMidnattsol: [Kong Valemons Kamp](http://youtu.be/segN5XYGLQo) | [Forlorn](http://youtu.be/W8wAzuzjBxU)  \u000a\u000aMaYaN: [Insano](http://youtu.be/Yk8sRT3jegE) | [Essenza Di Te](http://youtu.be/sH5Wbhz0QzI)  \u000a\u000aKrypteria: [All Systems Go](http://youtu.be/PhLgUv6sTFI)  \u000a\u000aKatra: [One Wish Away](http://youtu.be/U_jk1Zxyoe0) | [Grail of Sahara](http://youtu.be/ZcY0El-xqcI)  \u000a\u000aKamelot: [Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife)](http://youtu.be/XsnTUP6Tf4U) | [The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)](http://youtu.be/qmy61wRBbLY)  \u000a\u000aEyes of Eden: [Winter Night](http://youtu.be/Y6BfTYRN9iI) | [Star](http://youtu.be/6I7J_Fy0O80)  \u000a\u000aBlind Guardian: [Sacred Worlds](http://youtu.be/CFZ_Uyqbr4k) | [Wheel of Time](http://youtu.be/y_ts8cPScXM)  \u000a\u000aHaggard: [Awaking the Centuries](http://youtu.be/2iTlu3STCdI) | [Per Aspera Ad Astra](http://youtu.be/BSFEv9eaoh4) | [Herr Mannelig](http://youtu.be/1Hdgb53QVaY) | [Eppur Si Muove](http://youtu.be/cE4YRnjrM1Q)  \u000a\u000aAdagio: [Next Profundis](http://youtu.be/cRvFrkie-Zw) | [Chosen](http://youtu.be/edpFB1NOxt4)  \u000a\u000aThere are plenty more bands/songs that I left out, but I think this gives a good variety. 
p5289
aVWoah, Blind Guarian - Wheel of Time... It's amazing! Makes me want to read the series all over again.
p5290
aVYea that song is excellent, the whole album is really. I'm excited for their new album. Supposedly, they're going to use a whole orchestra. 
p5291
aVThis is rather an open-ended question! I was staring at it for a while trying to figure out what to give as an answer. I figured perhaps a good approach was just to list a bunch of bands I personally enjoy and link some of my favourite songs from each, in the hopes that you might find something new. So without further ado...\u000a\u000a\u000aNightwish: [Ghost Love Score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V_eoR6r1Tw), [The Poet and the Pendulum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HYgidYaBl8)\u000a\u000aWithin Temptation: [The Truth Beneath The Rose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyuJI73Uxns), [Iron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz2qeb_0Se8)\u000a\u000aEpica: [Kingdom of Heaven](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRO117a_R8), [Tides of Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSkYfZTdBjA)\u000a\u000aLeaves' Eyes: [Frøya's Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GBchsaurlk), [Farewell Proud Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FngCltID0)\u000a\u000aReVamp: [Precibus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADxb6z1Pu3c), [Here's My Hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_x2J6bG8E8)\u000a\u000aDelain: [Control the Storm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5a9wfFbfY), [Electricity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU-zu4B5BRo)\u000a\u000aAfter Forever: [Equally Destructive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q_Kkq2iwTY), [Dreamflight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtqppn--D_c)\u000a\u000aSerenity: [Wings of Madness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2QH9L42OY0), [Serenade of Flames](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tO0yXQSkzM)\u000a\u000aXandria: [India](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-RiBX4k60M), [A Prophecy of Worlds to Fall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vLwWtSwNTI)\u000a\u000aSirenia: [Seven Widows Weep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCxgJFjnZw), [The Mind Maelstrom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8CBzDocDdg)\u000a\u000aAmberian Dawn: [Come Now Follow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUAuu9h5eFs), [Arctica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTpSItforgY)\u000a\u000aTarja: [Crimson Deep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_mdnXboXE0), [Naiad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BcrFsnFuUI)\u000a\u000aWintersun: [Sons of Winter and Stars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMbFu457jGs), [Land of Snow and Sorrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_TBENcax_g)\u000a\u000aKamelot: [Sacrimony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORAc_hx33-Q), [March of Mephisto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0yYxOV-bRU)\u000a\u000aDamnation Angels: [Pride - The Warrior's Way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNerE4k4htM)\u000a\u000aWhyzdom: [Everlasting Child](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjX2a5ScEn8)\u000a\u000aVersailles: [Aristocrat's Symphony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwTZTmw_vgU)\u000a\u000aEdit: This isn't every symphonic metal band :) just a bunch of ones I enjoy. The full list would be considerably longer.
p5292
aVDon't forget about Apocalyptica, Theatre of Tragedy, and Tristania!
p5293
aVThey're tricky ones - whilst I enjoy all of them, Apocalyptica mainly only use cellos so I never know whether they truly count as symphonic or not. I see Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania as more gothic metal, but I'm sure a case could be made for including them in symphonic due to the use of operatic vocals etc. :)\u000a\u000aThough my list was by no means exhaustive, there are lots of other bands I didn't include.
p5294
aVOmg, thank you so much... I honestly thought symphonic metal/rock started with Avantasia and ended with Stratovaris (sp?)
p5295
aVStratovarius is a bit special, they are definitely symphonic metal but they also tend to do a lot of power metal (pretty much like Sonata Arctica). Avantasia is great too, but sadly they don't release as much albums as other bands and their last one was not so consistent.\u000a\u000aI would also add Therion too, with a special mention to Ginnungagap (the song, not the band).
p5296
aVMy list (warning: most of them have symphonic metal as secondary genre): \u000a\u000aLumus - The Cave (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URPYcNk0Tq8 )\u000a\u000aAmberian Dawn - Crimson Flower (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdr0b1SP9v8)\u000a\u000aDevil Doll - The Girl Who Was ... Death (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYdcApobjTY)\u000a\u000aDark Lunacy - Snowdrifts (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVrMRTw29G0)\u000a\u000aFleshgod Apocalypse - Epilogue (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QKpx943vO4)\u000a\u000aEstatic Fear - Chaper IV (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPR4gLwXpZ4)\u000a\u000aMidnattsol - Dancing with the midght sun (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akdxX5KTZ3U)\u000a\u000aAnkhragram - No Fate (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-WXSKih9Dw)\u000a\u000aDiablo Swing Orchestra - Ragdoll Physics (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adbCB-5n5C0)\u000a\u000aEnshine - Nightwave (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEerYScAzKk)\u000a\u000aTherion - Midgard (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USIjL6he2SU) \u000a\u000aSanguine Glacialis - La valse des condamnes (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ld2CdrcVKc)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p5297
aVupvote for DSO. they are very unique.
p5298
aVThey are my second favorite band, behind Devil Doll. Devil Doll is even more unique, you should try Devil Doll if you dont know it. Please just don't confuse it with the rockabilly band with the same name.
p5299
aVupvote for estatic fear. that whole album is hauntingly beautiful
p5300
aVMy personal favourites for now:\u000a\u000a1. Nightwish - Ghost Love Score (live in Buenos Aires) [Floor]\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA\u000a\u000a2.

Epica - Design Your Universe\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU9eQDWya6A\u000a\u000aI'm fully aware that I'm leaving out many great bands, but I really don't have the time to make a top 100 :-)
p5301
aVTurisas' ["Miklagard Overture"](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/1w84u2/on_the_front_page_today_is_an_image_of_viking/) for your epic Viking/Byzantine adventure fix! (and the rest of their second and third albums, too)\u000a\u000aEdit: Gonna throw Coronatus in here, too - what's better than one female soprano? Two of them. Here's their ["Fernes Land"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ2RVV5F1z8)
p5302
asVr/symphonicmetal survey results!
p5303
(lp5304
VI wonder how much of the love for The Quantum Enigma is based on the actual quality of it, or recent hype.\u000a\u000aMind you, I still think it's *fucking amazing*.
p5305
aVIndeed, I think it would be interesting to see how many people vote for it next year. I wouldn't be surprised if the 2015 Nightwish album got a ton of votes as well.
p5306
aVIt's funny to see that Dutch women seem to be quite profound at singing in sym metal bands :)
p5307
aV[deleted]
p5308
aVSame here, I remember being about 12 and loving Amy Lee because she was the only woman in a rock band that I knew of and could look up to. When I later discovered bands like Within Temptation and Nightwish it opened up a whole new world for me.
p5309
asVHaggard - Chapter I: Tales of Ithiria
p5310
(lp5311
sVElize Ryd - Nemo (Official Nightwish Cover)
p5312
(lp5313
VShe does an excellent job playing it [live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_Bc1YkSHA0) too.
p5314
aVAm I the only one who liked Annette? Seriously... she wasn't that bad.
p5315
aVShe was great in the studio. Kinda fell apart live. 
p5316
aVShe wasn't that bad, but they could have done better. I don't dislike Anette, but I don't think it was their wisest move.
p5317
aVShe did some greats songs of her own (I personally LOVE The Escapist) which fit well with her voice. What was really horrible was her singing old Nightwish songs, unlike Floor her voice has nothing to do with Tarja and the songs were not meant for her at all.
p5318
aVYea it's kind of like the new Amberian Dawn singer re-doing the old songs. \u000aBut she still isn't as bad as everyone makes her out to be.
p5319
aVCan't really blame people for hating on her, when you do a "meh" album with a new singer (lets face it, Dark Passion Play is not exactly the best Nightwish album :x) after the monster that Once is, you can only expect a bit of hate from the most passionate Tarja fans.
p5320
aVMany of us "the most passionate Tarja fans" have been listening Tarja since Angels fall first and Oceanborn, for some of us the better part of our teenage years. There is very little any replacement rock chick can do to fill the boots of someone like that - sucks for those who have started listening Nightwish more recently, but our preference for Tarja is deep rooted and those roots are not running in rational grounds.
p5321
aV[deleted]
p5322
aVI thought she sounded pretty good but I prefer her sound with Amaranthe. \u000a
p5323
asVWhat song first got you into symphonic metal? Post links!
p5324
(lp5325
VDefinitely [Ghost Love Score by Nightwish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3yqMr3ffY). I remember finding out about them when I was rocking out to Pandora and playing some Sacred 2. That was a beautiful moment.
p5326
aVThat may very well be the greatest symphonic metal song ever. The [live version with Floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA) is amazing.
p5327
aVFloor once said that Ghost Love Score has always been her favorite Nightwish song.  Singing it onstage is more or less a dream come true for her, and damn does she ever show it in this performance.
p5328
aVOne of the Nightwish songs she can sing very well for sure.
p5329
aVIn just 10 glorious, heavenly minutes, that song got me into both metal and opera. And it's still my favorite metal song today!
p5330
aVThis was my first symphonic metal song too. It was on the YTMND soundtrack, way back in the day. Still one of my favorites, though my favorite band is Epica now. For Epica, my "breakthrough" song was [Tides of Time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALDD5XaQuw)
p5331
aVNemo by Nightwish. For years previous, I had been lamenting the fact that death and black metal had great musicians, but shitty singers. The video for Nemo came up in my college's cafeteria and I was hooked.  
p5332
aVSame here. It was on some world or warcraft video, and I had never heard anything like it before. Feel completely in love and listened to Nightwish for years, wasn't until about a year ago that I started looking for other bands like them.\u000a\u000aI still think that Nemo is a great song, but I am not a huge fan of Tarja's voice. She can generally hit the notes, which is way better than a lot of bands, but still.
p5333
aV[Over the hills &amp; far away - Nightwish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4lxlLbEZrs)\u000a\u000aI listened to mostly rap before then, because that's all I knew. I heard this song somewhere and as one of my friends said "It's something I never knew I wanted."
p5334
aV[Dark Moor - "Vivaldi's Winter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcWZz-f1Orc)\u000a\u000aFirst ran into it as a selection in "Lute Hero", a minigame in a mod for Neverwinter Nights 2.
p5335
aVOooohhhh that's fantastic. I'll have to check out more of Dark Moor. Thanks for that!
p5336
aVHad some random playlist on my father's iPod (who doesn't even listen to rock nor metal at all) with a lot of great rock/metal songs in it.\u000a\u000a[Nightwish - Wishmaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU55Flooj3Y)! Instantly gave me the chills, and still does.
p5337
aVHamster! A dentist! 
p5338
aVHARDCORE, STEVEN SEAGULL
p5339
aV[Nightwish - Ghost Love Score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O8e2hMAL6c)\u000a\u000aA friend found it on YouTube at some point and he played it on the game Audiosurf (which we already loved together) and were absolutely blown away with how intense the song made the game to play. From that point on I absolutely loved the style of combining epic + metal. It remains one of my top favorite songs ever.\u000a\u000aHowever, the album that actually pushed me into liking the genre as a whole, rather than just a few songs, was [Kamelot's Ghost Opera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfOuil4d8Gc&amp;list=PLl0aHaDc1ws-7V2Cd6_9jK4_wPxCZgKLk). Loved it on first listen, and it holds a special place for me, even if it's not Kamelot's #1 work.
p5340
aV[White Pearl, Black Oceans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Zs-eGcAa4) by Sonata Arctica. (It was this actual video, too!) Basically a friend linked it to me because she knew I liked Final Fantasy.\u000a\u000aI still love it. It'll be one of my top favorite songs forever.
p5341
aVI just saw them in concert last week on their *Pariah's Child* Tour and, even having only heard a few of their songs on Pandora...I was blown away. (I went to the concert mostly because Delain was playing.)
p5342
aVI went to their concert too last month! They're one of my favorite bands, definitely. Glad you liked them!
p5343
aVI don't remember any specific song that got me into the genre, but rather an album. I used to listen to a lot of thrash, death, and power metal (still occasionally do). I was reading some thread about recently released metal albums and I saw this cover that immediately caught my attention. I read some of the reviews and an overwhelming majority favored it, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Holy shit, was I amazed. It was unlike anything I'd ever heard of. *Metal and classical instruments mixed? Where has this been all of my life?* I thought to myself. I instantly fell in love with that album, and soon afterwards the band. And then the genre. That album was Design Your Universe by Epica. It's a been a lovely five years since I accidentally stumbled upon that album. I now listen to a lot of symphonic metal bands.   
p5344
aV[Amaranth by Nightwish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdZn7k5rZLQ).  My sister downloaded it on her Ipod when it was free on Itunes. That was probably in '07. I couldn't stop listening to it, because I had never heard anything quite like it before. It's still a damn good song.
p5345
aVFor me it was [Within Temptation - Ice Queen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YbhB_A_8fM). \u000a\u000aIce Queen was incredibly popular in the Netherlands in 2001. It got me curious about Within Temptation, and Nightwish soon followed. I remember arguing with my high school friends about which of those two bands was better :-)\u000a\u000aI still like the song, but not nearly as much as I used to.
p5346
aVMy friend got me hooked when she convinced me to listen to Nightwish, the first song I heard was, if I recall correctly, [Seven Days to the Wolves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn4rkuzNmJw). However, for all the flak that they get, I got my first exposure through Evanescence, songs like [Lacrymosa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY2Er_M2Tt4).
p5347
aVLacrymosa is a great song, my favourite by Evanescence.
p5348
aVEvanescence is amazing. Such a good voice
p5349
aVSeven Days to the Wolves is amazing, love it.
p5350
aVAlthough I'd heard a couple of songs from the genre before, I think the first that really got me into it were:\u000a\u000aWithin Temptation - What Have You Done: http://youtu.be/gEgXDhiayz4\u000a\u000aWithin Temptation - The Howling: http://youtu.be/0bqRn0rLq1c\u000a\u000aI can't actually remember which I heard first.  I still absolutely love The Howling, but I've gone off WHYD a bit. I'm just generally not a big fan of WT's songs with guest vocalists for some reason, though I do really like Paradise.  \u000a
p5351
aVI think the first for me was [Within Temptation - All I Need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ViM8tKG1Q), from the Lacuna Coil Last.fm station.
p5352
aVFor me it was ["Our Solemn Hour" - Within Temptation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3t9YCYqPno), which came up on Last.fm's Evanescence channel.  I'd have to say that this is probably my favourite song of any genre, at least according to my Last.fm stats.\u000a\u000a
p5353
aV[blind gaurdian- the bards song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_tORtmKIjE)
p5354
aVMy life was complete the day I discovered Blind Guardian.
p5355
aVOh man, this. So much this. You might also like [Van Canto's cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBxCl2TJNnQ) of it. 
p5356
aVthe accapella version sounds more like it belongs in skyrim.

aVOut of the Ashes by Symphony X
p5358
aVIron Maiden got me into Metal and limewire had [Masquarade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lx2HR6JPNw) mislabeled on one of their albums. That was how I discovered symphonic metal.  
p5359
aV[God Has a Plan for Us All - Angtoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olFchpRcgao)\u000a\u000aThen I bought every album from Nightwish, Epica, and Kamelot.  \u000a\u000aAlso, this subreddit costs me too much money.  Everyone stop.  (don't stop)\u000a
p5360
aVI know it was a Rhapsody or Luca Turilli song, could've been [Emerald Sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5kLxQGbRYg) or [War of the Universe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU0xnpP3D60).
p5361
aVThe first Symphonic metal song I ever heard was [End of All Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJgK9wo6hyk), by Nightwish, and it was in a Street Fighter combo video of all places...  I thought it was kind of cool at the time but didn't really think anything further on it.  I heard them again in a Guilty Gear combo video a couple months later that used [The Kinslayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGheVcuufB0).  When I heard that song, I knew I needed to go buy that CD, immediately, so I did and I regret NOTHING.  Bought Century Child a little bit later, and Once when it came out, saw them in Anaheim 2004 (First real concert ever) and that was it.  Fan for life.  Still love both of those songs to this day.
p5362
aV[Nightwish - Planet Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7byFeQwAKnA) Nerdy, I know. I was young at the time when this happened and I search for many weeks for the song. Once I finally found it, I fell in love with a few Nightwish albums.
p5363
aVOh my gosh, yes. Planet Hell is an amazing work.\u000a\u000a...Scratch that. Nightwish is just an amazing band through and through.
p5364
aV[Storytime - Nightwish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5i7htF2AwY)  \u000a  \u000aor [Amaranthe - Razorblade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHeMck0Ap3I) : They aren't really symphonic metal, but they got me into metal bands with female lead singers, which led to symphonic metal.

p5366
aVI've listened to Trinity and Drop Dead Cynical so many times over the past few days...can't wait for the new album!
p5367
aVOh gosh, yes. When I saw them play with Within Temptation last month in LA, they did Drop Dead Cynical as one of their encore songs and it was freaking epic. 
p5368
aVAnd another here! I'm so hyped for Massive Addictive. Their music is the most awesome thing to listen to at the gym.
p5369
aVNightwish, definitely. I frequented a rock bar where Nightwish, WT and others were on the playlist pretty frequently, and "Over the Hills and Far Away" stuck with me enough for me to look it up the next day. \u000a\u000aThat started an obsession :D
p5370
aVWhere is this magical bar and is there an equivalent in Tulsa?
p5371
aVWell, it was certainly magical to me nearly 10 years ago :D Haven't been there in some time. I've never left Europe, so I wouldn't know if there was one near Tulsa.

aVKali Yuga - Therion
p5373
aVFor me it was [Path by Apocalyptica](http://youtu.be/U_oaPY0Brrw) which I randomly stumbled upon through some kind of automatically generated playlist.
p5374
aVThat would be Nightwish - The Siren https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqUoMfgMvM Still find it a nice song.
p5375
aVI'm still new to the real definition of symphonic metal, but I've always been really drawn to symphonic and folky black metal like Emperor, Bal-Sagoth, Limbonic Art, Finntroll, Burzum, Dimmu Borgir, Borknager, hell even some Cradle of Filth when I was younger - also some more proggy bands like Symphony X - all of which got me into metal with symphonic elements.etc.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't until recently I heard [Eluvietie - The Call of the Mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w2m-TeLi6I) (clearly not their best - by a long shot) and liked the folky/strings/classical sound of it and looked a bit deeper. A few months later and Eluvietie, Nightwish, Epica, Therion and Within Temptation is all I've been listening to. I'm fucking addicted and I love it.
p5376
aVI'm probably not the typical symphonic metal fan - I'm much older than the average, I suspect. I grew up listening to Black Sabbath which contains the roots to doomy gothic metal. Then heavy music went to shit in the '90s basically, and I stuck to the classic metal stuff. Years later, somehow, I discovered Evanescence when the Fallen album came out. Being in North America, this stuff was unheard of, so I searched for similar stuff. \u000a\u000aI was also exploring other metal (and still enjoy other genres), but the definitive song that really got me into this stuff was [Nymphetamine by Cradle of Filth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dW6aNAZGTM) - yes I realize this wouldn't qualify as "symphonic metal", but Liv Kristine sings it, so I searched her other stuff out and ran across early Leaves Eyes, leading me to other stuff like Tristania which blew me away. Inevitably I ran across Nightwish (still almost unheard of in Canada), Within Temptation, Epica, etc. \u000a\u000aTo me this is what metal has matured to.
p5377
aVHa, such a coincidence, mine was Nymphetamine too actually! My brother used to listen to Cradle a lot and I couldn't really get into it at first. But the combination of their typical growls and Liv's voice was amazing to me. It wasn't long after that I started looking into similar female voices in metal and found symphonic metal :)
p5378
aVYears ago at work, Pandora played me [Ghost Opera (by Kamelot)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-TUufvK0gU). I've been a symphonic metalhead ever since. Even now, I could listen to that on repeat and be perfectly happy.
p5379
aVThe was the song that got me really into Kamelot. Khan's vocals are amazing. As sad as I was to Khan leave, their new singer is very good. I think they will be just fine.
p5380
aVYeah, I've been a Kamelot fan ever since that, even digging back further to some of their older stuff (in particular, *The Black Halo*...so good!)\u000a\u000aWhen I first heard that Khan was leaving, I was a bit distressed. I knew that Tommy Karevik had some impressive shoes to fill. But Karevik's work through *Silverthorn* was nothing short of amazing; and I look forward to their next album (anticipated March 2015) with great joy. I can't wait to see them live when they get back into my area in May (with DragonForce, too!). It's going to kick so much ass...
p5381
aVMy only concern is that Tommy is trying too hard to sound like Khan. As much as I want him to sound just like him, I know he has to find his place in Kamelot and be himself. If this hiim being himself and it just sounds exactly like Khan, then i guess i can live with that. lol.
p5382
aVI love Kamelot and was actually surprised to find out that they had gotten a new vocalist. Dude sounds so much like the old singer that after listening to their entire discography a dozen times I still never noticed the vocalist was different....
p5383
aVI like how Tommy's been playing it so far, mostly like Khan but with putting his own personality into it. If you've heard him in any of his work with Seventh Wonder, it's basically exactly that same feel. I can understand that on the first album with him, you want to really introduce his vocal stylings to Khan fans though, so that might be why he sounded as he did. 
p5384
aVI really like how he's played it so far too. I just wish to hear him once he really put his own personality into it. I'm excited for what Kamelot has in store for us. 
p5385
aVTommy is actually a way better singer than Khan and does things he could never do (don't kill them, I freaking love Khan from the bottom of my heart and would probably kill someone to have seen him in concert). I can't wait to see what he can do on their next album.
p5386
aVI've been listening to pretty much everything by Kamelot on repeat for months. I lipsync to them with dramatic hand motions when my students come into the classroom. I think Ghost Opera is their favorite.\u000a\u000aMy first Kamlot song was "My Confession," took me forever to realize after I got all their music that I was listening to two different singers, though I can tell the difference pretty easily now.

p5389
aVSame here! This came up on Pandora about 10 years ago and introduced me to the entire genre.
p5390
aV[Therion - Rise of Sodom and Gomorrah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6kvKZtiNDY). Was talking to some random guy 5-6 years ago about how I didn't really like the 'screaming/growling' kind of metal, and he recommended this song and the band. Been hooked on symphonic metal ever since.
p5391
aVIt was definitely by E Nomine. I think it was "Wolfen (Das Tier in Mir)," but it may have been "Vater Unser."\u000a\u000aEither way, I still love the songs!
p5392
aV"Dawn of Victory" by Rhapsody of Fire (pre-name change). \u000ahttp://youtu.be/0L_iOnLNt9M\u000a\u000aI found them by accident. My siblings and I were looking up how to wavedash in Super Smash Bros. Melee, and found a video of two people, as Marth vs. Marth, having a wavedash battle. I can't find the video, but I'll never forget that moment as it changed my life. Too bad my siblings didn't grow attached.\u000a\u000aWhen I hear the song now, it doesn't quite have the same feeling as before - but I do get a massive nostalgia boner when it plays from shuffle. \u000a\u000aMy tastes have changed quite drastically since. I am more in-tuned with symphonic black/death/metalcore/deathcore (which I love to flood this subreddit with, excluding symphonic-metalcore and symphonic-deathcore. I know they don't belong in this subreddit).\u000a\u000a
p5393
aVFor me the first was Theatre of Tragedy' ["A hamlet for a slothfull vassal"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTHZvEl72Gc) (yes, I am old, and yes - it's more gothic than symphonic, but it was one of the first symphonic-like bands)\u000a\u000aThen Nightwish was a phase, but after Haggard' ["Awaking the centuries"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvYRYCIAKZo) I am fully into symphonic and a Haggard fan :)

Then I heard [Kamelot - March of Mephisto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0yYxOV-bRU) featuring Shagrath and I knew this was going to be something I would never grow tired of. I still love listening to that song except it just pains me that they couldn't keep the band together.

aVI recently got into symphonic metal, let alone metal. All i would listen to before symphonic metal was either Kamelot or Machinae Supremacy. Trying to get into new metal bands I knew I wasnt ready for the heavier stuff, but I heard of Epica before and decide to give it a try. \u000a\u000aHeard their new single Essence of Silence and was imediatly hooked. It is safe to say Epica is my favorite band with the my favorite song being "Chemical Insomnia"  followed by "Essence of Silence."

aVNightwish - Wish I Had An Angel. I was browsing my friend's music collection when I found it.\u000a\u000aI don't think I went seriously metal until I moved out of his place.\u000a\u000aCurrently I think it's okay, I don't listen to that much Nightwish any more but if it comes up on streaming radio, I'll listen.

aVOk. Symphonic Black metal is an acceptable label for this. My mistake. 
p5423
aVKeep in mind Symphonic Metal is a broader category under which narrower genres, like Symphonic Black/Death Metal, exist. Like how you'd have a genre category called "car", and within that you'd have sedan, coup, hatchback, etc. So it's not incorrect to call a narrower category by its parent category's moniker, just as it's fine to call a sedan a car.

p5499
aVFrom their coming album, Sacrificium, featuring their new singer Dianne Van Giersbergen after the departure of Manuela Kraller. \u000a\u000aHere's the band's blurb for the song:\u000a&gt;"DREAMKEEPER" represents the melodic side of "Sacrificium" and will be your 'first steps' into our new album! It will lure you into a much darker, heavier and more complex universum that will be revealed to you through the other \u201cSacrificium\u201d-songs!

p5506
aVDoes anyone have any thoughts on how they might execute the final product? I have two concerns based on what I'm seeing here. \u000a\u000aThe first is that the trailer didn't have even a demo version of something that would match the final audio based on the description. \u000a\u000aThe second is the gameplay and how it would work. I think that this is an idea worth exploring, but I'm having trouble imagining what a truly integrated video game and concept album would look like based on only the written/spoken description. IMHO the trailer didn't look much different from a plain old fashioned video game trailer. \u000a\u000aDoes anyone have any thoughts? Did I miss something on the page? Is there a similar idea floating around (or finished) that I should check out for a better idea?\u000a
p5507
aVI completely agree, I don't feel like I really understand anything about the gameplay from what they've said. I'm not entirely sure why they labelled the trailer as "gameplay" when that's not what it is at all. I always want to encourage these kinds of ideas but I don't think they've given out enough to make people really invest in it.\u000a\u000aI'm also rather wondering if the audience is big enough. Brutal Legend did fairly well as a game because it covered lots of aspects of rock and metal as well as being very funny and having a famous actor (Jack Black) in the lead. I struggle to see The Birdcage appealing to many people outside of symphonic metal fans.\u000a\u000aKarmaflow which was linked above is the only other similar idea that I know of. If you watch the videos it makes a bit more sense as to how the music is integrated into their game (basically the bosses singing the plot at you) but it shares the same problems with audience etc.

aVIt's a shame that Twin Flames isn't included on the European version! It's such a beautiful song, possibly even my favorite from RFTI.
p5514
aVTwin Flames is also my favorite from RFTI. In my opinion, the regular version is better than the soundtrack version.
p5515
aVI hadn't heard the regular version before, but I just found it on youtube. You're right, it is also really pretty. I think I prefer the soundtrack version more overall though, just because the orchestra part is a lot less "busy". I like the more laid back and chill feeling in the soundtrack version.
p5516
aVBy the "regular version", do you guys mean the one that was performed at Retrospect? None of the Twin Flames results on my youtube search distinguishes as to whether it's the soundtrack or regular versions.
p5517
aVWikipedia says the "regular version" was a bonus track on a certain version of the album, and that it was about 15 seconds shorter, so that's how I found it. Search for "twin flames epica" and look for one that's like 4:45 instead of 5:00.
p5518
aV[Found it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQd7mmE9mHY), thanks!\u000a\u000aI agree with your assessment - the soundtrack version sounds quite a bit cleaner and ends much more organically as well.

aV[Serenity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxt9iv1fyRI). that is all.
p5542
aVThank you! This is exactly what I was looking for.
p5543
aVKamelot's what I would consider straight-up power-symphonic metal. The singer's excellent (professionally opera trained, I believe) and his voice is around the tenor range. One of the best singers I've ever heard. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE6x2I1RoRk) a great example of the singer.\u000a\u000aRhapsody of Fire, mentioned elsewhere here, also has an excellent singer; they're that kind of fantasy-metal like Hammerfall and Dream Evil, although a lot more focused on the epic and symphonic aspect - you know, songs about dragons and mages and awesome shit like that. The singer's probably a high tenor, but not bad at all. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC5FMDjG6Mg) my favorite Rhapsody piece.\u000a\u000aDiablo Swing Orchestra bounces back and forth between some serious opera female and a more modern male; they also blend in elements of swing and Spanish fanfare or something in their music. Totally unique sound, but [very nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhYiANz5oeI).\u000a\u000aIf you're not too strict on the symphonic aspect, try [Falconer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCG01wfgzpQ). I fell in love after hearing the guy's voice; it's a low tenor or something like that I think, and he's a great singer, too.\u000a\u000ahope i helped c:
p5544
aVKamelot did recently change singers, but I'd say they still fit what OP is looking for.
p5545
aVI'm a little ashamed about this, but: had I not been informed that they switched from Roy to Tommy, I'd never have known that they'd changed. I mean, yes, now that I know they're two different people, I can pick out differences- Tommy's vibrato is different, his high notes are different, little things like that, but they're very similar indeed.\u000a\u000aSo, yes, still the same 'idea'. c:
p5546
aVI love Falconer. His voice is definitely unique and soothing. He also sounds great live.
p5547
aVMaybe Therion would fit this criteria? Seventh Wonder is male-fronted, but I don't think that's what you're after.

aVMusic sounds pretty good but the video is *incredibly* cheesy.
p5573
aVThere have definitely been worse from much bigger bands. It's an unfortunate outcome of our particular genre, it seems - relatively small bands with limited budgets tackling epic themes that are difficult to do justice to.
p5574
aVYeah, I think the worst I've seen was a trailer for the first Luca Turilli's Rhapsody. I guess maybe symphonic metal is a bit cheesy musically too so it's bound to happen.

VThey remain. Slightly less on the final After Forever album. She does them herself when performing live with ReVamp, and does them excellently! 
p5606
aV/u/ColumbosMissus already answered your question, but I'm curious; do you not like death grunts at all or just in symphonic metal? 
p5607
aVAt all, anymore. I was into death metal back in the early to mid-90's, though.
p5608
aVThey have plenty fantastic songs without any growls at all. For some good examples, check their 2004 Pinkpop gig, which is on Youtube.\u000a\u000aI personally absolutely love Life's Vortex, for instance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GneGW8d9viE\u000a\u000aEccentric. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSnziUz49hY&amp;list=UUPyvd5tLK9eZ_SdgonmQGDA\u000a\u000aAnd especially Through Square Eyes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjE1lSEzVU\u000a\u000a\u000aJust don't dismiss them too quickly judging by a few of their songs which have growls in them. Like I said, there's plenty for everyone. Also, please, please, check out Floor's current band, ReVamp. They already did two fantastic albums. The second has some growls too, but not too much (not every song), and she does them herself, too! It's also not really symphonic metal, but rather progressive I guess with some songs having some symphonic elements to them (like operatic singing). Their album "Wild Card" is one of the best female fronted metal albums I've ever heard, and I'm into this stuff since I was ~9 (which was about 15 years ago).
p5609
aVI will check out those things and while I haven't written them off, it's a bit of a pain to go through and delete all tracks with grunting. \u000a\u000a
p5610
aVThey did a poppy, easy listening album called Remagine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remagine). There's not a lot of grunting there, but it's not very symphonic either.\u000a\u000aTheir final album, self titled After Forever, is also low on grunts and a much better album in general (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Forever_(album)). Check out the song Dreamflight for clean male vocals.
p5611
aV*Remagine* is ok, but mostly because Floor does amazing in some songs. She really carries that album. I think *After Forever* is their best album, followed by *Invisible Circles*.

p5629
aVOceanborn is my favorite pre-annete album!
p5630
aVi prefer nightwish albums in the exact order they were released. which is why i eventually stopped listening.
p5631
aVI don't know why this happens so much, with almost every band...\u000a\u000aI like Annete's albums way more than I like Tarja's, but it seems like only 1% of nightwish fans feel the same way.
p5632
aVit has little to do with annette versus tarja. I felt like the first albums had more personnality and uniqueness than the last ones. Keep in mind i grew with them. I bought angels fall first before oceanborn was released. Got a lot of stuff from them. Hell I even have the The Carpenter single... all that drama within the band struck me as childish at the time, and their music kind of started to sound the same. It's still good, just feels a bit washed down.
p5633
aVI feel the exact opposite, although I also grew with the Tarja albums, to me, they now feel childish, simple, and almost incomplete, completely different from the Annete ones, which, for me, feel way fuller, more like complete works of art rather then just another normal song.\u000a\u000aI like the "Tarja era's" songs because I simply like the sound of them, but I LOVE the "Annete era's" songs because not only do I love the sound of them, but I also feel all the emotion from the song, and to me that is beautiful, (this isn't just because of the singer obviously, I feel like even the instrumentals pass way more feelings than previous ones).\u000a\u000aHave you watched the Imaginaerum movie? For me, the Imaginaerum album and movie together create the greatest piece of art that mankind has ever created, I don't even know how to describe the way I felt after watching that movie.
p5634
aVI always have a bit of cog-dis when listening to Nightwish - I love them to bits, but what their lead did to Tarja is still pretty shitty.

VI like both this and Elan (too lazy to figure out how to add the accent character, sorry).\u000a\u000aIt's different than anything Nightwish has done before, but I still hear a lot of what makes Nightwish great in this song. Can't wait for the full album. :)
p5654
aVThis is song is way better than Èlan in my opinion. Still too chorus-heavy for my tastes, but a good song nonetheless. 
p5655
aVthe problem with singles is from each of the albums sicne once there haven't been many tracks that work as standalone songs. The reason they did Eva for DPP and Storytime for Imaginarium is because they were the closest to that.\u000a\u000aSagan was obviously deemed as not good enough for the album so they kept it for the single release of elan. it is a more upbeat track.\u000a\u000aElan is probably the albums soft ballad. Liek slow love slow was on Imaginarium ( which to be honest is the only time i though anette did a better job than anyone i could think of to sing it.)
p5656
aVI prefer Èlan over Sagan.
p5657
aVthey are both good tracks.
p5658
aVWait, is this another leak or legitimate?

p5661
aVAfter hearing this and Elan. I don't think the new album is what I was hoping it would be.
p5662
aVI reserve judgement until i've heard the entire thing.
p5663
aVSo you're gonna draw conclusions over a generic single that a bunch of reviews have mentioned that it's not representative of the entire album and a bonus track that doesn't even belong in the album itself?
p5664
aVYeah, I tend to draw conclusions from my own experience with music, not what reviewers tell me to think. If there are bigger and more dramatic songs on the new album that I like, then yay for me. If not, then I guess I'll be disappointed, I can live with that, there is plenty more music out there that I am yet to enjoy. \u000aBut I will never let anyone tell me what I music I should and shouldn't like.
p5665
aVThen maybe go from a historical basis?\u000a\u000aThe singles from DPP were Amaranth, Eva and Bye Bye Beautiful, all of which were filler songs. The single for Once was Nemo.\u000a\u000aIt's not like Nightwish albums are known for lacking mainstream-friendly/filler songs.\u000a\u000aNot to mention that reviewers only give their opinions for the most part, not tell others what to think.
p5666
aVYou realize singles are there to make someone interested in an album, to give the listener a reason to buy their new album. Right? If that's the case, then Nightwish is doing a terrible job and I'll keep judging their album on what I hear of it. \u000a\u000aSeems like a moronic move of them to just go "hey here's our unimportant, crappy filler songs that doesn't really colour our album in any positive way at all or give you an example of what the album is about. Don't forget to buy our new album!"\u000a\u000aShit like this is the reason pirating is so big. At least bands are more open to streaming their full album when it's released, I hope Nightwish does the same or I'm not gonna buy it.\u000a\u000aFor the purpose of being on topic, I really dislike the softer rocky side Nightwish takes here. I really hope we're not seeing the complete exit from the metal world by Nightwish here. I've already lost In Flames, don't want to lose another band :/
p5667
aVYes, I am perfectly aware of that. However, realistically, that doesn't end up being the case. Vast majority of the time, the singles end up being the most generic, boring, filler songs with barely any redeeming or interesting elements, but catchy and accessible enough to play on TV and radio and to get some people interested.\u000a\u000aIt's pretty much never aimed at the existing fanbase (which usually already has high expectations by default), only at random people who might have a passing interest.\u000a\u000aThe exceptions to this trend are usually excellent albums with minimal/nonexistent filler and/or singles that happen to be great songs (relevant examples would be Storytime from Nightwish, The Essence of Silence and Unleashed from Epica).\u000a\u000aAnd yeah, I pirate every album I'm curious about. If I don't like it, I delete it, and if I do like it, I end up buying it. I even do this with albums I'm particularly hyped about (including the upcoming Nightwish album).\u000a\u000aI don't expect NW to do any full album streams though. That's usually up to the record label itself, and with Tuomas lately going on about the "mystery" of new albums being ruined by the internet and leaks, I think they want to avoid that sort of thing, honestly.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I wouldn't be afraid if I were you. A lot of the previews/reviews/first impressions of the album said the album is very diverse, Élan isn't really representative of the album and it's the weakest track, and the album itself concludes with a 24-minute beast of a track, which I'm especially excited about.\u000a\u000aSagan is good and Élan is nice but forgettable, but what I care about is the rest of the album and that epic long track at the end.

asVEpica - The Phantom Agony (Clip from Retrospect)

(lp5674
VThat was the most amazing thing I have seen for a long, long time. WHY WASN'T I THERE!?
p5675
aVSome may say (and I kinda agree) that Simone lost a bit of her voice while she was pregnant. But those headbangs are still godlike \u005co/
p5676
aVI, contrary to popular believe, think this (Retrospect) was one of Simone's worst performances. Her voice is simply not what it used to be. I saw them last November and her performance was rather mediocre; there wasn't much breath control, her tone was a bit too nasal, and she was sometimes off key. The whole Retrospect concept is great, but at least IMO, Simone's performance wasn't that great. Also the light/laser show could have been taken down a notch. \u000a\u000aEdit: Because I hate using my cellphone to comment.
p5677
aVI actually agree, her voice was so beautiful and now it seems she has lost it. People simply wanna believe this is because of her pregnancy more than believing symphonic metal has lost one of its queens :/\u000aBut I still believe I have never seen someone headbange in a more perfect way than she can.
p5678
aVHmm, I don't really have any evidence or musical experience to back this up, but I actually thought her singing on Retrospect was a lot better than the last time I saw her sing live.
p5679
aVI could be exaggerating out of disappointment. As I aforementioned, Retrospect was a great concept, I mean it was the 10 year anniversary! But for me what's really disappointing is that in those ten years Simone's singing technique has plummeted. Simone has one of the most beautiful mezzo-soprano lyric voices I've heard, but after she switched and started singing in a rockish manner, which apparently she can't support well, her live performances have gone downhill. Sorry if I might be over analyzing this, but I've been studying singing for a while now and it's just painful to see someone with a beautiful voice misuse it and potentially ruin it. 
p5680
aVShe definitely sounds like she struggles with her current style of singing. I've only really been a fan for about 5 years so I just thought she wasn't that good at singing live, but then when I watched some videos from The Phantom Agony era she sounded a lot better. I really like both styles of singing (Floor Jansen can switch between the two easily) so I have no problem with the style, but you're right, it doesn't sound like it's good for her voice.
p5681
aVEven in the [DYU](http://youtu.be/SfboLVmP2WM) era she was doing better than what she's been doing lately. Floor is a perfect example  of someone who is very disciplined and dedicated with her voice. She's constantly learning new ways and techniques of exploiting her voice, it's admirable. I guess Simone just needs more discipline, but with her new duty as a Mom, I'm not sure that's going to happen lol. 
p5682
aVIndeed, haha. Actually at the MFVF recently the only singer I heard warming up a lot backstage was Floor... I don't know if that means she's the only one doing it or perhaps more likely that she's the one with the best voice projection!

aVSorry for the delay. Here's the interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_JNbkxH3Uk&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
p5696
aV&gt;How did you decide on the characters/stories for SOTN? Certainly, they span a wide range, through time and space, but many of them are fairly obscure, with barely a page dedicated to them on Wikipedia. Most songs about female historical/folk figures usually stick to well-known characters such as Jeanne d'Arc or the Blood Countess Bathory, so for you guys to walk off the already barely-trodden path is quite notable!
p5697
aVSorry, I got mixed up. Live writes the lyrics and wasn't there, so I couldn't ask your question though it was touched on.

aVIt makes me sad that After Forever isn't around anymore. Aside from making some great music, they were so instrumental in the formation of symphonic metal as a genre! \u000a\u000aBut I love Mark in Epica and Floor in Nightwish and ReVamp, so a little bit of After Forever still carries on. 
p5706
aVI thought MaYan and Revamp are bands, not projects.

aVI would say MaYaN are a side project since it's the secondary band of most of the members, whereas I would consider ReVamp to be a complete band (even though Floor has now joined Nightwish).

asVWhat is the most original, atypical, symphonic metal song which nevertheless clearly belongs to the genre?
p5723
(lp5724
VTry Diablo Swing Orchestra! IMO it definitely fits symphonic metal although they use quite a bit of jazz as well in their songs. It's an interesting mix! \u000a\u000aBalrog Boogie is a fun song to start with that has some clear jazzy sounds. 
p5725
aV[Mechina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5z1vNDY0bw) because INTERGALACTIC SYMPHONIC INDUSTRIAL METAL
p5726
aVWhoa. That sounds awesome. I'm not digging the growls though. Do they have any instrumental songs? Or is there a band with similar music?
p5727
aVnot sure and i can't recommend much but nothing with clean vocals.. probably hard to find symphonic metal this extreme with primarily clean vox . it is cool though isn't it!
p5728
aVFor example, Within Temptation's song *[And We Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awvqIi427_A)* has a typical Within Temptation sound...and then suddenly there's rap music by Xzibit. (I don't like it very much, but that's not the point.)\u000a\u000aAnother example, and a much better song in my opinion, is Nightwish's *[Scaretale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnYrscO5eN8)*, where the circus music and Marco's parts create a unique sound.
p5729
aVHow about [Slow, Love, Slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElbyDZYeAzU)? It uses a lot of jazz elements but it still manages to fit Nightwish's style, especially towards the end when the other instruments come in.
p5730
aVI love the atmosphere in that song, but I didn't include it because I don't think it is metal. It's still an absolutely amazing song though.
p5731
aVI'm a huge fan of Slow, Love, Slow. I wish I could find more songs like it but as far as I can tell its extremely unique.
p5732
aVSonata Arctica's Cinderblox uses bluegrass influence. Very interesting. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Y7BjuLM5U
p5733
aV[Heilig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5xFSBH5PY) by Schlafes Bruder is definitely atypical, and if that isn't enough then there's [Schwarze Sonne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTimWOT5bA) by E Nomine, although that's borderline symphonic metal with more electronic elements than metal (and E Nomine is definitely not a metal band). Therion also has a great variety of weird stuff; [Close up the Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCiQx816OzE) from Gothic Kabbalah, [Birth of Venus Illegitima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o6lX_qdlLI) from Vovin and [The Flight of the Lord of Flies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f94dK4RkkC4_) from Deggial all being prime examples. Diablo Swing Orchestra have a bunch of weird and wonderful songs as well, but they're not exclusively symphonic metal.
p5734
aVUnbesiegt by Equilibrium off of sagas.  It has a Peruvian melodic line, an accordion and German growling vocals sung in German.  It is a very strange, but really cool song.  I have never heard anything like it.  \u000a\u000aSome people may not consider it symphonic, but honestly, I can't think of any other metal genre that it would fit into. 
p5735
aVIf you like Diablo Swing Orchestra try Unexpect. Their music is very eccentric and their first few albums are more of an acquired taste because of this. Their newest album however is a bit easier to listen to. My favorite tracks by them are Unfed Pendulum, Chromatic Chimera, and The Quantum Symphony.

p5773
aVGreat list! Thanks for compiling it!\u000a\u000aThe only major (3 or more studio albums) bands I would like to see added would be Almora (probably the only major Turkish band out there), Turisas (who doesn't love epic tales of the Vikings' adventures in Byzantium?), Coronatus (two sopranos are better than one!), and Dark Moor (their cover of Vivaldi's Winter got me into the whole genre).
p5774
aVHow have I never heard of coronatus? They sound awesome! Thank you. 
p5775
aVThanks for the suggestions! I have Turisas down in the "see also" list because there were already so many mentions for T and they actually said on Reddit that they didn't consider themselves symphonic, but I thought they should be in there somewhere. I'll look into the others and get them in there too.
p5776
aVWhats your opinion on Lacrimas Profundere ?\u000a\u000aThey have some symphonic roots, but can never say if they are more gothic or symphonic :/
p5777
aVHmm, yeah, I see what you mean there. I'd put them under gothic metal (a quick check of their Facebook says they classify themselves as that as well). Their later stuff sounds a bit like HIM. But there's definitely symphonic influences in there I would say. Might add them to the "see also" section!
p5778
aVLove it, glad to see Van Canto on that list. Now excuse me I have the urge to create an A-Z playlist now.

p5796
aVThis is my reaction in a nutshell. "A continuation of Kingdom of Heaven from DYU? Did I read that right?"\u000a\u000aMy hype for this album is over the moon right now.
p5797
aVReally?  I'm surprised people feel this way.  I love Epica, and I really enjoyed DYU, but Kingdom of Heaven is, in my opinion, easily the weakest track on that album.  I found that song to be overwrought, repetitive, boring and really just felt long for the sake of being long.  It's 14 minutes that frankly should have been 9 or 10.  And it's not the length itself that bothers me, it's that there are stretches of that length that simply go nowhere, and as a result just can't hold my attention.  \u000a\u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, I'm really looking forward to the new album.  I've been a fan for years and love the direction they're going - I'm sure it will be wonderful.  Just not a fan of that one song.

aVWelp, guess there's no choice but the get the 3-CD version...
p5799
aVI really love those mediabook things. They look great on the shelf and don't break like the jewel cases always do. I hope I can get every album in that format from now on.
p5800
aVIf only local stores stocked more than just the basic jewel case versions of releases. Ordering online adds so much more shipping and currency conversion fees that it ends up being nearly 50% more than buying it from a store, not to mention shipping time from Europe, which is longer than simply waiting out the difference in release dates for North America.\u000a\u000aBut I guess I'll make an exception for this one!
p5801
aVI don't suppose ordering from Nuclear Blast USA is any better? My only experience of them was when I ordered their special edition of Imaginaerum, and it was good value even with shipping to the UK. But that was a one-off situation I guess.
p5802
aVI'm not sure - my last Epica order was from CM Distro before they stopped stocking them, and that was for Requiem. The CD price was nice, at $11, but the shipping was $6.40! Add the USD to CAD conversion on top of that and it's around $20 for just a regular single-disc jewel case. That wouldn't be so bad (since I got Leaves' Eyes' SotN from the local store for $19), but the shipping time meant it didn't get to me until a week or so after the NA release date. \u000a\u000aStill, not much of a choice!

sVNo decision on Nightwish singer yet but Floor is "top of the list"
p5861
(lp5862
VI'm torn here.  One one hand Floor is an amazing singer and meshes well with Nightwish.  On the other hand, ReVamp is great, and I'd hate to see that stall or falter because of her NW obligations.
p5863
aVSame, I'm hoping if she did join that she'd keep up with ReVamp. I mean, the guys have other bands and side projects too, so it's definitely not out of the question!
p5864
aVImagine a ReVamp/Tarot/Nightwish tour.  How epic would that be?
p5865
aVBut imagine all of the work Floor would have to put in with both bands!
p5866
aVI don't understand what Tuomas has to think so much, I mean get it out of the way and move on. Floor has expressed her willingness to be the full time singer and most of the fans are very pleased with Floor's amazing vocal abilities. If he lets Floor go, I'm pretty sure there will be another rumbling similar to when Tarja was fired. 
p5867
aVWell, "I don't want to think about it yet" is a perfectly valid reason to not think about it yet. They don't need to make a decision right now if they don't want to; they don't have a deadline they have to meet in the near future. \u000a\u000aIt would be worse for them to say "Yeah, Floor will be with us officially" now and then have to back out of that in a year, for whatever reason. If the decision is not made, it is not made.
p5868
aVWhoa what happened to Annette?
p5869
aVShe left the band in October last year after getting pregnant with her 3rd child. There were obviously tensions within the band and she was struggling to cope with touring. She also got very ill and had to go to hospital and miss a show, and was angry that the band continued without her. Shortly after they had a mutual split, and Floor Jansen (from After Forever and ReVamp) has been filling in ever since. They've recorded some live videos with her and also filmed a DVD at Wacken which will be out around Christmas.\u000a\u000aAnette has been off having her baby and getting married, and she's working on a solo album.\u000a\u000a[Official video of Floor singing Ghost Love Score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brcfttchzA)
p5870
aVThey'll drag it out a bit longer so they get more publicity for the next album closer to the time, I'm under the impression it's a while off due to other projects. 
p5871
asVNarwhal Tusk (really good Russian Symphonic Metal band), Whyzdom (French Symphonic Metal) and Tristania (my favorite Gothic Metal band, Darkest White has to be the best album of the year). Just 3 bands on my playlist right now :)

p5876
asVBest bands/albums for fans of Epica's lyrics?
p5877
(lp5878
VAfter Forever's early work is EXTREMELY similar to Epica (Mark Jansen was actually in After Forever before he founded Epica). If you are looking for more Epica-like material, it doesn't get any closer than their first two albums *The Prison of Desire* and *Decipher*. Mark even wrote the lyrics to a lot of the songs too.\u000a\u000aYou can also look at Mark's side project MaYaN. It's more different musically, but the political lyrics will interest you! 
p5879
aVCan definitily recommend After Forever too, love all their albums. Other bands in the symphonic genre with this feeling? I don't think any other bands come as close as these 2. When looking at a genre a bit alike, progressive metal, there are lots of bands with this feeling. Dream Theater, Ayreon indeed(can be described as opera-metal, cause it has an opera set-up with like 6 famous singers featuring an album, very epic indeed) and many more can be found to have very well written and good lyrics.
p5880
aVI agree, MaYaN has similar but more aggressive lyrics to Epica... Regarding After Forever, Decipher is probably their best album and has some of the "political" stuff in it. "Prison of Desire" has a little of the religion/politics stuff but is not the album I recommend starting out with as they were not at the level of musicianship as with Decipher. You may also like AF's third album Invisible Circles... much more personal, but still protest... basically an opera about an abused child and her family, but metal as heck and quite progressive. 
p5881
aVThey are very different bands, but I like Ayreon and Alisse White-Gluz's work (recent Arch Enemy, and before that, The Agonist.) Not quite Atheist Metal, but Ayreon has the "project" feel that Epica has, and AE/TA are political, in ways sometimes that might be as controversial as Epica's, to the right audience. And there's Otep, who's that to more of an extreme, and she can be uncomfortable to listen to if you're a carnivorous middle-class white dude.
p5882
aVOoh, and I forgot to mention Delain. Their lyrics aren't as strong as other bands, and their politics don't seem controversial to me, but they've definitely got that energy.
p5883
aVBest Delian album, IYO?
p5884
aVWe Are The Others and The Human Contradiction are both good and equal enough in my mind. They've really grown as a band, so for a new listener, I'd suggest THC... :)\u000a\u000aLucidity was a concept album, it's good, but it doesn't sound like modern Delain to me. Love the Liv Kristine vocals though.\u000a\u000aApril Rain is good, too, but it doesn't have the emotional charge of the later albums, and I think Lucidity was better from a technical perspective.
p5885
aVTheir latest, *The Human Contradiction*, is by far my favourite!
p5886
aVLike others have mentioned, early After Forever and MaYaN were/are both led by Mark Jansen, so there's a lot of similarity there, especially in the lyric department.\u000a\u000aAnother band I also recommend is Orphaned Land. I still haven't listened to much from them, but their latest album, All Is One, is pretty great, and it's reminiscent of Epica in both sound and lyrics, but still very different.
p5887
aVI'm not that familiar with Within Temptations lyrical themes, but I think [Deceiver of Fools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj_KUKzGY08) may fit your discription.

aVWondering if the person above didn't realise they were in r/symphonicmetal. We even have a picture of Sharon in the banner, I think it's safe to say there's many WT fans here.
p5891
aVThat's what I thought but than I suddenly didn't care anymore. Maybe he really didn't realise he was in /r/symphonicmetal or he was just trolling. But I really have had enough of this "this aint metal blah blah". There was/is enough of this BS in /r/powermetal.

VThey just released The Quantum Enigma, which is fantastic. My personal favorite is probably The Divine Conspiracy though.\u000a\u000a[Fools of Damnation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csYBwZPCleY) - My favorite off The Divine Conspiracy\u000a\u000a[Second Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMkyWaYwBA) - From the Quantum Enigma, probably becoming my favorite Epica song of all time
p5908
aVIn my opinion, Design Your Universe is absolutely unbeatable as an album. It is for sure my favorite album by Epica, and probably my even my favorite album of all time by any artist. That being said, The Quantum Enigma comes damn close. I think that Requiem for the Indifferent was their weakest album overall, but I still loved over half of the songs on it. And the other three (The Phantom Agony, Consign to Oblivion, and The Divine Conspiracy) all have very unique sounds from each other and are wonderful in their own ways.\u000a\u000aMy advice is to listen to their entire discography. Chances are you won't regret it. :)
p5909
aVAll of their later albums are great, but the early stuff isn't bad either. My favourite Epica album at the moment is *The Quantum Enigma*, which was released this year. *The Divine Conspiracy*, *Design Your Universe*, and *Requiem for the Indifferent* are all great too.\u000a\u000aTheir earliest albums have some really good stuff, but they're not as good as the later ones. Simone's voice has noticeably improved over time and so have the overall writing and production.\u000a\u000aHere are two amazing songs from the latest album: [The Essence of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oePrtEMmX9Y) and [Unchain Utopia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8y99z5EVtY).
p5910
aVThey are all amazing, I personally find their last album to be the least good. Design your universe is by far the best, the song and the album, and Requiem for the Indifferent is GREAT, containing the only song that can compete with Design your universe, Serenade of Self-Destruction. \u000a\u000aI personally find these two albums masterful in comparison to their other albums.
p5911
aVSo, this wasnt meant as a reaction to stefankruithof (u dutch?) but to OP, sry for misplacement 
p5912
aVNo I'm not Dutch but I like hearing songs in other languages and looking up the translation online. 
p5913
aVI am Dutch though :-)
p5914
aVthought so cause of ur name, me too, going to epica in Utrecht next month :D
p5915
aVTheir latest 3 albums are the best ones, I think, with The Quantum Enigma being superior to the other 2.
p5916
aVPersonally, Requiem for the Indifferent is my favourite. It is probably their most progressive album and I am a huge prog fan so that is probably why it is my favourite. If I were you I would start at The Phantom Agony and eventually work your way up to The Quantum Enigma because all of their albums are great in their own way.
p5917
aVFinally someone who agrees that RFTI is the best... but really, Epica is the only band where I like almost every song on every album. 
p5918
aVMy favorite is Design Your Universe, but The Divine Conspiracy holds a special place in my heart for being one of the (if not THE) very first Symph. Power Metal albums I ever got into as a whole, instead of just songs here-and-there.\u000a\u000aBest song from The Divine Conspiracy in my opinion is [Chasing the Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWQAIO9CdFk). Very slow and progressively builds up to an insanely powerful climax, and shows off Simone's voice very well.
p5919
aVLike BadWolf89 said, I think you should listen to their entire discography.  All of their albums are worth listening to, and each of them has a unique sound. And if you liked Kingdom of Heaven, I'd say also check out [Consign to Oblivion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVDKjeI4__M) ( I mean the song, but you should also check out the whole album :P ).
p5920
aVAgreed. Consign to Oblivion has long been my favorite Epica album, but The Quantum Enigma is trying really hard to take its place. 
p5921
aVI think The Divine Conspiracy is still my favorite. I haven't listened to The Quantum Enigma yet, though.
p5922
aVMy favorite is Requiem for the Indifferent... it stays dark, heavy, and progressive til the end. The only real drawback is the mixing/mastering is not as good as their other albums. However, as others have said, all the albums are definitely worth a listen. RFTI takes the longest to fully appreciate, and CTO is probably the easiest to get into. I don't like a couple of the songs on their newest album, such as "Unchain Utopia" and "Omen", plus most of "Reverance" even though the intro and verses are excellent, the chorus is just too repetitive. However, TQE has the best mastering of any of their albums and probably the best performance, instruments, and singing of any of their albums. Still, all of them are good. The closest to DYU is probably RFTI but as I have said, it is a lot darker. 
p5923
aVI am relativly new to Epica. So far my favorite album is the Quantum Enigma. Best songs are Chemical Insomnia, and Essence of Silence. :D
p5924
aVYou basically have their best album, although I have to echo what everyone is saying about Quantum Enigma. Good stuff there.\u000a\u000aOther than that, I recommend Cosign to Oblivion, then the following (which is personal opinion);\u000a\u000aPhantom Agony &gt; Divine Conspiracy &gt; Requiem for the Indifferent

VSymphony X. I've tried my best,  but I just can't get into them. I don't know what I'm not getting. 
p5941
aVHave you tried the song "The Odyssey"? It's long, but it single handedly got me into music. 
p5942
aVI have not! I'll check it out as soon as I can. 
p5943
aVone cannot simply have an opinion on symphony x without listening to the divine wings of tragedy and the odyssey.. 
p5944
aVThe song didn't make sense until I got to the last few minutes and I was like... HECK YEAH! 
p5945
aVTo be fair, Symphony X is more progressive/neoclassical metal than they are symphonic metal
p5946
aVDiabulus In Musica, Sirenia and Leaves' Eyes. They all sound like they have potential, but there's always something that I can't put my finger on that sounds off. I'd hesitantly add Kamelot to this list as well, but I've not really given them enough of a listening to.
p5947
aVI really like Sirenia, but the band can be very different from one album to the other (they changed singer a lot). Maybe try a few songs from a few different albums! My favorite album of theirs is An Elixir for Existence.
p5948
aVSirenia's got a strange sound because, while their music is very heavy (for a symphonic gothic band), they have this almost poppy melodic sound to their songs as well. I couldn't get into An Elixir for Existence, but Perils of the Deep sounds pretty good so far.
p5949
aVSee, I started off the same. Sometimes it's just not the right time. I immediately got into Leaves' Eyes when I found out they were talking about Vikings and all the fun stuff, and my first song by them was Ankomst which randomly played on pandora for me.\u000aSirenia took a bit longer since it's really poppy with Ailyn, but she's come a long way. The Perils of the Deep Blue is an excellent album though- I bought it on a whim and fell in love with it. Ailyn can sing really beautifully and she's been working to get to where she is now. Their sound has changed a bit. Old work by them is still pretty good.\u000aDiabulus In Musica... I needed to come back to them. They took a while. I hesitantly got into them too, but Blazing a Trail really hooked me. Argia--their latest album is pretty good and has a nice balance between an airy feel and heavy metal.\u000aWhatever it is, don't force yourself into the music. In my case, I always found a second listen several years later works.
p5950
aVSt. Micheal's Nightmare and Ex Nihilo got me into DIM... I like Argia and it's mastered very well... 
p5951
aVDefinitely Within Temptation for me, too. 
p5952
aVI agree. I can understand that a lot of people like them, and it's not that it's bad music; it just doesn't appeal to me. I've listened to everything they've put out, and I can't tell you one song that stood out to me.
p5953
aVAhhh but Kamelot! Black Halo and Epica drew me in, Ghost Opera didn't do quite as much but still held alot of feels.  Other albums, not so much.  \u000a\u000aOther bands that took me awhile to get used to -- Opeth, Sonata Arctica (not sure how much those two qualify as symph metal though)
p5954
aVThe band I've always struggled to get into was Within Temptation, i always loved angels and ice queen but could never really manage to get into their other stuff. Can you guys suggest any songs similiar to those two?
p5955
aVTherion, with the sole exception of Secret of the Runes, I just can't seem to get into them.  I really like Secret of the Runes though.\u000a\u000aSame thing for Within Temptation for me, while I don't mind their stuff, the only album I listen to by them consistently is The Unforgiving.  Everything else just doesn't resonate with me I guess.
p5956
aVNightwish. During Tarja's time, that is.\u000a\u000aI've listened to Ghost Love Score and Nemo. Doesn't impress me...
p5957
aVTry songs from Nightwish's power metal phase: Wishmaster, Fantasmic, Crownless, Stargazers. \u000a\u000aIn my opinion, Tarja's operatic vocals suit their earlier sound better - fast, glorious, anthem-like. When they slowed it down a bit in Ghost Love Score and Nemo, Nightwish became more goth and sulky, and they lost this 'uplifting effect' their songs had. You'll know what I mean once you hear Wishmaster. 
p5958
aVJust listened to all of them, and I found Wishmaster and Fantasmic a bit meh. Crownless was brilliant. Stargazers somewhere in between.\u000a\u000a
p5959
aVGive Wanderlust a listen then. \u000a\u000aAfter that, listen to the band Pythia. I think you might like them more than Nightwish. 
p5960
aVWill do! And definitely hoping their new album (when it comes out) wins me over.
p5961
aVI have yet to hear anything from them that I haven't liked. They are actually my favorite band.
p5962
aVI am the same. I like some of it but it's definitely not my favorite. 
p5963
aVTarja's voice is too operatic for my tastes, I think. Can certainly see why she's a great vocalist, but I prefer the voices of Sharon den Adel/Simone Simons/Charlotte Wessels over hers.
p5964
aVI say give Siren a listen. It's probably their best one with Tarja--IMO--and just has a creepy feel to it that works.
p5965
aVXandria/After Forever/Therion.\u000a\u000aTBH I think it's more about just taking the time to listen to them enough. \u000a\u000aOn the flip side I love Kamelot (pre poison) and a bunch of WT stuff.
p5966
aVI've never been a fan of After Forever's early albums, but the self-titled one is by far the best, especially Dreamflight and Empty Memories where Floor can really show off her voice.
p5967
aVI absolutely love Decipher. It was bit odd at first because of the 'ethnic' instruments and everything, but she's got some awesome high notes- Monolith of Doubt, My Pledge of Allegiance #1, Intrinsic.I also love the use of oboe on the album.\u000a\u000asuper excited to hear the new Nightwish album with Floor as lead.
p5968
aVI lied. I actually enjoyed a few songs on their selftitled album. 
p5969
aVTherion is quite a difficult band to get into, especially if you've already listened to a lot of more recent symphonic metal. Unlike most bands, Therion don't usually go for the bombastic "epic metal" sound of bands like Nightwish, Epica, Rhapsody, Blind Guardian etc. and don't have the more accessible sound of bands like Delain and Within Temptation. Although I now consider Therion to be my favourite band, I hated every one of their albums on the first listen through. I'm not quite sure what it is that makes Therion's sound so appealing to me and it's difficult to recommend a starting point because their more "accessible" stuff (in Therion terms) is generally considered their worst and everything else is kinda weird. I think they're a band that you have to listen to whole albums at a time to appreciate their music to begin with as individual songs don't really give you a full idea of what they're like.
p5970
aVTo me it's more of a time thing. I haven't taken the time to actually listen to any Therion album through. Everytime a song will shuffle onto my ipod, I'll skip. I'll definitely try to make an effort in the near future. 
p5971
aVThe main problem with Therion in my opinion is their inconsistency. Some of their songs or even albums are really disappointing, while other songs and albums are masterpieces. 
p5972
aVLove Kamelot, too... except for Poison. Everything before, and Silverthorn (which is after), are awesome.
p5973
aVDon't know if you have listened to Xandria's latest, but before this new singer, I couldn't get into them. But with the new singer I absolutely love the new album.
p5974
aVI actually hung out with Xandria and Delain after their show in Calgary. Went to a pub til like 3am lol. Dianne didn't come out tho. But yeah I like a few of their songs on their newer albums but haven't really taken the time to truly appreciate them. 
p5975
aVI wanted to meet them after the Orlando show, but it was so cold in the venue and I have some spinal problems that get worse when cold, I was hurting too bad to hang around. I regret not getting to meet them. :( I was totally blown away by their performance. Never liked Xandria until that show.
p5976
aVI agree. My order for favourite performance that night would be Xandria then Delain then Sonata Arctica 
p5977
aVOh yeah, Xandria stole the show. After Nightfall my dad and I both looked at each other with jaws dropped. Yeah I go to concerts with my dad. Only person I know with the same music tastes as me. :p\u000a\u000aI was disappointed in Delain though, but that is only because Charlotte's vocals don't project very well and they didn't have her mic turned up enough to compensate. Still enjoy seeing them live. Hoping to see her and Marco on stage together next year. :)
p5978
aVEpica's early albums. Their 3 or 4 most recent albums I like, but I don't care for their older stuff.
p5979
aVDelain. Liv Kristine's solo stuff. I can't get really into Theatre of Tragedy, but I love Leaves Eyes, WT, Revamp, AF.
p5980
aVHave you listened to Liv's latest album? It's pretty different to her previous ones.
p5981
aVNo I havent, i'll look into it.
p5982
aVTherion, Kamelot, Delain (excluding THC which is awesome). Also WT, but I think the problem there is that the music is too simple and not heavy enough... I like an isolated few Kamelot and Therion songs, but have found it hard to like the bands in their entirety. I think the Kamelot lyrics and singing style often get too whiny even though the singer is obviously good. Therion is just hard to get into period and I think a lot of people will agree on that! \u000a\u000aMy favorites are Epica, After Forever, MaYaN, Nightwish, Diabulus in Musica, Dark Moor, and Symphony X (like about half of their stuff). 
p5983
aVSirenia and Symphony X. I don't know why, my husband absolutely loves S-X, but I just can't get the two of them. ::shrug::
p5984
aVEpica. I like the orchestral half of The Classical Conspiracy, but I've never really been able to get into them. 
p5985
aVI was wondering if anyone would mention Epica.\u000a\u000aHave you tried The Quantum Enigma? 
p5986
aVNo, but I've heard good things about it. 
p5987
aVTotally give TQE a try. If not, well you tried and it's just not for you. We all have that one band.
p5988
aVTheir album Consign to Oblivion hooked me... I couldn't understand DYU and RFTI until like the third or fourth listen... of course now I love those albums. 
p5989
aVWithin Temptation and Leaves Eyes are the two big ones for me.\u000a\u000aI started listening to WT when The Heart of Everything came out at a friend's recommendation and I was on the fence at best. Even their older stuff felt boring and I didn't get why everyone was into them. It didn't help that I was told to basically stay away from any of their material after The Heart of Everything, which I did after reading reviews that they were becoming more "alt-rock" than symphonic.\u000a\u000aLeaves Eyes I purchased Njord and after a few listens, maybe 2 songs stuck with me. Wasn't keen on the growling (odd since I love After Forever and Epica) but this one didn't do it for me. None of their other material ever caught on with me either, so it became a "not recommended" band for me.
p5990
aVIn my description, I also forgot to include Delain in that list. Just can't get into them. They seem a bit bland to me.
p5991
aVI was like that too, and I think some of their music is still. For some reason though, I just had to listen to more after hearing Where's The Blood. Some songs are definitely way better than others.
p5992
aVlol i saw them live recently after not being able to get into the videos. It didn't help.
p5993
aVA lot of the bands I thought I couldn't get into have actually become my all-time favourites! It took me ages to get into Nightwish, Epica, Leaves' Eyes... I think Within Temptation were one of the few bands I've instantly loved on first hearing.\u000a\u000aThese days, I struggle with Therion, Kamelot, Stream of Passion, and most After Forever - except their final album. There's quite a lot of the smaller symphonic metal bands that I also find it hard to love. I think my taste has been spoiled by bands with more experience and/or bigger budgets.

VAm I the only one who thinks that "The Quantum Enigma" is one of the best symphonic metal albums ever? \u000aI've never been a huge Epica fan. I liked most of their stuff and loved some of their most famous songs, but there was something in their sound that didn't catch my attention as much as other bands did. TQE, though, blew my mind. I've listened to the whole album several times and I still can't get enough of it, it's fantastic.
p6003
aVSome quick google searches will reveal that you're not the only one.
p6004
aVI know this is a few days old, but...\u000a\u000aI'm a long time fan of Epica, and still the album was an immense surprise to me. I never thought Epica could get any better, but this album was honestly some of the best music I've ever heard in my life. I'm glad that it's bringing more people to Epica. Try out Design Your Universe now, it's quite close to this album in terms of music, composition and themes, and it blew my mind when it came out.

aVThis is my least liked song on the album, and I still think it kicks ass.

aVAwesome stuff man, I like it! Coincidentally I was just looking around youtube today to see if anyone had done a metal remix of any of her songs that kept the violin track, and came up with nothing. This is exactly what I was looking for, thanks for sharing!
p6010
aVHell yeah! :) I'm glad I could fulfill that for you! I'll have to make a play through video for youtube.
p6011
aVJust ... wow ! She's one of the only artists I've been following besides symphonic metal bands, and you did a great job combining both !

p6020
aVActually, it is different. Gloryhammer's sound caters to the programmed orchestral tracks into the background - like most (if not, all) symphonic metal bands do. They fit into this subreddit because of that. Dragonforce doesn't have the symphonic/orchestral sound to them, despite using synths in their songs.

VThere's already been hundreds of responses, way more than the dozens I expected! I hope to present all the data this weekend. I'll have to count/summarize all the open questions by hand, so that may take a while.
p6029
aVYou actually inspired me to do a survey over at /r/progmetal. I used some of your questions and added some of my own. It was only open for a couple of days because it wasn't stickied and I still got 577 responses! Having already parsed all of the data I can tell you that the text answers will take you quite a while, but all of the multiple choice and checklist ones were pretty simple, especially if you're familiar with excel or a similar program. If you want to check out the results and see how I presented the data, you can check it out here: https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2m0vri/rprogmetal_survey_results/

aVThat's great! I was myself inspired by a survey in /r/tolkienfans\u000a\u000aI considered some of the questions you're asking (like what instruments people play, if any), but eventually cut them. Maybe next year, if surveys become a regular thing!

VYes!\u000a\u000aThis song is a masterpiece. It's just mindblowingly beautiful and chill-inducing. I love symphonic doom-y stuff, and early Tristania and Sirenia are great examples of this.\u000a\u000aThe song is reminiscent of their older style to some degree, and it's one of the main reasons why I love their latest album.

VFuck yes. I hope they mix it up a little though, the new songs on Interlude were pretty meh, and her voice is too amazing to be wasted like that.
p6051
aVAfter they were messed around so much by their old label, I was glad to see them joining Napalm. I would guess that this will be a more metal album and the cover and tracklisting certainly give that impression. They also said last time around that the label asked them not to work with Marco Hietala, but the band told him he could be on the next album. So hopefully Marco will return!
p6052
aVWoohoo, they'll be able to perform it live in the September tour!
p6053
aVI'm seeing them support Within Temptation on April 12th. I'm so glad the album is coming out before I see them live. Live metal gigs are so loud and bassy I can't really hear the music unless I already know the songs well. [See an old post of mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/symphonicmetal/comments/ril2o/delain_announce_release_date_for_new_album_we_are/c463t5g) about how I declined to see Delain's headline show before We Are The Others came out. Anyone feel the same way?
p6054
aVIf it's another "angry tween" album then I think I'll pass. Hope they go back to "April Rain" days instead of forcing pseudo-anthems like "We Are the Others".

aVAs someone who loves Draconian and sadly couldn't attend the festival, can you tell me how did Heike do? I've found two videos on youtube and she sounded nice. What are your impressions? Is she good enough to fill the hole created after Lisa's departure?
p6080
aVI'm sorry you couldn't attend! Honestly, I thought she sounded lovely. I think her voice is quite close to Lisa's although not exactly the same - so I think she's a great choice. \u000a\u000aShe was apparently really ill with the flu just before the show and some people have been saying she sounded bad because of it, but I didn't particularly notice that. Perhaps it's more obvious on the recordings. But anyway, I wouldn't blame her for that, she clearly has a nice voice and I'm sure she won't have any problems when she's feeling better.
p6081
aVThank you for this response. I like her previous work and really hope she will fit in with the rest of the crew both vocally and on stage.
