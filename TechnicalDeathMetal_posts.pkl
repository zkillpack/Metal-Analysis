VHey guys, I have a few friends in the music business.. and some ''little more than rumors'' have popped up about The Faceless breaking up soon. Just be prepared. I don't know if they are 100% true or just B.S., but if they are touring near you SEE THEM NOW. It may be your last chance. I've heard a lot of them, some from some people who have toured/are touring with them.

It's a shame this happens, so I decided to take action and I created /r/metal101, a place where you can have any questions you may have answered or perhaps, impart knowledge on some youngsters trying to learn more about metal. I hope you can subscribe and create a large community where people can learn about and explore this wonderful genre we all love.

VI posted the Beyond Creation post not too long ago and you guys threw a lot of great bands my way. I'm back looking for something along those lines but much for.... Aggressive? I was listening to old music I used to listen to in middle school ( Suicide Silence mostly. Hey. We all transition into the big stuff differently. ) And on one particular song ," Eyes Sewn Shut ", there was a point where the bass line just hit me. It's a common technique used in Tech Death but I don't know what it's called. If you can't hear it in that song, it's very prevalent in a lot of Brutal Death Metal songs such as Goemagot's " Bigotry ". Here's how the technique is normally executed:\u000a\u000a1. Fast playing with higher BPMs than usual\u000a2. All music ceases for a fraction of a second\u000a3. Bass guitar drops a riff\u000a4. Slam or solo ( Normally, or and even high BPM )\u000a\u000aThis technique delivers the music in a fashion that I /really/ ( mobile. Can't italicize. ) enjoy. I'm versatile when it comes to death metal of course but if you guys could limit yourselves to bands like; Abominable Putridity, Kyojin Daigyakusatu, Extermination Dismemberment, Origin, Brain Drill, Monumental Torment, that'd be great.

Is Beyond Creation one of those bands that we'll just never find again? I'm no novice to death metal but through all of my years, I've yet to find a band that utilizes the Bass Guitar like Beyond Creation does. I'm basically asking for one opinion and a few suggestions . Is Beyond Creation a definite one of a kind band ? And is there a band that uses the Bass Guitar like they do ( Just very prominent throughout their album . ) ?

Still, here are four well-esteemed death metal bands, each of whom scrapped the low death growls for a higher pitched style of singing. Anyone else noticed this and is bothered when bands do it?

sVArchspire, super tech angry death metal fans?
p576
VWhat do you think of Archspire? Their album was one of my favorites this year. I wish more tech bands could pull off great song structure along with super-fast noodling. I really don\u2019t feel like there is one weak spot in this band besides the occasional inhale guttural type vocals, which would be better if they were exhale (nothing against inhales, but exhales would sound more intense IMO, but this is also being super picky). Plus, the music itself is brutal and not super atmospheric like a lot of death metal bands have been doing lately. Atmosphere is cool, but I personally like things angrier I guess :). Anyone know of albums that are similar to this?

sVFavorite metal counterpoint? (x-post from r/metal)
p632
VCounterpoint (multiple voices interdependent in harmony but independent in rhythm and contour) is one of my favorite musical devices, and I'm looking for good examples in really heavy music.\u000a\u000aYes, theory is pretty anal about counterpoint having skips, certain intervals, tritones, etc. but those rules are centuries old and had choral music in mind. Dissonance is an important part of metal anyway, so I'm not worried about those. Really I'm just looking for interesting pairs (or more) of different melodies.\u000a\u000aTwo examples I find particularly inspiring are [Anata's "Renunciation"](http://youtu.be/nmUpX_YnTIg?t=2m9s) and [Obscura's "Septuagint"](http://youtu.be/snDfSqcPHWk?t=4m32s).

I mean stuff with ridiculous amounts of pinch harmonics, spazzy time and tempo changes, but that still maintains some sense of groove. And the more slams the better!\u000a\u000aFor example, stuff along the lines of the following:\u000a\u000a* Malignancy - [Inhuman Grotesqueries](http://willowtip.bandcamp.com/album/inhuman-grotesqueries)\u000a* Embryonic Devourment - [Fear of Reality Exceeds Fantasy](http://embryonicdevourment.bandcamp.com/album/the-fear-of-reality-exceeds-fantasy)\u000a* Guttural Secrete - [Nourishing the Spoil](http://metalhit.bandcamp.com/album/nourishing-the-spoil) &lt;---NSFW\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks!

sVEvan Brewer addresses absence from current Tour with The Faceless
p686
VReddit made internet news on metal news site Metalsucks earlier this week, and now that news had made the way down to bassist Evan Brewer, who responded to questions of his absence from The Faceless's current tour supporting Between the Buried and Me. From Sumerian Record's facebook:\u000a\u000aEvan Brewer checked in to address his absence from The Faceless during their current tour with Between The Buried And Me\u000a\u000a "I'm sure many of you have become aware of the fact that I have not been out with The Faceless on their current tour. I've been using this time to explore a potential musical opportunity that has presented itself. Initially we didn't feel the need to say anything because we thought it was only going to be a couple of shows missed but, due to the circumstances, it became apparent that it would be better for them to finish the tour without me. I am not looking to quit the band, merely exploring an opportunity and I hope to be back on tour with The Faceless again in the near future. We will fill you all in on details regarding future tours as soon as they develop. Please go support The Faceless on the rest of this fantastic tour and I will catch up with you all down the road." - Evan Brewer

VIt's been four years since Polarity (2010) was released, and it was released it within two years of Diminishing Between Worlds (2008).  It's been 7 years since Odious Mortem released Cryptic Implosion (2007).  It just had me wondering, and I'm really hoping these two bands don't wait ten years between releases and basically ignore fans like Necrophaggits.  I know there are plenty of quality tech death bands available, but Necrophagist, Odious Mortem, and Decrepit Birth were the first three bands that really turned me on to the genre and I'm beginning to feel like a concerned parent.  Muhammed pls.
