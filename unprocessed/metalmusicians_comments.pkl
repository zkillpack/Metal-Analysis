asVRecording your own music, what does YOUR setup look like?
p13
(lp14
VYou can get great results with what you've currently got as long as you do it right. Don't be embarassed. People seem to think more/better/more expensive gear = better sound (and in some cases that's true), but you can do a ton of good shit with very little in this day and age. And why not just pop EZDrummer into Reaper instead of doing it in FL?\u000a\u000a**My setup:**\u000a\u000a* Line 6 Toneport UX1 interface (supercheap and old)\u000a* EVH 5153 50w (I mostly use ampsims though, easier)\u000a* Shure SM57 for amp/vocals\u000a* REAPER for recording/mixing (it's great)\u000a* Steven Slate for drums\u000a\u000a[Here's an original song I recorded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTJbkG3I27E)\u000a\u000aGuitars are x50 ampsim, bass are 2 blended DI tracks (1clean/1distorted), vocals Sm57, can't remember drums. Everything mashed together and mixed in Reaper.
p15
aVThis song sounds amazing, I can't believe this was done with reaper. Honestly, I didn't know you could pop EZdrummer into reaper. I should learn more about this program, and amp simulators. \u000a\u000aI've heard a lot of good things about the Shure SM57 recently. I'll look into this, thanks so much. This blew my mind!
p16
aVHaha! Yes, just get an SM57 right now. It's just one of those mics ***EVERYONE*** seems to have at least 1 of. Get a pop-filter while you're at it if you don't already have one.\u000a\u000aYeah you can add EZD in to Reaper as a VSTi plugin.\u000a\u000aFor ampsims I recommend the LePou amps. LePou also makes a good cab-simulator (aka Impulse Loader) called LeCab2. For impulses themselves ("cabs") go download the GuitarHacks Impulse pack.\u000a\u000a^ All of that = free\u000a\u000aYou can also look into the TSE (The Serina Experiment) stuff. They have a great tubescreamer vst and also a really good Bass DI vst based off the Sansamp Bass Driver.\u000a
p17
aVI must be doing something completely wrong, because I have everyone of those same ampsim plugins, Le Pou etc., and it gives me the worst sounding distortion I've ever heard. So I just plug directly into my Presonus interface from my Line 6 Spider IV head for a decent sound. 
p18
aVI just have to ask but you are adding LeCab to the back of that, yes?
p19
aVPretty sure I am, but now you got me second guessing. I'll double check when I get home. 
p20
aVYeah because the pre-amp only sounds like absolute dung.
p21
aVReally cool song. Do you have any other stuff posted anywhere?
p22
aVThanks, dude! I have some stuff here and there but it varies a lot by genre. I have mostly covers on the YT channel in my previous post, I have some original songs [on this YT channel (link)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUuvpJofUWk) but it's more of a modern/metalcore'ish take on it, so it's not for everyone.\u000a\u000aCurrently working on some new death metal/br00tal type stuff that i'll post here when I get vocals on it!
p23
aVMy band uses a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 USB interface for guitars and bass. Currently no vocalist at this time so no reason for a mic.  As far as a DAW, we use ProTools program the drums with Superior Drummer.  I believe we've used the Drumkit from Hell bank for the majority of our songs so far.  All our guitar and bass tones are from Ez mix 2. Absolutely fantastic, they sound killer. And then various mixing and mastering plugins, compression, etc.  It comes out pretty neat sounding! (https://soundcloud.com/theabuseofreason)
p24
aVHey, thanks for that.\u000a\u000aI like your music, everything sounds great. How are you plugging into your Focusrite? Never even heard of EZ mix before. I hope protools has gone down a bit in price since I last checked.\u000a\u000aGreat job, I wish my tracks sounded that clean.
p25
aVThanks for the listen! We plug in straight from the guitar to the interface with the guitar cables.  All the tones are generated from the plugins. Toontrack makes EZ mix as well as superior drummer. I'd suggest checking them out! Great company and they work with a lot of artists to make the plugins authentic. 
p26
aVWouldn't have known where to start without hearing about all of this, thanks so much. I'll follow you on soundcloud.
p27
aVThanks! I really appreciate that! Hopefully this well help you get on your feet. 
p28
aV"You Wanted This" sounds amazing. Could I lay some vocals on this?
p29
aVHell yeah dude! Go for it, I'd love to hear vocals on that one. 
p30
aVI have the most ghetto set-up ever. For my guitar amp I'm using a Fender Mustang II, and that's being recorded by a cheap Logitech USB mic. I'm using garageband as my software, as a result the majority of my time recording is spent fucking with different effects on the drums to make them not sound so weird. My guitars are a Squire Stratocaster and an Ibanez that I haven't been able to identify. I also have a fender p-bass and ibanez bass amp, but I usually don't record bass just because my mic can't handle the lows. Vocals (harsh and clean) are also recorded on the Logitech.
p31
aVI record my POD HD500x into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 into my Macbook Air running Reaper. I use EZDrummer with the Metal Machine expansion and track the drums directly in Reaper. I have a pair of Maudio monitors (forget the model offhand) and one of those Bose nose canceling headphones for when I need to be quiet.  It feels like a decent  setup. I just put it together literally this week so I am still learning all the ropes.

aVMine is pretty simple: Pro Tools and an Eleven Rack. The 11r makes a fine interface. I use various other tools in PT including Steven Slate Drums for, well, the drums, and other Slate plugins. \u000a\u000aEDIT: [A little of my work](https://soundcloud.com/pwwilly/hmm-aka-the-djent-space-ballad)

aVGuitar -&gt; Rocksmith USB cable -&gt; PC with Cubase 5 -&gt; Guitar Rig 5. I have an old Marshall amp and cab and some pedals but it's far easier for me to go with the entirely digital route. 
p35
aVMy set up is as so, Esp h-200 &gt; fender mustang floor &gt; ableton live/fl studio (depends if im on my laptop or not). The mustang floor comes with the fender fuse software which I use to determine my guitar sound. I program my drums in beatcraft with a random collection of samples I've found. Currently no vocal recording set up. You can hear a rough demo of an old song I recently recorded with this set up at WWW.soundcloud.com/baremyteeth
p36
aVMy band recorded our demo with a drum machine because we lost our drummer, garageband amp plugins for the guitar and bass amps, and the computer mike for the vocals. A vocal mike with a plosive screen is high on our priorities.
p37
aVSound engineers didn't have these screens in the past. The best thing to do is put the mic 45 degrees off-axis with the vocalist and make sure the vocalist steps back as far as it takes to not record breathing. You can see Peter Steele and even Freddie Mercury doing that crap on nearly all live performances especially because it looks like Peter liked using SM57's (or similar) as main mic a lot of the time. It still works and it's free.
p38
aVDo you have a visual demonstration of how the mike should be angled? "45 degrees off-axis" is kind of Greek to me.

aVSounds goods dude.  Sacrament is my goto album to practice my vocals to. I find myself singing this song alot. Maybe try and find an instrumental version of the song so you don't hear Randy's vox.
p51
aVcheers for the feedback peeps. I updated the backing track to an instrumental so no more Randy, what do you think?
p52
asVLooking for some feedback on this instrumental mix
p53
(lp54
VThe mix is good, I think you really nailed the djent sound with the both the guitar tone and what I assume are programmed drums. The one thing I would look into would be randomizing the velocity more on the drum hits, it can make the drums feel more natural especially on the snare fills.
p55
aVIt's always people with the best productions/mixes that ask for help because they think it sucks.\u000a\u000aHonestly it sounds great, played very well, and the tone is spot on. Btw this song is killer too. It's got a weird ambient/suspended tension which you don't hear a lot in this style of music, I think that's really cool!\u000a\u000aAlso what The Great Dissonance said about drums. Ramdomizing velocity (and even timing a bit) can help a lot. Also throwing mild reverb on top them can help. I know in this style likes very dry and up front sounds, but if you're using a drum machine you really should consider dirtying it up at least a little.

aVHey, gotta make my mark some how, right? 
p60
aVI ain't even mad, that's an amazing name. 
p61
aVMight wanna put a noise gate on your guitars. Nothing too harsh, just enough to stop the static coming through.
p62
aVYeah, I need to go and trim out the static during the pauses!  The guitars are already gated as hell, it's just that the room I'm in has crappy wiring, and my 808x pickups love to hum like crazy.
p63
aVGate it hard, and also, when working on 8-strings, power-chords on the low register doesn't really work, so you'll gain some clarity by switching to single note on the stop riffs. It's plenty fat to support it.\u000a\u000aBut can't wait for you to post the full. :D
p64
aVThe production sounds surprisingly good with my shitty headphones (i'm at work)
p65
aVHopefully it sounds good on a decent set of speakers as well, haha.
p66
aVOn my monitoring headphones now, it sounds even better, great job ! Indeed, gating the guitar is the only thing I have to add. \u000a\u000aWould you care to elaborate on your settings ? How did you record the guitars, what are the drums ? I'd love to be able to have that kind of song, even if it's a bit too "modern" and "polished" for my taste, it's very professional.
p67
aVSure thing!  I use Sony Acid for my DAW, since it's super easy to use, and has great inline midi editing.  For the drums, I use Superior Drummer with Metal Foundry.  I use Frederik from Meshuggah's "Bleed" preset kit as a starting point, and tweaked it a bit here and there.  I programmed the drum midi tracks by hand, and discovered that this song would be a pain in the ass to play live, lol.\u000a\u000aThe guitars were all recorded using a Line 6 POD HD with custom tones I made, using the Treadplate amp.  I could go more in depth as to my actual chain if you'd like, since it's tad complicated.\u000a\u000aAs for the tracking, there are 2 hard panned guitar tracks where I'm playing the lower register of my 8-string (Ibanez RGA8 with an 808x in the bridge position), then 2 guitar tracks playing an octave higher, each panned 50% to either the left or right.\u000a\u000aFor mastering, I have the final mix running through the fab filter limiter VST, with a 3.0 dB boost, and the "metal - natural loudness" preset.\u000a\u000aI'm happy to share any other info you'd like, cause at one point in time, I was an absolutely terrible producer, but figured out how to make decent recordings using a pretty minimal setup!  (Gaming PC, POD HD, two KRK Rokit 5 studio monitors, some software, and a couple guitars) \u000a\u000a
p68
aVAlso wanted to point out that this recording was done from start to finish in 5 hours.  In that 5 hours, I learned how to play it, transposed it to my 8-string (super easy), programmed the drums by hand, and tracked all the guitar parts.  5 hours for 90 seconds of audio, hahaha.

asVCab simulator problems in Reaper
p70
(lp71
VThe way i used to get around this before i upgraded my pc was to render each track as a WAV file. If you right click a track there should be an option to render as .WAV? or something similar. This will just create a wav file of the track with all the current plugins on it. That way you can disable all the plugins on the original track and just keep this new WAV file which doesn't require much CPU power at all, as its just playing an audio file. It's a bit of a pain in the ass as if you wanna make any tweaks to your tone as you gotta go back and re render it all again each time but it's somewhat of a fix. Hope this helps!
p72
aVYup, it's a pain in the ass but this is the only way to do it without upgrading your computer.
p73
aVThanks! I appreciate the advice. If I can't find any way around using a lot of CPU, this will guarantee that I can move forward with my project. 
p74
aVIs your computer really, really old? An instance of your average impulse loader on my 2011 Macbook Pro only uses up 2-3% of CPU at most (Recabinet uses something like .5%), and they're generally designed to be low-CPU usage for precisely this reason. Make sure all the plugins have the lowest possible quality and oversampling on- if I run everything on high quality and 4-8X oversampling my computer will also start to heat up and glitch. Also quitting out of the interface for the plugins definitely helps. If you still can't run it smoothly, try replacing LeCab with NadIR from Ignite Amps and modify your latency settings in Reaper. You can go as high as 8-10% without it being too noticeable. If you STILL can't run the software in real time and don't have the money for a new computer, /u/Paulsh90 is correct that you can always render each item. \u000a\u000aBTW, just tangentially, there's no such thing as "holding off" on the cabinet simulator- it's half the guitar tone :P That's like buying a guitar but holding off on strings. You need it! Not sure if that guide recommends stacking impulses on top of one another in LeCab, but you can honestly ignore that- I usually use just one impulse of a Mesa cab with an SM57 mic and it's totally sufficient. That can also save you CPU.
p75
aVThanks for the help!\u000a\u000a&gt; there's no such thing as "holding off" on the cabinet simulator- it's half the guitar tone :P That's like buying a guitar but holding off on strings. You need it!\u000a\u000aI know that now, haha. Can you tell I'm new at this?\u000a\u000a&gt; Not sure if that guide recommends stacking impulses on top of one another in LeCab\u000a\u000aIt did, yes. \u000a\u000a&gt; Make sure all the plugins have the lowest possible quality and oversampling on\u000a\u000a&gt; modify your latency settings in Reaper\u000a\u000aHow do I do these things?\u000a\u000aAlso, why do you recommend NadIR if Recabinet apparently uses so little CPU? 
p76
aVBecause Recabinet costs $50 or so, and the new version (which has built-in Framus Cobra/5150/5150 ii/ENGL Savage amp sims) is going to be even more expensive, whereas NadIR is free. \u000a\u000aFor the plugins, usually they'll say "oversampling" or "high quality" somewhere on them. You can also go to the far upper-right hand corner of the plugin window in Reaper and click "UI" and it will show you a non-fancy version of all the plugin's controls, if for some reason you have trouble finding it. \u000a\u000aAs for Reaper's latency...it depends on a bunch of things, including whether you're using an external audio interface, what kind of interface, whether it has its own latency controls, etc. Just google "reaper latency settings" or something and you'll find guides on how to do it that will explain better than I can. 
p77
aVI switched to NadIR, and the problem is basically gone! Thank you! You're awesome!
p78
aVGlad it worked! :)
p79
aVLeCab glitched out on me all the time. I couldn't load a project with LeCab if I had moved the impulses or else it would crash everything. Shame because the UI and options you get with it are pretty awesome.\u000a\u000aI use keFIR now, it's very simple and does the job pretty ok. Make sure to set the mix knob to 100%. Try that and see if it helps.

asVVocal stomp boxes - trying to thicken up my sound
p81
(lp82
VGuitar pedals would compress the signal a bit oddly for vocals, and you'd end up with a vaguely telephone-ish quality to your voice. \u000a\u000aThe ideal solution would be to work on your technique, whether it be more diaphragm support or microphone control.
p83
asVStill learning to mix/master. Here is a current work in progress and I'd love to get some feedback. Thanks in advance.
p84
(lp85
VMastering sounds fine to me, however I think the drums could use some more TLC, mostly EQ, to sit better in the mix. Likewise I think the bass could come out more to fatten up the riffs and still not be overpowering. Nice work
p86
aVyeah, the snare drum sticks out too much, I suggests EQing that. And you need to up the bass drum.
p87
aVI appreciate the feedback :)\u000a\u000aThe drums and bass deff need more work, but being a guitar player first that's kinda what I'm trying to focus on right now.
p88
aVHonest/blunt/brief critique to follow. Not being an asshole, genuinely want to help your ears hear what my ears hear. I'm not an "authority" on mixing by any means, but I know a good one when I hear it (as well as a bad one).\u000a\u000aGuitars: Way too tinny. They have absolutely no body. The thin-ness of the tone/EQ also has the additional adverse effect of "centering" your stereo-panned guitars, reducing their width and power. Fight the temptation to give them more "bite" to "stand out" more. Trust me, a well-rounded tone will stand out on its own. Also, 1:53 - 2:05 is a pretty big performance issue. Out-of-time sweeps were highly noticeable and distracting. Re-record or re-write to the guitarist's actual ability.\u000a\u000aDrums: Clearly MIDI. Aside from that, the kicks have a rough time standing out. They *might* need more click, BUT the main issue likely stems from the problem of your guitar tone: the guitars are invading the top-end space where the "click" of your drum hits and even some of your cymbals are supposed to sit. They are also very "dry". Like, they lack any sense of space. A light reverb send could assist here. \u000a\u000aBass: Where is it?
p89
aVI appreciate the feedback.\u000a\u000aGuitars- I get the feeling I know what you're talking about. I'll run down what I'm doing. I've got 2 tracks panned left and right. Each with a TSE808, LeCab Legion, LeBad 2 with catharsis impulses, and then a highpass-lowpass filter. Then on the master track I've got multiband dynamics, a compressor, and a limiter. I'm not sure what else I need to do in order to flesh out the tone. Here's a picture of my [settings](http://i.imgur.com/9gayCGe.png)\u000a\u000aThe bass and drums I'm less worried about atm, though I'm aware they need more work. I really want to nail down the guitars before I focus on the rest.
p90
aVI suppose I can't speak for the quality of the LeCab plugin or related impulses since I've never tried them. I'm a bit worried that you scooped the mids in your EQ, however. That's pretty much where you want guitars to dominate. I typically try and scoop out a bit of the harsher, tinny high-mids with a slight peak on either end of the scoop to get a bit of the edge back. It creates the illusion of having that high-end bite still there, but without all the harsher frequencies muddying the top end.\u000a\u000aOn top of this, you might be slamming your multi-band compressor and/or limiter too hard, which can further exaggerate frequencies you boosted or left behind. Less is more imo.\u000a\u000aHere's some images of my rhythm guitar EQ's as well as my bass guitar EQ: http://imgur.com/a/QMn00\u000a\u000aAnd here's a little snippet of what it sounds like with everything in the mix: https://soundcloud.com/sean-golyer/test\u000a\u000aAll of it is subjective of course, there's no "right" way to do it. It all comes down to what YOU want hear and what is pleasing to your ears. Try and compare your mix at the same volume level side-by-side another professional mix that you admire in a similar genre/style and try and pick out the differences and figure out what ways you can make yours sound better/more professional.

VI like the first version better. The tone is way gnarlier and it's mixed better. The layering in the final version is overkill man, I can't even listen to the riffs.

aVAround the time we released our full length (fall 2012), we got some good press from places like [Metal Hammer Bulgaria](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/69210342/616372_214571682011206_1024035707_o.jpg), [MetalSucks](http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/10/01/unsigned-and-unholy-sectu-existem-and-signo-rojo/), and [Heavy Blog is Heavy](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2013/02/20/existem-years-of-winter/). Almost a year later, Metal Injection put us in [this thing here,](http://www.metalinjection.net/bandcamp-buried-treasure/existem-bring-forth-winter-flavored-metal) which I guess put us on the map with them. We had an EP come out after that which was picked up by [MetalSucks](http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/02/21/existem-just-getting-started-phoenix/) again. If I remember correctly, all of these were picked up by the sites without us contacting them first. We got to know a few of the guys from a few of the places, and we spoked with Metal Injection and agreed to premier this new song on their website after trying to preview it a little bit with a [gopro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWYsuwb4Y-s), which we just passed around ourselves on our Facebook page

aVHey I appreciate the response! Awesome stuff. 
p116
asVWhat is the best software for creating thrash metal music and backing tracks and such?
p117
(lp118
VGrab a DAW of some kind, I like Reaper personally. You'll also need a drum plugin, try superior drummer, ez drummer or addictive drums. From there you can get killer tones with amp sim, try TSE audio for preamp and Poulin lecab for an impulse loader. From there its just setting it up and tracking stuff. Have fun dude! 
p119
aVYou might poke around /r/wearethemusicmakers. They have a lot more production content. There really isn't a best DAW for thrash metal. If you're on a mac get Logic, I'd you're on a PC you have more options. I use Pro Tools but I don't know if it's the "best" one; it's just the one I use. If you're broke get Reaper. You'll also need a DI box.
p120
asVI've been noticing this with all the playthroughs i've been watching lately
p121
(lp122
VAre you talking about anchoring or am I misunderstanding? It's a comfort thing and is how a lot of people learned to play the guitar. A lot of people say it's bad, but John Petrucci does it, so those people can fuck themselves.
p123
aVAnd Mikael, and Michael Romeo, and a lot of spectacular guitarists. 
p124
aVI'm assuming anchoring, yes. I wasn't aware there was a term for it. But alright then, I just noticed that i don't anchor like some others because it feels unnatural. Thanks for clearing that up.
p125
aVIt really just depends on what feels natural for you. I really can't see how one would be better than the other. Personally I think it looks more aesthetically pleasing if guitarists don't anchor and kind of fan out their other fingers, but I just can't play like that lol
p126
aVI'm a bassist so I thought you meant below the low E string. I got a funny mental image trying to imagine someone playing like that.
p127
aVIt's called anchoring and classical guitarists like me hate it.
p128
aVI guess what I meant to put also was does anyone else play like this? Is the pinky resting there during quick alternate picking/"djenting" advantageous at all or is it just a comfortability thing?
p129
aV[deleted]

aVI think MA Batio said it helps for shredding in a trailer for one of his dvds.

asVCheapish PA system?
p139
(lp140
Vhttp://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/phonic-powerpod-410-s710-pa-package\u000a\u000aAbout as cheap as it gets
p141
aVIf you just need one or two vocal mics, many cheap keyboard amps have XLR inputs and can be used as makeshift PAs.  My band uses this for a practice set-up, &amp; it's loud enough to be heard over a pretty substantial doom rig.  
p142
aVHow does it sound? 
p143
aVI have a [Behringer Keyboard amp](http://www.behringer.com/assets/KX1200_P0114_Left_XL.jpg) and it's fine.  You will be loud enough to be audible over serious amounts of amplification, and the signal will be clean.  Keep in mind that this is the only thing we use to amp our vocals during practices-  it's not as though we're pairing this with monitor wedges for each person in the band, so if you play in a huge band where you would want multiple audio sources during practice, this is probably not the best option.
p144
asVI've been writing/recording/rewriting this song since I started playing guitar, almost 4 years now. Any critiques so far?
p145
(lp146
VNot sure why it took you four years, but this is a great metal song.\u000a\u000aIt's crying out for bass and vocals.\u000a\u000aThe recording is decent, even pretty good. Hard to really critique without hearing bass and vocals.\u000a\u000aOverall, I really like the composition. It could use a bit more in the way of dynamics, it's kind of always on 11 but that's cool too. It's a fast fist-pumper. Good job. Love to hear with bass and vox.
p147
aVIt took so long just because I was never satisfied with how it sounded until now. But, thanks for listening! \u000a\u000aI plan on adding bass and vocals ASAP. I really think it'll shine then. 
p148
aVFor only playing four years, you're pretty good. I like this song a lot. I would quad track the guitars or something.

(lp162
Vplay with a metronome. 
p163
aVThat would absolutely be a good idea lol. I have one on my DAW but i can't hear the metronome over my playing. That and I only have ipod headphones and they dont reach far enough to my speakers. My computer setup is kinda awkward for recording. This whole recording thing is pretty confusing to me, I've never done it before. I just wanted some feedback on the song itself, not so much the quality and timing of it. So I didn't really focus too much on making it perfect.

aVEQ that shit brah\u000a\u000aYour recordings are large ass marble blocks. You need to start chipping away to make that masterpiece of art. Search on youtube for "how to EQ metal guitars and bass."\u000a
p180
aVThis will be my recording and the EQ my chisel:  http://imgur.com/viVgtq4
p181
aVI'm really going to say the same thing everyone else here will tell you. EQ everything properly, record both the Left and Right guitars twice, pan them differently (70%-100%), and then after parallel compression, reverb, added noisiness and distortion or whatever, limiting and going through the whole mastering process, you will sound a lot "bigger"...
p182
aVThank you!  I'm going to try this too.  
p183
aVHoe many layers are you doing?
p184
aVSince the EQing was already mentioned here is a great video for a bass-tone that will fit great in the mix. The bass is imho the most critical instrument for putting a metal-sound together\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3iwNLIgtK0
p185
aVInformative and insulting!!  Thank you!
p186
aVI'm going to repeat what others have already stated.  Record 2 rhythm guitars, and hard pan them left and right.  Leads down the middle, or have them panning left and right as the track goes along to give a spacey stereo effect.\u000a\u000aI do all my stuff in my home studio using a Line 6 POD HD as my direct line input and all my effects.  You can check out my demos and what not here :\u000a\u000ahttp://www.soundcloud.com/what-is-sleep/\u000a\u000aI also use FabFilter's Pro-L limiter VST on the "Master Track" when I'm mixing down to boost the overall mix, and normalize the volume a bit.\u000a\u000aWhat DAW are you using?  I use Sony Acid Pro, and though it is quite dated, it's intuitive, works for what I do, has inline midi editing, and just feels like home.\u000a\u000aIf you have ANY questions at all, I'd be more than happy to help out!
p187
aVNormally, I use Audacity and Steinberg Wavelab LE 7.  I used audacity to record with multiple tracks and then I use wavelab to master/edit.  It's a pain transferring files though, I'm going to get Reaper.\u000a\u000aThe trial of the Pro-L limiter VST is pretty awesome!!  Really easy to use.  \u000a\u000aThanks a lot for your help too.  I think I just have to take everyone's info and practice until I get it right.  Awesome Demo's too, I really like Imminence and Isolation.  
p188
aVThanks!  Music is the best outlet for me, when it comes to day to day stress and anxiety, so helping others get better at it as a whole is what I try to do whenever possible.\u000a\u000aYour post kind of inspired me to try new things tonight, and I finally got around to downloading the "demo" (which is fully functional for 60 days) of Reaper, and I'm 99.9% sure it's going to be my new DAW.  It does everything that I need Sony Acid to do, plus some, and it does it better, without crashing.  When my 60 days are up, I'm most definitely going to drop $60 so I can get an official license.  It's that good.
p189
aVAWesome!!  Glad I could be of inspiration.  I'll probably definentally get reaper now.  I know it has a lot of stuff/features that advanced softwares have, but it's all straightforeward and easy to use.  
p190
asVMetal musicians, does your dream of writing and performing metal music ever get doubted? Who doubts you and how do you get through it?
p191
(lp192
VFirst of all...becoming a touring metal musician is not a pipe dream. Thinking you can make any sort of living off of it *is*, however. Very few people can actually make a living off of it. If you do, you're very lucky.\u000a\u000aThat doesn't mean you shouldn't strive towards that goal. You just shouldn't bank on it by any means. Keep up a good work ethic in your life, and it will amp up your work ethic in music, too. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I'd say I'm my biggest doubter. I find myself completely dis-enthused and even jaded at times. The main way I can get through this is by trying to play with as many different musicians as possible. I'm lucky to have a large amount of friends and acquaintances who are phenomenal musicians. Playing with better musicians makes you better, and makes you want it more and more, and inspires you. \u000a\u000aI only get to tour about two weeks out of every year, if that much. I'd like to do more, but one must be reasonable and realistic. I'm only 25, so I am still young. If you get to this age and think you're slacking because you're not touring 2 or 3 months out of the year yet, don't give up. Seen plenty of my friends who ate shit for years before finally hitting it "big" and touring a bunch in their late 20s, early 30s. As long as you keep with it, and keep focused, it's a reasonable reality
p193
aVThanks for your advice! I'm actually used to being the better musician in the room but you're right...I have to change that soon
p194
aVIt's a big help. Playing with a superb drummer I would say is what you should strive towards the most. There's not much more satisfying things in playing music than when the drummer gets it immediately. I've played with a dude a couple times who has understood my riffs better than I ever did. But he is an exception to the rule haha
p195
aVYes my fiance is the superb drummer in this situation, and fuck it helps a lot. The drums on the demos are a machine but he wrote all of them.\u000a\u000aHere's my youtube channel, we covered Protest The Hero together:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs333ga5K2dAvRjyhaQ-5wg
p196
aV\u000aI am my biggest threat to my success.  ADHD, anxiety, self-doubt, poor confidence, being bad at multi-tasking, getting bored, etc...It's all me.  If anyone (except my wife) told me I was crazy, I wouldn't give two shits.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI play in a hardcore/crossover band and we get out, on average, twice to four times every 6 weeks.  We've played a couple festivals and with some serious bands and have gotten around.  We all have full-time jobs, I have a family, and our responsibilities keeps us physically grounded.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is the most active and the most profitable I have ever been in a band and it's not what I envisioned when I was 15.  However, I play with guys I know and respect, a couple I've known for over ten years.  If not for our representation, we wouldn't be getting paid anything - we're lucky that our expenses are getting paid back.  So, while I am not road-dogging it for 22 weeks out of the year, or playing at Hellfest, I'm really grateful for the opportunities I have.  
p197
aVWhere is your band from? 
p198
aVTexas (yee haw)
p199
aVI feel like Texas is a tough crowd for hardcore/metal....But I think we play completely different kinds of music haha. How is the fanbase for you out there? 
p200
aVGood.  The band has been around for while, so there's a good base of dedicated fans and friends.  This year, South and Central Texas had great energy.
p201
aVThere's nothing wrong with working towards that goal, just make sure you've got a career to fall back on if it doesn't work out. Get a good job and keep practicing/playing in your spare time, if you do get lucky enough to make it a full-time job then there'll come a time when you'll be able to quit your day job and be a professional musician.
p202
aVI get doubt from inside my own band... I'll send them a piece and all I get is, "that's cool but I can't play that" in return. What I try to convey to them is that a new piece should always be daunting, but it's never impossible unless you give up before you even try. \u000a\u000aBut I doubt if we'll ever tour or make money... we're in this because we love it, I guess. Everything else is just gravy for us. 
p203
aVThat is too bad...maybe you should suggest longer hours of alone time practice to the members of your band so you can play the harder stuff. Can I have a listen to your music?
p204
aVI'm definitely already trying to drill that into them.\u000a\u000aAll I have are crappy GP renders at the moment. Most of our old stuff is between hard rock and alternative metal. We previously recorded an album, but the producer didn't understand what kind of band he was mixing; it turned out badly and I refuse to show it to anyone. Frankly, I don't know what kind of band we are, we just play what we like. \u000a\u000aThis is the latest song I've been pushing. It's still missing some parts (like an intro, for starters). I also don't really know how to write drums.\u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/visceracodex/untitled-metal
p205
aVThat song would be so sick with real stuff! Keep going man, and maybe excel above your band mates to get them moving. 
p206
aVI've been playing guitar for 20 years, and there's still a lot of stuff I can't play that some kids have mastered in a few months.\u000a\u000aNot everybody has the kind of mentality for drilling practices or learning to shred. You probably don't want to change the music you write (and why should you?) so you might have to dish out some polite ultimatums to your band and be prepared to replace them.
p207
aVI have given up on touring in a band right now, fuck I have only played 2 shows in a metal band. So I never even came close to having fans. I have resorted to being a bedroom artist and if that's all I ever become as long as I can release some metal for the world I will be happy.\u000a\u000aI never wanted to be a rockstar, just some dude in a band. I can't even be that right now so maybe when I'm older.\u000a\u000aDon't give up, just fail a lot and maybe you'll make it.
p208
aVI get doubt from all sides, even the other metal musicians I know. But its what I like to do and god dammit Im gonna do it. Right now all I do is record, I put the dream of touring and all that behind me since Im 22 now and dont have much to show for anything.\u000a\u000aMy parents always supported me in their own way. They hate my music but they can appreciate that Im "good" at what I do.\u000a\u000aIt all comes down to if you have the means to be a touring musician, do it. If you dont have the means (such as my self) compromise and have a backup plan for if it doesnt work out.\u000a\u000aYour band has an awesome sound though, keep it up and youll be living your dream in no time!
p209
aVThanks for your kind words! That's all I want to do is tour and be on the road. My fiancé actually is the drummer in our band, it helps the dream for sure. (I'm a female) 
p210
aVCurrently starting up my own project. All of my band mates are just as pumped about getting out and playing music, so it really helps to bounce hype off each other. Find some people that are just as passionate as yourself. You'll never doubt yourself again. 
p211
aVI know the feel...I need more people who are stoked. Where is your project from? 
p212
aVWe're out of davenport IA. Look is up if you get a chance! \u000a\u000ahttps://thecircadianrhythm.bandcamp.com
p213
aVI've released a couple of metal albums and got decent press for them, so that part is 'done'. But touring? That'll probably never happen. It's so hard to get shows these days (at least here in the UK) because nobody wants to see unsigned bands they've never heard of, so being able to get more than one show a month is unusual; getting enough to 'tour' is impossible. I think that unless you're playing one of the trendy subgenres, you'll be on album 3 or 4 before there is enough interest for international tours and the like.
p214
aVDoes your band still strive to become signed one day? 
p215
aVNot really. It's not like 10 or 20 years ago where the label would not only pay for your recording but also pay for you to go on tour to promote it. So you don't get much benefit. Maybe they can introduce you to booking agents and publicists, but it's still not guaranteed they'll take you on, and you can get those without a label if you're lucky. I know quite a few signed musicians and they still work full-time day jobs so it's not like it changes their life or means they've "made it". It just means someone has agreed to cover the cost of making an album every couple of years, in exchange for taking most of the money from it.
p216
aVHm, my band is my hobby. It's (one of many) very expensive and time-sinky hobbies and is clear to everyone involved and who knows me, that it ist just that a hobby.\u000aI do not want to earn money with music, I am quite happy when a label helps out or we get some cash out of gigs to do merch etc. but I like my primary caree choice way to much, to even think of abandoning it for anything else.
p217
asVOkay, I need help.
p218
(lp219
VFind someone that is willing to teach you for free. The internet is full of those people. Use YouTube. Obviously some videos will be better than others, but some teachers are better than others too. I'll even [give you a link] (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=beginner+guitar+lesson).
p220
aVYeah I have a friend who is willing but we can never find the time for it.\u000aYeah YouTube has really helped in the past.\u000aThanks for the link man :p
p221
aVMake sure to be consistent. There will be times where you feel like it's impossible, but those are the times you need to persevere and keep practicing. Getting good at guitar is not an overnight process.
p222
aVSimply put, if you don't find time for it, it's not important to you. Maybe it's not important to your friend to teach you for free. That shouldn't stop you, because there's still a wealth of information freely available online.\u000a\u000aYou just need to practice. Sit down and play, no excuses, no hesitation. Just play.
p223
aVI already do. I play 2-3 hours a day, pretty much every day of the week. I just don't feel like I'm getting any better any more.
p224
aVFind tabs, learn songs using said tabs, that's a large part of how I learned.  /r/Guitar is a decent sub as well.\u000a\u000aWhen you say you can't read "Scales" would I be correct in guessing that you mean tabs?
p225
aVThat's pretty much all I'm currently doing anyway.\u000aAnd no I can read tabs just fine. I mean like 'C Scale' or the 'Pentatonic Scale'. I haven't a clue what either are.
p226
aVif you're looking for someone to basically teach you how to play metal, i can promise you that somebody out there in metal-land will teach you for beer.
p227
aVI would suggest using Songsterr for tabs as it shows the rhythms and is usually pretty accurate. Also, down pick. I honestly can't stress enough how much learning how to pick correctly and fast improved my playing.  
p228
aV[deleted]
p229
aVOne thing I did that helped me tremendously was a stylus pick.  I think someone from this sub actually suggested it.  You can order a 3 pack online for around 5 bucks [Here](http://store.styluspick.com/Stylus-Pick-3-Pack_p_9.html). Find a cool lick and practice playing it to a metronome with the stylus pick.  You will be able to alternate pick like a pro in no time.  Download a metronome app or find one online.  [MetronomeOnline.com](http://www.Metronomeonline.com)
p230
aVthere's a program called riffstation that seems to be pretty cool, although i don't own it. maybe it would be worth pirating an old version to see if you like it before you buy it. in addition, we live in the age of the internet. there are literally thousands of guitar tutorials across hundreds of sites available at your fingertips. give those a shot. anywhere is a good start.
p231
aVSounds like you don't internet so well either. If you don't know what a term is, you can look it up in Google or DuckDuckGo.\u000a\u000a* [free online guitar lessions](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=free+online+guitar+lessons)\u000a* [pentatonic scale](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pentatonic+scale)\u000a* [how to read music](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+read+music)\u000a
p232
asVWould like some constructive criticism on my bands first release "A.I." please?
p233
(lp234
VI like it. I'm getting a bit of a Darkest Hour vibe from it. If you really want constructive criticism, the rhythm guitar is really repetitive mainly that the chorus sounds like it needs a little more variation. The vocals are good, clean and harsh, but need more clarity, especially on the cleans. The overall production is good though. Very nice job. What do you play? 
p235
aVCool! Thanks heaps, Glad you like it!\u000aYeah I play the drums! Unfortunately they are a bit boring, but this was recorded awhile ago and since then, I wish I could of re written the drums, but hey! That's whats great about every release
p236
aVPersonally, I really enjoyed it man. I think you really utilised the different feels throughout the song (e.g the mood changes when you swap between vocal types). In reference to the repetition of the rhythm guitars, sometimes less is more and i had no problem with it. Subscribed, ill be listening out for more of your stuff! Its good to see another aussie band release some kick ass music.\u000a
p237
aVThankyou so much! This honestly means a lot to us, as this EP will be 2 years in the making haha, so we're super keen to get our music out to the world!\u000aBe on the lookout for new tunes and show your friends :) 
p238
aV2 years in the making!? Jeez, how big is it? My band just released our EP and writing/producing it only took about 9 months, but mind you, we're only a metalcore band so 7 tracks wasnt so hard to do. \u000a\u000aWhere abouts in australia are you guys located?
p239
aVHaha, oh well I mean we had a lot of member problems, the music as such didn't take 2 years to write or anything! \u000aI love metalcore, whats your band?\u000aWe are from Taree, NSW :) 
p240
aVAh right. My band is called [Guardian](https://guardianband.bandcamp.com/releases), from Sydney.
p241
aVSick, I'll check you guys out :)
p242
aVThanks :) When i heard your song, the first thing i did was link it to the rest of my band and they all love it! Hopefully our bands will cross paths one day haha\u000a
p243
aVDefinitely man! We should play a show one day in Sydney! 
p244
aVActually really kick ass dude, fucking solid track. I would have to say my only gripe is vocals seem 'underneath' everything else. Could stand turning them up a bit. Clean vox suffer from this a little more than screams.
p245
aVThanks heaps!! Yeah, the guys who mixed our EP were sort of into a different genre, and we had no idea what we were doing ( Being we are only 17 and 18 years of age) \u000aWe still have a lot to learn ;) 
p246
aVThe song is really good, but you guys need to automate things when mixing.  I can hear the limiter kicking in pushing still down.  You need to lower your instruments and let the vocals come through.  If you fix this the song will be pretty much perfect.
p247
aVThank you so much for your words! Yes, unfortunately we didn't record, mix or master the tracks and to be honest, we weren't exactly happy with what the final result was, but hey. Nothings perfect :( \u000a
p248
aVNice trick in the beginning. I did not push the volume up, and still got the surprise. Where y'all from? I love the singing, there are so many bands who rely only on gutural vocals and at this moment in time, for me, it's sing or bust.\u000a\u000aHave you heard Black crown initiate? You  could learn a bunch from Jesse. don't say your drums are boring. \u000a\u000aTrick question, are the drums replaced, or processed so that they sound like that? Meaning are they the original acoustic sound? 
p249
aVThanks man! The intro was a last minute decision! :) \u000aWe're from Taree, NSW. Pretty rural bogan town, and we are the only people who have been playing music like this in a long time in our area. \u000aI'll look them up, I have heard of them \u000aYeah they are real drums, but they are a bit processed ( I personally don't really like drum sound we came up with, but oh well)

asVOne man bands! How do you deal with the urge to make other genres?
p264
(lp265
Vi say just make the songs and let the critics worry about finding a genre for you to fill in.
p266
aVConsider it a good thing that you're bored of metal at the moment and listening to other stuff. Sticking with one genre and one genre only for listening and playing tends to be sorta like genetic inbreeding--lack of new ideas causes problems. Steal everything from everywhere but the genre that you're trying to create and you'll sound like a bloody genius.
p267
aVJust make what you feel like making at the moment. It's all you. It will find it's place in a collection if you want it to be in one. I have hundreds of songs around.  Just getting together my first "album" because I've found enough songs that sound like they belong together.
p268
aVI am not a metal musician but my best friend is.\u000a\u000aHis main band is [Black Pestilence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmQ3ANuRz1Y) and they play (in his words) grimy punk rock with electronic noise, all through the devastation of black metal..\u000a\u000aHe also has another band called [The Myconid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECafe79Hrp8) .. not sure how I'd describe it ... just listen.\u000a\u000aLately he's really been getting into composing EDM.\u000a\u000aHe doesn't limit himself musically but he does have different "personas" for his different projects.
p269
aVI think this is it right here: \u000a&gt; ...he does have different "personas" for his different projects.\u000a\u000aJust write what's in your heart. Then retrospectively decide how and where it belongs and in what "persona". Unless you're bound by contract there's no reason to constrain yourself or stifle your creativity under false dichotomies of what you *should* be making.
p270
aVThe big pro of being a one man band is that you can do whatever you feel like. don't stress it. Just write some good shit.
p271
aVI'm am going to make a space themed ska black metal song...Don't ask how or why but I will because I can. After that I want to make a straight black metal song, followed by some thrash...just anything I want.\u000a\u000a
p272
aVI just make different projects. I've got my story-themed concept album metal project, my funeral/Gothic/sad doom project, and my stonery metal project. Outside of metal, I play around with writing voice+guitar blues-folk-rock songs, and then I do a bunch of silly songs.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, make a different persona or just have one persona for everything. 
p273
aVTo answer your question, my musical outlet is immensely fulfilling because there's no limitations to the elements I can incorporate into it.\u000aORCumentary has straight forward and heavy, melodic, upbeat, and melancholy songs. Everything i've written has worked. Currently i've put out two albums and an EP in the 7+ years i've been doing this and i'm working on another album now (shooting for a late 2014-early 2015 release).\u000a\u000a(Check out "ORCumentary Goblin Death March" on youtube. You won't regret it).\u000a\u000aMy next challenge is to either make an acoustic/mellow version of one of my songs or write a song (not an interlude) that's strictly acoustic/mellow. One of the new songs i'm working on also has garage rock elements.

p283
aVExcellent! 
p284
aVReally liked it, and it got nice and heavy towards the middle there. I'm curious about the recording process as it said you guys produced it yourselves. It sounds great. How did you go about recording the drums? I'm wondering because my band is going to start recording our first album soon.

p286
aVJust to put my opinion into some sort of context, I want to say that I'm NOT any sort of big shot in the music industry, but I have been recording bands (especially metal bands) for a while (6+ years)...\u000a\u000aI really dig the music, but to be perfectly honest, the mixing and the mastering sound quite bad... I don't know how it came to happen, maybe the budget was tight, maybe the mixing engineer is still learning, whatever the reason is, I've probably been there, and I understand it, but it doesn't change the fact that right now, your sound is gonna be your first obstacle (imo). Like I said before I dig the music, you guys seem pretty tight (although, I think parts of your song might benefit from a little bit of editing), there's no reason you shouldn't sound way more massive than that. Just my 2 cents.\u000a

aVCan you post this to /r/InnerjerkMusicians ?We could use your kvlt prowess.
p293
asVThis is a song I just released yesterday. I know the production is shitty as all I have to record with are free recording software. But tell me what you think!
p294
(lp295
VWith some vocals and production tweaking, this has a lot of potential.  \u000a\u000aPros: Neat riffing. Pretty solid arrangement\u2014parts varied enough to keep my attention for eight and a half minutes, in fact, you may have inadvertently come close to sonata allegro form. Cool time signature stuff at the beginning.\u000a\u000aCons: The speech clip at the beginning is so long winded that it becomes cheesy. If you MUST insert samples like this, pare them down to their most important parts. A little sloppy playing in the clean tone guitars. If you used a different guitar for these, then [presuming you actually tuned your guitar] it sounds like it either needs intonation, or you need to use heavier gauge strings, or else not fret so hard on the wound strings. \u000a\u000aPM me if you'd like someone to take a crack at programming some hyper realistic drums and/or tightening up your mix (others here would probably be willing as well)
p296
aVThanks for the criticism! Yeah the production is shitty because I'm using free software (audacity and hydrogen drum machine). I used one guitar for everything tuned down to drop B and its been needing an intonation fix for about a month now. My resources are limited lol. 
p297
aVProduction/audio engineering is an entire thing unto itself, and I got really annoyed when I first started writing and recording metal because I realized that, to satisfy myself, I was going to have to learn it as a necessary evil to make any music I recorded actually listenable. But now it's my main hobby in addition to writing music. \u000a\u000aSo with that in mind, tips:\u000a\u000a-Ditch Audacity and download Reaper. It's a free trial that never expires (it's an honor system), but even if you buy it it's only $60. Not as many bells and whistles as Pro Tools or Logic, but plenty of pros use and love it. Watch some production tutorials like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9liitCkItJA), learn how to use a compressor and equalizer and how to master, etc. \u000a\u000a-Buy EZ Drummer 2 when you have the money, preferably with the Metal Machine expansion. Nothing is as good for metal drums as Toontrack products. \u000a\u000a-Buy a cheap Squier Mexican Jazz Bass. \u000a\u000aIt's a bit of cash, but the sum total should run you about $300-$400 at most and you'll have some amazing tools that you can absolutely create a professional-sounding mix with. \u000a\u000a-As far as guitars, not sure what you used here, but you can't go wrong with the Ignite Amps and LePou stuff. Guitar &gt; audio interface &gt; noise gate plugin in Reaper &gt; any tube screamer plugin &gt; amp sim &gt; NadIR impulse loader &gt; Catharsis or Guitar Hack impulses will get you a great tone and everything I just listed (except for the interface of course) is 100% free. \u000a\u000aHope that helps :) And get your intonation fixed! 
p298
aVI used my Jay Turser for guitars and my Dean Playmate for bass. As far as the plugins is concerned I could never get them to work so I decided to run my processor through my computer to get the sound I have now. And I'm still experimenting with Hydrogen drum machine but I'm finding that it has a bunch of different sounds to make it sound more realistic. But I'll definitely look into getting reaper and maybe try the getting the plugins to work again!\u000a
p299
aVProduction's not bad, song itself is cool
p300
asVHere's a new death metal song I just finished. What do you think?
p301
(lp302
VI only listened to the beginning and I like the riffs but the tone isn't good
p303
aVYeah but its the best I was able to get with my $100 recording setup haha :) thanks for the comment
p304
aVYou don't have to have an expensive setup to get a decent sound. If you could tell us what equipment you're using for recording I'm pretty sure we can help. \u000aAlso you should work on humanizing the drums. Especially for snare rolls. They sound really robotic. 
p305
aVThe only piece of equipment I use for recording is my M-Audio Fast Track interface, which came with Pro Tools SE. 
p306
aVYou should be able to get a much better sound for *free*, especially the drums.  Don't be afraid of reverb on the drums, it's the only way to make them sound real, which is most true for those cymbals.  If there's a bass in this recording, feel free to turn it up.  Bass is important, and it's often buried under guitar tones that are too thick, or in this case, too thin and loud.\u000a\u000aAs for the song writing, it's way too melodic and pretty sounding. 
p307
aVI'm going to be completely honest here and disagree with you. Especially on the song writing. Just because its "melodic and pretty sounding," doesn't mean its bad. Thats a matter of personal opinion and if you feel that way then clearly my songwriting style is just not for you.   \u000a  \u000aThe drums do sound pretty fake, but thats because they obviously are. Cant even argue with that one, I'll add some reverb next time. Thanks for that advice.  \u000a  \u000aFor the guitar and bass however, lets be realistic. You are certainly entitled to your opinion, but the guitar and bass tones are really not that bad. Sure, they're not great or professional quality by any means. However, for this song being made in the bedroom of an 18 year old kid in less than a day, its really not that bad. Also, I don't know what kind of speakers you played the song through, but the bass is definitely audible and at a relatively appropriate volume. I listened to it through a 15 year old desktop Dell speaker and I have no trouble hearing it at all.  \u000a  \u000aAnyways, thanks for the comment and taking the time to give my song a listen. 
p308
aVBro. Calm down. The types of riffs you are playing are old school Swedish riffs, which the metal core scene had done to death. Nothing wrong with it, but it has been done to death for a lot of us. \u000a\u000aAs far as your tone, check out Nick crows 8505 plugin with lecab, with some free impulses you can find online. 
p309
aVI'm completely calm, was just giving a response to his criticisms. Thanks for the advice, I will look into that. Although, I'm not sure if my particular interface can use plugins because the software is a limited version of pro tools.
p310
aV&gt; Thats a matter of personal opinion \u000a\u000aObviously. Your shitty pretty music is not my thing. Don't cry about it.  You literally asked for opinions.  I gave mine. \u000a\u000a&gt; The drums do sound pretty fake, but thats because they obviously are. Cant even argue with that one, I'll add some reverb next time. Thanks for that advice. \u000a\u000aTry lowing the sound of the cymbals, and adding reverb to the entire track, plus a *little* bit of compression to pull up the sound of the trailing reverb. Should make it sound a touch more realistic. Also, if your drum machine has a humanizing/timing offset feature, use it.  Perfect drums sound terrible. Tip: rolls are usually played faster than the beat of the track, out of habit. If you were playing live, without a click track, it's almost a guarantee the rolls would be a couple of beats faster than the rest of the track. Humans are weird like that. Computers don't know how to be human-like without human intervention. \u000a  \u000a&gt; its really not that bad\u000a\u000aA bit of attention to detail could have made the track a thousand times more listenable.  The guitar tones are really high in the gain department, something that's usually frowned upon in the melodic death metal genre. Listen to some old At The Gates and see what I'm talking about.  Thicker tones *will* sound better.\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt; the bass is definitely audible\u000a\u000aI can hear the bass, but the tones are all fucked up and it hides the bass tones.  Seriously, don't be afraid to turn up the bass, and turn down the guitars.  Turn down the cymbals, too.
p311
aVVery good job. I liked all aspects of it, although the bass could have been more prominent.
p312
aVPretty awesome man! I wasn't a huge fan of the melodic intro. The phrasing felt a little... Off? In not really sure how to describe it. But after the vocals kick in, I was definitely feeling it. The vocals reminded me of something DevilDriver/Arch Enemy-like. Overall, a very cool song with some really cool riffs and drums.
p313

aVThat was pretty tight. I like what you were trying to accomplish but it was just too artificial.\u000aAdd a rhythm guitar, up the bass a bit, and make those drums a bit deeper, and you have yourself some fucking metal.

The songwriting is really up my alley and some of the better stuff I've heard recently.\u000a\u000aSome constructive criticism about the mix on your first song:\u000a\u000aA LOT of your audible spectrum is living in the trebles of your cymbals. They're slightly overpowering the guitar tracks (which in this case should be the feature) and, in my opinion, don't sit tightly in the mix. My suggestion would be to bring back the level of your overheads a bit and maybe roll off some of the treble on the cymbal tracks. I would suggest trying one, then the other, then both if you're not getting the sound you like. The rest of the drums seem to fit alright so this is the only suggestion I have there. \u000a\u000aOther than that I might suggest boosting the bass a bit. You don't want it too overpower the guitars but to add to them so that the seem to have more resonance and add some power to the mix. Boost carefully a couple dB at a time while listening to the entire track to find a sweet spot.\u000a\u000aThe crossfade at the beginning is awesome. You might try boosting the guitars a little more smoothly as their level seems to "jump" a little once they take over the mix. This might also be caused if you're dropping off the strings immediately rather than crossfading them out. Either way right at about :23 there's a noticeable boost in the waveform that tells me somethings not happening as smoothly as you might like. \u000a\u000aI'm not hearing the kick too much. If I really listen it's there but it's being overpowered by both the lower end of the bass and the trebles in your guitar and cymbals. My suggestion would be to see if you can carve out a niche for it in those areas of the eq. Solo the kick track and boost the eq with a narrow band. Sweep until you find a sweet spot where it sounds really good then mark that spot. Normalize the EQ again for the track and try dragging out a little space in the eq of the other tracks. This way it has some room to breathe and come through more audibly.\u000a\u000aFor the second track:\u000a\u000aCymbals seem to be almost the opposite here. A little too diminished volume and not as airy as the other track. The hi-hat especially I had a hard time picking out at certain points. All in all I think it just needs a little more focus and tweaking.\u000a\u000aThe kick and guitars sound great and there's a good balance with the bass as well. Only suggestion here is that the bass is a little limp style wise. It mostly follows the guitars but doesn't come through as a separate instrument so the rhythm guitar sounds a little woofy (that's a musical term if I've ever made one up). Maybe try adding a little variation to the part to make it stand out.\u000a\u000aNote that I'm making these judgements based only on listening through my macbook speakers and they might not be referencing very well. \u000a\u000aAll in all I really like your stuff. Good work!
p342
aVWow thanks, I wasn't expecting such in-depth criticisms. Basically we are aware the mix needs work, since we're just practicing, but thanks for the feedback on both topics (songwriting and production). We felt the same way about the bass too, there are pretty nifty bass riffs that are almost invisible due to overpowering but we're definitely going to try all these things out. Thanks for taking the time!
p343
aVAs with any recording project it'll take a lot of work to get something perfect. But you definitely have a great musical foundation to build upon. It really is great work man.

aVI have a little bit of background but am by no means an expert. This stuff is right up my alley though so you definitely have my support!
p346
aVWow man.  Just wow haha.  Really good stuff.  Sorta reminds me of Animals as Leaders, but obviously unique in its own way.  Not sure what instrument you are playing what with your buddy in the mix and all, but whatever it is you're shredding haha.  Really digging the use of melodic riffs with solid rhythmic backing.  Sounds really good.  You on Twitter?
p347
aVHaha thanks so much. Animals as Leaders was actually my friend's (the drummer, I play the strings) musical mentor for the longest time so we tried to create a similar sound without coming off as just a cover band haha. The part at 1:07 in Higher Up was basically "hey wanna do an animals as leaders kind of thing?"\u000a\u000aWe aren't on twitter, but we're trying to get more motivated to actually throw more music out there so we might be soon. Kind words like yours make it pretty easy to get motivated so thanks a fuck ton. 
p348
aVNo prob man. I'm a musician too so I try to get around and check out what everyone else is doing. I'm always amazed by how great people sound.

asVWriters block
p363
(lp364
Vi think this is a really good start, def has an interesting sound/vibe.  i would maybe try to rework the last part into a heavier, more drawn out groove.  after the intro from 0:35-0:45 i kinda expect something heavier, like this is where the body of your song should be.  maybe continue to incorporate that punchy distorted tone.
p365
aVthank you :) i am trying to progress that section now, cheers for the help
p366
aVWhen I hit writers block on a particular song I move onto another song.  Then come back to the stuck one later with a fresh perspective.  Sometimes a newer perspective too influenced by what I listened to during the down time.

aVThe guitar work is pretty sweet. I would personally prefer a little more composition in the leads, I mean, the rhythms are so well composed, why short yourself on the leads? \u000a\u000aRhythm parts are solid, you have leads, which, I respect a lot, so many bands don't even try to do it because it's ... not cool anymore? \u000a\u000aThe guitar tone ain't my thing, as are the drums, but the song and the playing are great. The drum parts are good, but I wasn't a fan of the mix of the drums. \u000a\u000aI get that it's a sketch, maybe that's not an important detail and I'm being a nitpicky doucheballoon, and if that is the case, I apologize.\u000a\u000aSweet riffs, keep the nose to the grindstone friend!

(lp441
VI listened to a couple of the other tracks, and I liked them more. If you played the songs a little tighter, and focused on a slightly better production, I think you'd have a decent release.  Using only one guitar track really hurts the production. I think if you recorded two guitar tracks and panned them, you'd have a better, punchier recording. 
p442
aVThanks.  I agree on all counts.  I didn't double track the guitar and I intentionally didn't feel particularly compelled to fix the burden of various small mistakes all over the place...it's a crust EP.   This is a rough mix though, the final version will have somewhat better production.\u000a\u000aIn fact I'm a little miffed that I decided to record this with such a sterile studio setup cause it makes it hard to achieve a nice cohesive, hazy grind sound, and I have to play perfectly since the instruments have a lot of clarity.  That's not really in the spirit of crust/grind.  Don't have much of a choice as a solo musician though.

aVReally like all the tapping stuff in the song, flows right along with everything else, it's got a very bouncy feel!\u000a\u000aI've been needing to develop my tapping technique some more, do you have any exercises/licks/videos you've seen that have helped you?
p455
aVWhat helped me was learning lots of Protest the Hero and The Human Abstract stuff. Both bands' guitarists tend to incorporate a lot of really technical tapping techniques that experiment with skipping strings and goofy patterns that almost make the most sense from a percussive perspective.\u000a\u000aLearn the techniques, then try applying them to what you want to hear. Glad you liked the track!

aVMake me think of if Periphery, Shogun-Era Trivium and Pantera had a wonderful metal baby. Protest the Hero influence is clear as well.

aV-core influences are awesome if you actually have some musicality in the song instead of just open string chugging. And you clearly know what you're doing.

aVIts alright, but its just too twangy\u000a\u000aStratocaster was my first guitar tho. Good guitar, but not the best for someone that wants to play death metal.
p478
aVYeah, if you turn the gain up though it's not as twangy at all. But if you do that the recording quality suffers. It actually sounds better than my Jackson, but that has Duncan Designed pickups
p479
aVYour trying to choke a 100+ watt head and play it at bedroom volumes. The head simply isn't designed for this. Personally I think it sounds thin, too much high end (5k plus).\u000a\u000aTry this:\u000a\u000a* Start at noon on all knobs and your output to your desired recording level\u000a* Actually mix the amp to sound a bit dark, you can always boost frequencies later\u000a* Compress the signal slightly post, shelf at 6-7k and roll off below 60-100hz\u000a* Run your L+R tracks to a stereo bus and then Comp,EQ, ect. \u000a\u000aI've been able to make cigarette amps sound good doing this. 
p480
aVIt sounds thin because I was using a Strat. Also I was trying to go for the old Metallica tone, which is not very dark. If you like I shall upload another recording with my LTD that has EMG pickups?
p481
aVNo need - even with a strat you can filter out most of that top endy stuff that was present. \u000a\u000aMore or less the point I was trying to make is that your technique after the microphone could be updated and setting the amp a little darker cleans things up.

asVMetal Theory #1, pt. 2: Iced Earth - Dante's Inferno (x-post from r/metal)
p490
(lp491
V(continued from post)\u000a\u000aSo this is where I'm fast forwarding a bit. They're definitely building up to the climactic section of the song, with some of the fastest riffing heard so far, but for the most part it's new content generated from the concepts that have appeared earlier in the song. We've got some Db Phrygian, and when the vocals come back in, B harmonic minor, and then back to Eb Phrygian. The part from 13:36 to 14:38 has some tonal ambiguity, which builds tension into what I consider to be the climax of the piece ("Lucifer! Angel of Light!"), a straightforward, heavy-ass Eb Phrygian riff. And that tone space is largely how they wrap up the song, with some tritones thrown in for good measure and a rhythmic buildup over a fade out.  \u000a\u000aConclusions: The main driving force of "Dante's Inferno" is modal progression, which is a very elegant solution to the problems involved in creating a long-form heavy metal song. Staying in a single key space and modality for 16 minutes would be extremely monotonous, but changing key would also require changing bass, which would mean that the guitarists wouldn't have the same access to that ultra-heavy sound created by riffing on the open sixth string. By having the song progress modally, with different scales centered tonally on Eb, they get the variety necessary to carry the song forward without losing access to that low Eb. Specifically, we've got natural minor, harmonic minor, Phrygian, Locrian, diminished, and chromatic. Later on in the song, once the various modal possibilities of Eb have been explored, they allow themselves to move away from that, creating tone spaces that contrast with the Eb heaviness, increasing the impact when they land back on it at the end of the song. \u000a\u000aThe other interesting thing to look at is the form of the song. It's through-composed, which means that there are no repeating sections, as there would be in a more traditional verse-chorus structure. There are ideas that get repeated within their own sections, but at no point does the song return to ideas that were used earlier. Through-composition is the structure of choice for the tone poem, the genre of orchestral music that gained prominence in the late Romantic period. The most widely known is probably Strauss's "Also sprach Zarathustra," the opening of which served as the theme for the movie 2001. A tone poem is a musical setting of some sort of extra-musical concept, usually a poem or story or some other narrative. Although tone poems are strictly instrumental, given the form and the subject matter, "Dante's Inferno" is effectively a heavy metal tone poem. 
p492
aVAwesome work once again!  Was a fun read and a fun song!\u000a\u000a[Link to Iced Earth - Dante's Inferno](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-S7MF6xhb4) for the lazy.\u000a\u000aI have some suggestions:\u000a\u000aBranch out from harmonic analysis and get some rhythmic and lyrical stuff in there... and if you do... maybe pick shorter songs to make the work load manageable.\u000a\u000aLook at the connection between lyric and composition... your findings there will be a great discussion point as they will be much more opinion based than the 'matter of fact' analysis you have done so far.\u000a\u000aPerhaps try some different formatting ideas... having a paragraph per riff as you have is a good idea but maybe start each paragraph with a few bullet points of key information... like key changes, chords, tempo... followed by your more detailed descriptions.... this just makes it easier to pick out key points while listening to the track... it wasn't really a problem with this track but faster songs would be a pain in the ass to keep up with.\u000a\u000aSome diagrams wouldn't hurt!  Notation and tab would make some ideas much easier to convey.\u000a\u000aAnd finally, a song suggestion:  [Crotalus Horridus Horridus by Serpentine Path](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJnPDpKlt4w).
p493
aVThanks! And thanks for posting the link to the song. Forgot to do that on this one.\u000a\u000aExcellent suggestions. I'd definitely like to focus on other aspects than just harmony in future analyses. That just seemed like the best way to approach this particular song. And I'm certainly going to change up the formatting. In retrospect, I don't think the riff-by-riff approach works especially well, both from a readability and comprehensibility standpoint. It's thorough, but I end up repeating myself a lot ("Here's an Eb Phrygian riff... and another one... and another one..."), and while it's interesting, it doesn't add much to the overall understanding of the song relative to the amount of time spent on it. My plan for the future is to hone in on maybe 1-3 interesting aspects of the music from the get-go, and highlight parts of the music that exemplify that. I might still use the bullet point approach to deliver some general structural information, if I think that would be necessary or helpful. \u000a\u000aI'll definitely bring in some notation for the next one. I might look into the lyrics a little bit more, but lyrics just aren't something I connect with in most music, and understanding or analyzing them definitely wouldn't be my strong point. That might be a good place for the subreddit communities to pick up the slack in the comments section.\u000a\u000aAnd thanks for the suggestion. Serpentine Path is one of those albums I checked out, listen to, really enjoyed, and haven't been back to since. That would give me a good excuse to get re-acquainted with it.

asVQuestions about using Reaper as my DAW?
p498
(lp499
VOoh! Something I can help with! I've been using REAPER as my main DAW for a few years now and love it. $60 is 1000% worth it in my opinion if you're considering purchasing. Some other users have answered your questions already but I'll throw my two cents in anyway:\u000a\u000a1) In short, yes, REAPER supports VSTs, both 32 and 64-bit. It also supports DX and JS plugins, and has Rewire support (You can run REAPER as a plugin inside another DAW or another DAW with Rewire inside REAPER).\u000a\u000a2) Yep, REAPER has a whole suite of (optional) plugins that come with the software for free. There's an EQ, compressor, a couple different kinds of reverb, a delay, pitch shifter, etc. etc. All in all there's about 20 plugins included. They're pretty barebones, and don't have much of a UI to speak of, but they're very lightweight CPU-wise and sound pretty good. Most of them have a few very useful presets too, if you're into that sort of thing.\u000a\u000a3) Nope, your track/effect count is only limited by your computer's hardware/ability to play back piles of audio!\u000a\u000a4) Unfortunately REAPER only comes with one software instrument, a little synthesizer you can shape the sound of manually. I personally never use it, haven't found much of a use for it yet. I suppose they were trying to keep the install light on your machine, and not include 3rd party stuff that comes with licensing problems. Here are some places I've had good luck finding some free VSTs and soundfonts:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.kvraudio.com/\u000ahttp://hammersound.net/cgi-bin/soundlink.pl\u000a \u000a\u000aHope this helps!

aV+1\u000a\u000aReaper is an incredibly flexible DAW that I gravitated towards because it did support all my plugins and it's super easy to use. Try it out for free; 60 bucks is not a lot of money.

aVI can't answer your questions, but you can download and try Reaper for free to evaluate it
p502
aVYou're right, I'll do that actually and have a look! Cheers!

aVShort answer: yes, yes, no, and no. But KVR is a good place to look for plugins. Also, search for DSK soundfont player and some soundfonts for decent, free virtual instruments.

aV1) yes it does support vst. and runs them great \u000a2)yes it has built in eq. \u000a3) no track limit that im aware of \u000a4) i dont believe there are built in strings but there is a synth..better left to 3rd party vsts.\u000a\u000areaper is amazing and would recommend it to anyone looking to record music.

That way you can scale as necessary and yet have lighter pieces. 50 watts should be plenty loud for almost anything.\u000a\u000aTwo friends recently got this amp for the same reason. They're light, and sound great.
p529
aVI mostly play smaller bars &amp; DIY spaces, some with PAs, some without. My last head was 350w, so 50w might be little less than I'm accustomed to, but thanks for the input!
p530
aVYeesh, 350 watts? That's huge. \u000a\u000aSeriously, 50 or 100 watts will be plenty enough for DIY spaces and smaller venues. I usually play similar venues.
p531
aVMy 50 watt valve head is easily loud enough. I play similar metal gigs too, so imagine you wouldn't have a problem with something that size.
p532
aVThanks!
p533
aVYou mean 350w solid state correct?\u000a\u000a50w Tube should be more than enough for that size room. \u000a\u000aYour going to miss your cab, most combos are open back and you won't get as much compression on your low end and it will become loose.
p534
aVInteresting, it is solid state, I didn't realize there was such a difference between solid state &amp; tube when it came to sound level.
p535
aVAs a rough estimate, use a 4:1 Ratio. \u000a\u000aYour 350w solid state would be comparable to a 87.5w Tube head. \u000a\u000aSo if you never had the solid state pegged, a 50w all tube amp should be plenty loud enough for your application. \u000a\u000aIf you did have it pegged - go for the 100w.

aVAwesome, thanks!

aVCame here just to suggest this amp with the 2x12's. Works great. \u000a\u000aIf you want even lighter - Orange Dark Terror can do the job, 15 watts may not seem like a lot but it will move some air.

p563
(lp564
VA little reverb will help. You could experiment with slight echoes or chorus effects, as well as mixing the vocals to both sides of the mix equally as opposed to centering them. Getting full sounding vocals isn't actually that hard, the hard part tends to be balancing between "full" vocals and ones that become a bit too spacey. 
p565
aVI like to multitrack vocals, pan a track mostly left and one mostly right and cut the track volume and add a bit of reverb. If you don't feel like tracking the same parts three times you could always duplicate the tracks and mess with the track delay a couple milliseconds until they're out of phase.
p566
aVHrm... Dave's vocals in the Morbid Angel song seem to just be boosted with reverb (and maybe some compression), and the vocals in that Psychotic Waltz song sound like they've got some subtle chorus on them.  As for in the Baroness track, it's definitely some sort of reverb, especially since you can hear a little pre-delay in there (i.e. a reversed reverb effect).

p581
(lp582
VOk. I actually like your voice man. I don't think you sound as bad as 'you' think you do. I'm guilty of that myself. Your issue isn't "we need to find someone that can sing", your issue is "we need to figure out how to make these vocals best sit in the mix". There are tons of blogs and websites you can google to get EQ tips, etc. For your takes, sing with passion, sing with confidence, alternate between power and restrained with the flow of the music. You don't have to sing like Freddie Mercury to be a great vocalist. Look at like...Neil Young. Dude is NOT a good singer. He's just expresses his honesty/passion. And, that's ALL it really comes down to. Good Luck. 
p583
aVThere are a lot of tutorials online. Drone and doom are pretty straightforward genres. I listened to your takes and could barely hear the vocals, could you maybe turn down the guitars almost all the way down? I'd love to be able to hear the vocals and give you normal criticism.\u000a\u000aVocals are usually compressed once you've decided on a take. You can try sidechaining too. It makes the volume process automatic. You set how far you want to decrease the guitar volume in relation to the vocals.
p584
aVAlso donc forget that mastering comes after the mixing step, and anyway will crush down the dynamics. It means, if your mix is done properly, that the volume of the instruments will be lower when the voice comes in.\u000a\u000aBy the bay I liked your singing. It's not my style but it sounded ok to me. Reminded me of Ghost in a way.

aVi have noticed that about the lead, and that has always been a problem for me. i can get everything else to fit together, but i always happen to make the leads too loud. the lead, except the solo over the clean section, are being played as written, so more than likely, the intonation is off. i'll have to recheck that.\u000a\u000ait actually isnt a piano at the 1:50 mark, but in fact is guitar. wasnt my intention to make it sound like a piano, but it was my intention to go for a jazzy kinda feel. jazz is something that i have been trying to incorporate more into my playing, mostly by way of what progressions i'm trying to invoke. i was trying to make the song sound "progressive," but it would seem that my prog abilities need work.\u000a\u000athank you. i will consider all that you said, and will look over things.

VPractice. Songwriting takes a hell of a lot of practice. initially, don't try to have an objective of blending two styles. I think you would need to learn how to write music, and practice to get your own compositional style, before you would try to blend two very different subgenres
p632
aVeverything that is wrong with heavy music these days is contained entirely in this post.\u000a\u000abut, good luck on your musical travels.
p633
aVJust write music and see what comes out, finding your style is also about letting your style find you. Do not worry about blending styles, don't even think in terms of styles, just try to write a bunch of songs and get practice songwriting.
p634
aVWait, sorry but why are you the "main songwriter" if you haven't written a song? Have the others not expressed an interest in writing songs? Not being snarky, just curious how that came about.
p635
aVI am the most musical person. Everything about it is a first for all of us. The job just kind of fell in my lap.
p636
aVFair enough! I would encourage you guys to all give writing a go, however. Some bands do work best with a main songwriter, but others really find their groove through collaboration.
p637
aVI would love if that would work, but sadly, the other guys don't have any theory training in the least. I generally will write something then show it to them, after which they will give me feedback. 
p638
aVKnowledge of theory is, in no way, a requirement when it comes to writing music. You just have to stop thinking in terms of theory when you work with them. Apply to the stuff afterwards or personally, but they don't have to know the theory to make the music. Speaking as a heavily theory inclined person, working with people who don't know it will be simultaneously frustrating and rewarding. Unless you absolutely want to be the lead writer for the music, then encourage them to write too.

p643
(lp644
VGet a metronome.
p645
aV**And always use it.** It's very rare for me to not have a metronome going when I play. Sometimes I shut it of when writing stuff so it isn't distracting, but when I practice it is on 100% of the time.
p646
aVPractice to a metronome and count out loud. Counting out loud may make you feel incredibly stupid at first, but whatever you do, **don't skip over it**. Trust me, I've probably spent enough time on the drums counting the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 more times than I ever counted them in school. My drum teacher hated when I didn't count out loud. He'd make me redo it, and usually I did much better when I sucked it up and said them out loud. Every second of every minute of every hour of every day you spend committing yourself to improving will benefit you for the rest of your life. It's only stupid if it's a waste of your time.
p647
aVPracticing daily to a metronome is obvious.\u000a\u000aThe less obvious one is practice at slow tempos as well.  Being a metal subreddit you're likely to want to play all fast.  Your riffs sound better at the proper tempo if you've also spent time playing them at slow tempos.  Especially if you're tremolo picking a lot.  How is it even going to sound good playing 32nd notes if you can't even tremolo pick quarters or eighths steadily.
p648
aVWhen I play I'm always moving a part of my body along with the tempo. Usually I tap my heel or headbang.
p649
aVObviously practice, practice, practice. Start with a metronome at a slow speed and then increase when you're feeling comfortable. \u000a\u000aAs for guitar playing I personally just write songs,  program some drums for it,  then play along all the time and increase BPMs accordingly. Metronome is too big of a hazzle for me because I play different riffs at different tempos. \u000a

Do you have plans to expand on it, or will you keep it as-is?\u000a\u000aOne thing I'd recommend is maybe easing up on the double bass a bit.  It fits some parts, but it feels gratuitous in others.

My question to you guys is I've a bit conflicted with my mix. In my mind, it doesn't have the same width as it does on the original track. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to boost or subtract or add in order to get it wider? Also what else is wrong with the mix. Any suggestion helps as I become better every time I post here. Also, the guitars are through Pod HD Pro, the drums are SD2, and the bass is through Zombass.
p661
aVThe guitars/bass sound pretty solid and comparable to the original song. I think where you're lacking presence is with the drums, specifically the snare. In my opinion it sounds like it has a little too much high end and not enough mid presence. The guitars could maybe use a bit of left/right panning as well but the rest of it seems relatively close to the original. I think once you get the drums/snare you'll have a pretty sweet mix!

aVI can agree with the snare sounding a bit too thin, but this is even after I eq'd out a lot of the 10khz range... I guess what I can do is use the pitch feature on SD2 to make the snare sound a bit lower to have a better mid range. Thanks! 
p663
aVAlright, [here is the most updated version.](https://soundcloud.com/iuploadmymusic/ragorock-update-3) Improved the snare much. Improved the vocals presence wise as well.
p664
aVI agree that the drums seem to be the weak part. For me, the problem (even in your updated version), is the amount of reverb. It sounds too distant, and a bit like a toy drum kit. But other than that, you did an amazing job.\u000a\u000aCan I ask for a copy of your POD HD patch? :) Guitars sound nice.

aVNow that you mention it, that might exactly be the problem. I'll work on it when I get home. I'll also PM you the guitar tone. Thanks!

asVI tried to go for something with much rawer sounding drums rather than super polished and produced. What do you guys think?
p674
(lp675
Vthis sounds solid dude. the riffs around 1:26 are pretty ridiculous. the drums sound good, but as UltimateSasquatch said, throw some randomness into those drums. in my experience, the trick to programming more "human" sounding drums is to go through your midi clips and slide each MIDI trigger/one shot drum sample slightly to the left or right (earlier or later) from the line on the grid. if you do this tactfully, it would help cut down the roboticness of the 100% perfectly on the grid drums that you currently have (that's my first impression). give it a try man.. i think it could really give the track some more life. also mess with the velocities of a select few of those one shot drum samples.. def gives it a bit more variation.\u000a\u000athis is sweet though dude, definitely keep working on your drum programming skills. there might come a day where you break off from metal (as i did) and delve into some more trippy production stuff. these are really great skills to have.
p676
aVThanks for the feedback! I usually mess with the velocities of the drum notes but mostly when I'm programming fills, blast beats, or repeated cymbal hits so maybe I'll try that trick with the main kick and snare parts as well as moving drums notes over a bit in one direction or the other.
p677
aVI dig.
p678
aVYour tone is getting better but still needs work. Are you high-shelving one of the guitars? One of them should sound really scratchy if you were to play it alone. The drums sound way cooler but you should also try randomizing them.
p679
aVI am high shelving them, I thought that was standard practice and I'm not a huge fan of the how the guitars sound with the higher frequencies left alone. I also agree that the drums could be changed up a bit, the tom samples I made for that "kit" were not very good at all so I didn't use them very much. Usually I program more drum fills in. Thanks for the feedback!

aVAwesome song, and you have some great gear, but you need to practice the song quite a bit more.. Especially using a metronome, slow down that solo, and build up to the full speed. Your tone also seems lacking in some way, and I'm by no means a professional with tone, but it just seems off some how. Put a little more energy into your video too!

asVSide-projects: How many do you really need?
p707
(lp708
VThe way I see it, is that the name of the project is meant to tell the listener (or customer) what they are getting.\u000a\u000aSo, if you just have 1 band/project name, but put out black metal, dungeon synth, and acoustic records under it, you're probably going to annoy or disappoint some fans. The only exception would be if they already know you to be highly eclectic and expect that sort of variety. But most won't.\u000a\u000aFor me, a band name is about a style of music. I anticipate their albums because I am anticipating certain musical aspects that I already know that I like. It's not so much about the personalities behind the band. If they wanted to do something radically different, I would appreciate them using a different name for the project. And that would apply equally to a one-man band as it would to a group of musicians.\u000a\u000aSo, in my opinion, one name per style. Just because you like dungeon synth and electro, don't expect your fans to do so too.

aVI have my main Metal band, but I've started writing for a solo Post-Rock project, just for me to do something else that I'm passionate about.

aVI have multiple projects. These are how I describe them along with bands I'm trying to emulate or combine elements from.\u000a\u000a*Symphonic Death/Doom and Funeral Doom (like Ruins of Beverast, My Dying Bride, and Ahab)\u000a\u000a*Pagan/Black/Folk/Gaze (like Drudkh, Windir, and Alcest)\u000a\u000a*Blackened Death/Melodic Black (like Belphegor, Dissection, and Goatwhore)\u000a\u000a*Chiptune (8 bit music)\u000a\u000a*Other electronic (dubstep, drum and bass, house, gabber)\u000a\u000a*Classical (under my real name)

asVWriting complimentary riffs
p716
(lp717
VI wouldn't over complicate it if it doesn't need to be anything more than what you have, just double the guitar part. I'm a big TBDM fan and a lot of their guitar parts are where both guitars are playing the same kinda riff, but the other is harmonising the melody but playing the same root note where there are some.. If you get me..
p718
aVYou could "deconstruct" the main riff, maybe simplify it and the tweak the tonality so it's in a different harmonic relation and start building the new riff from there. Or use the original riff played at half or double time as a starting point.
p719
aVCan I hear it? I play melodeath and can help you out. You can. Check out some of my old posts if you'd like. If it's harmony/melodic support that you need, I can do that lol. 
p720
aVThanks :) I could do a shitty GarageBand recording of the guitar track later today and chuck it on soundcloud, but the quality won't blow you away. Would that suffice?
p721
aVIt's better than nothing I guess. We can give it a shot. 
p722
aVLearn your scales. It's usually not that hard once you know them. Harmonizing riffs is really just picking out all the notes a certain number of degrees higher than the original. But if I have any kind of useful tip at all: Just because you can harmonize everything, doesn't mean you have to. Sometimes just having a bunch of really huge power chords in unison is way more headbangable than altering the riff a thousands different ways until it's essentially a chord,
p723
aVYeah, I'll try harmonizing a couple more of the riffs. Also, a lot of the commenters, you included, have warned me not to overcomplicate the song, so that seems to be worth paying attention to haha. Cheers though\u000a
p724
aVI mean it's the sort of thing that's become stereotypically metal now, so everyone tries to do it. But some riffs should be harmonized, others shouldn't. A lot of melodeath bands today like to harmonize their pedaled riffs and the more melodic/uplifting passages, but what you don't hear enough of these days are harmonized riffs that sound dark and just creepier when you add the harmony, the way Slayer did it.

VSong is really good, but i think mix is to bassy.

Gmulti (iirc) is a really good, free, and easy to use. Also try /r/audioengineering ( i hope i spelled it right ). People over there will be more insightfull then i am.

p738
aVDamn I would love to have a Kemper :(\u000a\u000aI have an Eleven Rack which I love to death, but you can really do some insane tone matching with a Kemper or an Axe FX.
p739
aVJust find creative ways to make money and sell off everything you don't need! I did an inventory of basically everything in my apartment and sold my old pedals, a guitar, an amp, some unused RAM, a few plugins, and a spare TV. Did some freelance work and logged all my monthly expenses, then cut everything down to what I absolutely needed and bought cheap groceries for the last four or five months. Found a used Kemper on eBay for $1500, which is about what an Axe FX Standard goes for these days. It's doable! 
p740
aVThis is all very awesome and doable for a normal situation, but I just got engaged in November and the big date/honeymoon is early September...so no big purchases for me for a lonnng time buddy :p
p741
aVI just recently bought an axe fx and am thinking about selling it, free vst's are getting me a better distorted sound IMO.  Cab impulses is really the most important part.
p742
aVAxe FX II or Ultra/original? The modeling in the II is definitely much improved from the first version. There are some great VSTs out there, but I find that impulses really fail in the dynamic components of the cab- the physical speaker movement and the thumpy low-end in particular. They sound like what they are, which is static audio files applied to a dynamic tone. I sort of doubt most casual listeners would notice, but that degree of realism, plus the CPU usage, are the reasons I upgraded.
p743
aVOriginal, I knew that this might happen but couldn't afford the II.  Right now Im using Peavey revalver with Poulin Lecab + Guitarhack impulses and Im pretty happy.  At least I got the Axe Fx for a good deal so I could probably make a couple bucks on it.
p744
aVRevalver IV sounds pretty great, but if your CPU can handle it (I'm on a 2.3 ghz dualcore macbook pro from 2011 and it uses 8% on the lowest settings at about 256 samples buffering), I highly recommend Recabinet 4 as well. I don't like the cab modeling much, but it's really focused on crazily accurate emulations of the amps, and the developer is planning 200+ amps over the next 3 years. I had been using that and OwnHammer's mesa rectifier pack, and it sounds 90% as good as the Kemper or Axe II.
p745
aVThe Axe 2 and kemper use impulses as well....unless u run through a real cab which u can also do with Vsts.
p746
aVThis is true. Stuff like s-gear is as good if not better than the axe 2 and kemper. Vsts have come a long way since the axe 2 came out. Still, not selling my mesa tube amp. Nothing sounds/feels like a good tube amp.
p747
asVI found this sub through a friend, and for my first post here, I figured I'd share a song of mine with everyone. What do you guys think?
p748
(lp749
VGood stuff dude. I would maybe consider dropping the drums down just a hair in the mix, they sound like they are sitting just above everything else. Still, good work and nice riffs. 
p750
aVThanks. =) I've had a couple of people tell me that about the drums, and after listening to it through a few different speakers, I agree. I'll probably tweak them when I go home tonight.
p751
aVSounds good dude!\u000aPerhaps try using some more variation in the velocites of the kick drums or use more than one kick sample, but that's just nitpicking.
p752
aVI probably should have put in a disclaimer that I am not a drummer by any stretch of the imagination, so the beats I paste together sometimes don't sound too original. =P And I completely agree with you about using more than one kick sample, but all I have to work with is what I got from my brother's synth for the time being. I wish I had a better recording program than ACID, because at the very least I'd have liked to drop every other kick sound down by a few cents so they at least *sounded* different, but...y'know, ACID. -_-

p792
aVI think what you want to hear is that what you're doing has potential enough to be a band that makes worthwhile music. It is. There were some pretty cool riffs in there. The sound is very oldschool, and in a pleasing way. What did you use to record this? \u000a\u000aThe criticisms I have is that the drums are very unmixed, all I can hear is the snare. The snare sounds great! But I think the music would benefit from more clarity in the cymbals. Also, this is a very straightforward sounding band.

p801
aVLet me know as well how you got that tone, please. I'm also using TSE x50 v2, but I have not managed to get such a kick-ass tone. 
p802
aVOkay here's the dirt (/u/hs94 also): \u000a\u000aAMP (the x50 is just a 5150 sim, so roughly the same would apply to the Nick Crow 7170 I think): Red channel, pre gain 2, low 2.5, mid 8, treble 8, post gain 3.25, low end 6, presence 9, impulse is guitarhack666 (comes with the X50) with length/movement set to 100%. Red mod is not turned on. Tubes are 6L6 and bias is at 12 o'clock.\u000a\u000aSTOMP: Overdrive 0, balance 3 o'clock, tone 3 o'clock.\u000a\u000aEQ: -5db smallish bell at 52 hz to make room for kick (just in case anything makes it past the high pass filter); high pass/low pass to taste (I have it at 65 and 9500 hz, respectively), broad 3db cut at 275, narrow boost of 1.5 db at 1189 (just enough to be heard in the mix), -4db at 3777 to make room for kick click. \u000a\u000aOTHER STUFF: 3.5 db of SSL 4000 saturation from the Slate VCC. \u000a\u000aI'm using an LTD 7-string with EMG actives. :) \u000a\u000aAs for the rest of my mix, my bass is a turd, so I spent a lot of time manually riding the volume and cutting strategically to make the kick heard. Drums are the Metal Machine EZX. I did very little to the individual kit pieces except hollowing out the toms, cutting the sustain and boosting the attack of the kick with a transient designer and scooping out a lot around 200hz, and put a lot of Slate VCC and about 2db worth of the Slate VBC on the drum bus. Also a parallel compression bus to add some snap, and barely enough of the room mic to add some weight to the toms, snare, and overheads. No kick bleed except a teeny bit for the snare bottom and overhead mics.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you guys have any other questions, and thanks again! I'm still not satisfied with the kick-bass balance, but that's because I'm using a total cheapo bass with huge resonant nodes haha.
p803
aVThe intro was painful. But the rest of the song blew me out of my chair. That was incredible. I would recommend cutting out the intro, at least until the part where multiple guitars come in. Good freaking job. 
p804
aVI'll have to disagree with this. I thought the intro was awesome and built up nicely. 
p805
aVHoly shit...that was fucking rad. 
p806
aVNice dude. Mix sounded pretty good, well done!
p807
aVOkay, how the hell did you record the acoustic guitars? Good sound, but like you said the bass's presence is too low. 
p808
aVIn my apartment with a cheap, cheap MXL 991 microphone haha. High pass filter to cut out the boominess and I equalized the volume of each note to within an inch of its life manually. A few standard cuts around 250 to cut a bit of mud and around 700 hz to cut the boxiness. I actually cleaned the acoustic neck about a month ago with oil soap and forgot to put lemon oil back on so the neck was super dry, which made the tone weird. I'm cheap so I refused to buy new strings haha. Then I just added a touch (1-3 db max) of compression, some saturation, and reverb.\u000a\u000aAs for the bass, yeah it's a Sterling Sub bass. I had the nut widened and tuned it to BEAD, so there are some strange resonances that are deep and thick, which is nice for the lows, but can get obnoxious-sounding. If you EQ them out, though, the bass is awful, so I did the best I could. Looking to sell it and get a schecter 5-string when I have the cash.

aVThis sounds great, vocals could be stronger though.  I'm definitely following you on bandcamp now though, i can always use more of the riff.
p830
aVI use VST's for everything in my music besides raw guitar signal (via Rocksmith cable). I must confess, I use some pirated software; however the free alternatives to most expensive VST's aren't bad. \u000a\u000aFor Guitar:\u000aI use Guitar Rig 5 most of the time, but I like to experiment with TH2 and Amplitube 3. Free alternatives are LePou's plugins; they're nearly as good. A typical signal chain is Guitar -&gt; Gtune (tuner plugin) -&gt; Guitar Rig 5 -&gt; any post effects for mixing like compression/eq plugins. \u000a\u000aMy signal chain in Guitar Rig is usually pretty simple for a metal rhythm/lead sound. I start with noise reduction (my cable isn't perfect) and then go into a compressor to make harmonics and other quiet sounds a bit louder. Next I go through an EQ which I use to cut around 800hz and add a bit around 2khz, as well as cutting most frequencies below 80-100hz (those are exclusively for bass). Then I go through a tube screamer (max volume, 0 distortion, tone to taste) and then through the amp head. I use the Gratifier head (replica of the Dual Rectifier) and set it to about 3-4 gain (maybe more if you have passive pickups) 5 bass, 11 mid, 7-8 treble, and full presence. Then I go into an orange 4x12 style cab. For leads, I add delay and reverb to taste depending on the sound I'm going for. \u000a\u000aI've been using my 8 string tuned to drop E, so this sound is designed to be clear in the low end yet still heavy. For a standard or less lowered tuning you could probably get away with more distortion, but don't go overboard.  \u000a\u000aFor bass: I like to use Trillian bass module, but it's a massive CPU hog. As an alternative I use Shreddage Bass. I run it through Guitar Rig similarly to the guitar. I won't go into specifics, but it's EQ'ed around the guitar so they use different frequencies. \u000a\u000aFor drums: I use Superior Drummer 2. I must admit, I usually go overboard on the drums and have kits with 30-40 pieces and 16 mic outs. But it's fun. \u000a\u000aFor keyboards/other: I use Kontakt's default factory library for a lot of stuff. I also use Cubase's synth modules it comes with. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately I don't have a current example of my sounds in a mix, but I did make a song a while back using Shreddage 2 as a MIDI guitar using similar (but not quite as polished) effects as I stated above. I dislike how fake the MIDI guitar sounds, but ehh. http://youtu.be/uOtdGg6PLiw\u000a\u000aSorry for the wall of text :S I was bored.

p832
aVNo problem, and thanks for the kind words! I'd be glad to help if you need any advice in the future.
p833
aVThere's very little magic involved. The VSTs these days are so good that it's hard to get it wrong. The settings are almost irrelevant, because like a real amp, it's subjective and people like different settings.\u000a\u000aGet guitar. Select bridge pickup, ensure tone knob and volume knob are set to full.\u000a\u000aPlug it into interface. You should be using a high-impedence input for best results. Ensure the interface is outputting a loud enough signal. You can check this on the interface or your software, depending on what is available to you. You should never be clipping but if you have lights on the meter you should be roughly in the yellow zone.\u000a\u000aPick an amp VSTi (one of the LePou ones maybe, or TSE, or the old Nick Crow ones if you like). Set the EQ levels all to mid/12'o'clock for now. Ensure you're on a Lead channel, turn gain down to something like 10% and master volume to something fairly low too. Play into it and adjust the gain to suit. Also adjust master volume, both to compensate as you turn up the gain and to ensure the output is loud enough. Again, use the meters to check the level.\u000a\u000aPick a cab sim/impulse loader, and load an impulse. Alter the volume to compensate for any loss (or gain) of loudness, and see how it sounds. Don't like it? Try another one. There are many good impulses available on the Andy Sneap forums. Or the Rewirez ones (http://www.redwirez.com/free1960g12m25s.jsp). If you don't know where to start, pick one that says SM57 because that is likely to be a sound that is familiar to you.\u000a\u000aAt that point, you're potentially done. You might want to drop a Tube Screamer VST in front of the amp vst (usually with the Drive value down at zero or near zero) to clean up the bottom end, and sometimes you want EQ or a filter to reduce fizzy top end as well.\u000a\u000aThe main thing is to make sure your gain staging is right (good amplitude levels at each stage of the chain) and not to make any dumb mistakes (eg. taking a stereo signal and only amplifying one of the two paths, putting the cab ahead of the amp, etc).\u000a\u000aBeyond that, if you don't think the sound is 'good', you'll have to give more information and I'm sure someone can help.
p834
aVAwesome explanation, best comment here imo.\u000a\u000aI have a few questions though. How can a get a tighter sound? I'm using LePu amp, with a 808 OD, and throwing an impulse in for good measure, but my distortion is like, all over the place. The actual gain is set to 12'o clock, and if i lower it my guitar just sounds weak.\u000a\u000aAny tips on tightening up my sound? How would i mess w/ EQ?
p835
aV'Tightening' is a very vague term. Certainly if the problem is too much distortion then no EQ is going to help. Probably the first thing to do is put a noise gate on there so that it's not making as much noise between notes, but to help further I'd have to know exactly what you think your problem is.
p836
aVDo you mean tone as in synth sounds or tone for your guitar?
p837
aVYes, guitar tone specifically. I probably should have mentioned that haha
p838
aVHere you go http://www.vst4free.com/index.php?dev=LePou\u000a\u000aAll the LePou plugins are great.  My favorites are LeCto and Le456.  Each one is modeled after different real world gear.  You'll probably want to filter off some of the high end, it can get really noisy if you have a lot of gain on your input signal.
p839
aVThere are some really good guitar amp VSTs, completely free.  I'll try to find you a download link.

asVAnyone here use Hydrogen for drums?
p841
(lp842
V[I use Hydrogen.](https://soundcloud.com/vincent_wisehoon/rot) With the right samples, it's a very feasible tool for metal. First off, it makes way more sense to start with a drum track and then record the guitars for it than vice versa. Your drum tracks probably aren't going to line up with your guitar playing, even if you used a click track. Trust me when I say it sounds way more natural. \u000a\u000aStart one riff at a time. When the song starts, do you want drums right away? Do you know when you want them to come in? How much? How gradually? If you want silence in the beginning (or any part for that matter) use an unused drum hit, or add a sound of your own and put it on each beat when there is silence elsewhere, and export it as a separate track. Now you have something to follow and play along in sync with even when there are no drum patterns to follow.\u000a\u000aAs for coming up with drum patterns, I trust that just listening to some of your favorite grooves and paying close attention to drum tracks in general should be enough to figure out what works with you. However, if you're completely clueless, There are a few basic rules that will get you pretty far as a beginner: Stick the snare on a consistent beat (either on the two/four or one/three for more of an aggressive marching metal sound) and then fill in which beats are important with the kick. You should always have something else playing to fill in the sound. Example: Try making a blast beat in Hydrogen with just the snare and kick. Sounds like crap right? Now add hat hits on each beat, and it will sound a lot better. Now, it will still sound robotic without randomization of pitch, velocity, humanization (which actually works pretty well in Hydrogen) and switching up different samples of the same hit, but you're getting the idea now: Set a tempo with the snare, groove with the kick, add "perceived speed" with either the high-hat or ride bell or whatever, then accent special parts of each measure with crashes, and do fills with toms.\u000a\u000aAs for the more technical procedures, just watching a few short instructional videos on youtube (any one will do really) on beginners drumming tips will help. Look up stuff like "how to make a drum beat", "how to make drum fills", or "how to build better coordination for drumming."\u000a\u000aIt takes a lot of careful tone adjustment, and of course, mixing and mastering to get it to sound right, but it definitely can be done.
p843
aVThanks these are great tips! I already get my riffs organized and then play them over the drums to see if they fit ahead of time so I know this riff can be done but I can't get the timing right in Hydrogen and I can't seem to get a fitting beat going, 
p844
aVAs /u/SolomonKull said in another comment, you should really be writing your riffs to drum tracks, or at the very least, to a click track/metronome (I sometimes save the drum part until last if I want to experiment with it, or just can't come up with something at first).\u000a\u000aAs for using Hydrogen to program drums, it can definitely be done for metal - I used to use it until I upgraded to using Toontrack's drum machine software/sample packs.  In addition to what /u/UltimateSasquatch said, you'll want to look for sample packs that include multiple hits for each drum (e.g. a pack with 10-20 samples of the same snare drum being hit in different ways).  This will help you to avoid the all-too-common issue of drum machines and triggered drum kits, where every hit for each drum sounds exactly the same, and will allow you to imitate the natural variations in a drum's sound that come from it being struck hard, softly, etc.  This requires you to tweak the velocity of each hit, which can be done in Hydrogen down the bottom of the window, under the drum sequencer itself.\u000a\u000aHere's [an example](https://soundcloud.com/sinndogg/wip-song-010914) from a song I've been working on over the last few days, which shows what I mean (I used Toontrack's Metal Machine samples in conjunction with their EzDrummer software, but the same ideas still apply).  If you listen to the snare drum, for example, you'll notice that I've reduced the volume on off-beat hits, during blast beats, at certain points in fills, etc., to imitate the way that a live drummer would play things - no drummer is going to always be hitting the drum at the exact same velocity, especially when playing fast, and if you spend a bit of time working at it, you can get a decent approximation of those sorts of dynamics.  The almost drum-rollish bit on the snare in the final section (0:54 onwards) is a good example of what I mean, even if I think that the on-beat hit in the middle is a bit loud (I've reduced the volume of that hit since uploading).\u000a\u000aA good way to work out how to do this is to listen to albums where there's little to no triggering on the drums, and listen for these sorts of dynamics where they appear.  It's pretty obvious that drummers are going to be hitting their snare drums more softly during blast beats, because you just can't hit as hard when you're playing fast, but what about during drum fills or grooves?  It can take a bit of getting used-to, and will definitely mean a bit more time spent on drum programming per song, but it will really help to remove some of the artificial sound that comes with using a drum machine (you'll notice that most bands that use drum machines don't bother with tweaking velocity, or use drum machines/programs that don't have that feature built in, so it tends to be glaringly obvious).\u000a\u000aThere's a pretty good collection of drum samples that you can use for metal [here](http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/backline/529782-sharing-my-collection-drum-samples-here.html), with loads of hits for each drum in most cases.  It may take some work to get them sounding right in your mix, and a lot of the bass drum samples are weak on their own, but they're a good first step if you're not able to afford something like EzDrummer/Superior Drummer or Addictive Drums.
p845
aVWhy the hell are you recording drum tracks after guitar? You need to play the guitar to the drum track...\u000a\u000aWrite the guitar tracks, then write the drum tracks, then record the drum tracks, then record the guitar tracks.\u000a
p846
aVHaha I re recorded that segment to match the drums as best as I could, it's the drum beat that's fucked, it's faster than I want it to be yet the accents lie almost exactly where I want them. 
p847
aVObvious, *obviously* you play guitars to the drum track. There will never be a problem if you play your guitar tracks over the drum tracks. If the drum track is too fast, change the tempo. You didn't just record guitar tracks without a metronome *or* a drum track, did you?  You should always play the guitar parts over the drum track, and you'll never have any problems with tempo... You should know the timing of your tracks because you literally created them. If you're playing a song that isn't 4/4 then you're not going to be able to track drum with a 4/4 timing. 
p848
aVAgreed.  It's a good idea to spend some time working out exactly what time signatures your riffs are played in as you come up with them, and play along to a metronome/click track set to the tempo that you want to play it in (or, at the very least, record to a pre-existing drum track).  If you can't count it out, then *definitely* spend some time learning about the basics of time signatures and musical measures.

aV55SH is a classy looking mic, but it is literally the exact same as a SM58. If you want to spend around $300 and only use it in a studio setting, get the SM-7B. If you plan on spending a lot less and using it live as well, pick up a Shure BETA-58 or SM-58 if you budget is even tighter. \u000a\u000aScatmanjawn just released a vocal cover of Ruin by Lamb of God using nothing but a Beta 58.

aVSM57 will always do the trick for harsh vocals.

asVWhat do your guitars sound like before your final mixing?
p869
(lp870
VI barely do anything to my distorted guitars to be honest, if anything I'll take stuff away EQ-wise. Try and get your tone right at the source! 
p871
aVI can get a SUPERRR gnarly guitar sound on its own and then everything else comes in and it's like... eh... s'alright I guess. Think it might be the drums?
p872
aVPossibly. I generally think of guitars as a huge blanket that covers anything and everything. Distorted guitars eat up so much frequency real-estate it's crazy. You may want to try cutting out some low end to let your kick/bass come through. Cutting some mud at around 350-5/600Hz *might* be a shout as well. It depends on your instrumentation. Cutting too much can be a bad thing though. A low pass filter can actually tighten up your tone as well as it can remove high-end fizzle, but this is much less of a 'general guideline' than the high pass. Try and make sure everything else is fucking great and then fit your guitars around it by chopping shit out of them. 
p873
aVI agree with cutting the low end. If you want to scoop your mids, then you have to accept the fact that you're not gonna have bass because the low end just cuts in so much. And then you have to start EQing the bass drum if you really want to hear it and that's how you end up with clicky double kicks.
p874
aVwhat /u/metalq said is the best option. get your tone so that even if you're using a shitty one dollar logitech rock band USB microphone it sounds good, and all you'll really need to do is EQ / compression to get rid of too much low end (which'll obscure drums &amp; bass) and the 5-6khz mark which is where the hoover-like hiss comes from with distortion
p875
aVWhat kind of compression?
p876
aVI use a low pass filter on my guitars to completely cut off any frequencies above 7.5khz, because with my tone that's where 90% of the hiss/static comes from, also I like to keep that freq range free for other instruments 
p877
aVGuitars hard RL. Good playing and a good amp means a good tone.\u000a\u000aHere's a track with guitars just RL, EQ HP at 100 and LP at 7.5k. https://soundcloud.com/recordingmf/b-vera
p878
aVIs this a proper recording of a proper amp with proper drums?
p879
aVNo. SSD4 and amp sims. That's how most metal is produced nowadays.
p880
aVWhat's your guitar chain like? Have you got anything that's just one guitar by itself? I want to compare it to my guitar because I'm concerned my pickups suck dick and I'll forever be stuck with a terrible tone.\u000a\u000aIs SSD4 way better than addictive drums? How much post are you doing? This whole thing sounds great, I wanna be able to make mixes that sound that good at home.
p881
aVMy guitar is going through a parallel amp configuration of an Ignite Emissary and a Lepou LeCto then going through parallel God's Cab impulses sm57 1inch cap and sm57 grill edge. The same setup is done for the other guitar and both are panned 100L and 100R. Then both go through a bus which has an eq looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/wkWOtg7.jpg) and that's it. If your tone doesn't sound good, then it's the rest of the mix. This is the thing most people don't get. I've personally never mixed with addictive drums (except once I think) but from the demos I've heard you should be able to get a decent mix from it. For mixing drums, the advice I can give is don't overdo it. Most drum tracks should only have an EQ and compressor on them, although, a very important tool you should use is a gate. This helps clear your drums up a whole lot and I would suggest to use it just below the point where it sounds weird.
p882
aVWhat is a parallel amo configuration, what is Ignite Emissary? I'm familiar with God's Cab impulses, will have to give them a shout, thanks.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think about quad guitars? And when I'm mixing a song that has two harmony rhythm parts, should I record each thing twice? Four times? 
p883
aVParallel amp configuration means the guitar is going through two amps simultaneously. I had to use [metaplugin](http://www.ddmf.eu/product.php?id=3) in order to set this up properly. This is [Ignite Emissary](http://www.kvraudio.com/product/emissary-by-ignite-amps). Quad tracking depends on what you are doing. If it's fast stuff then double tracking is all you need, but if it's slow like downtempo, quad tracking is preferred. Usually with differing rhythm parts you should still do hard left and hard right, but still it just depends. If you're doing lead and rhythm, rhythm is double tracked, and lead goes in the center. Sometimes even lead is double tracked and put 30L and 30R or something just to fill in space. You just have to hear what you're doing and make a decision. I guess the rule you can make is, the lower it is, the more tracks that is required.
p884
aVI also want to say that mixing the bass and kick correctly are absolutely essential in getting a good guitar tone
p885
aVIs there a way to "hear" for that?
p886
aVThat's the tough part. I posted this a while ago about mixing bass.\u000a\u000a&gt;The bass is tricky. If you're recording, set up two tracks and track both bass tracks simultaneously through a DI box. Low pass the first bass track below 133hz and then hi pass all the bass out of the second track and make it sound like a guitar. Bam now you have control of the low end and you can blend the bass tone with the guitar tone. Live bass is a bit different. You can use an EQ to control the low end with various levels of success. It wont be as awesome as having split channels but most the time you can't hear anything in a live show because shitty engineers so don't worry too much just make the bass as huge as possible (try cutting 230hz and boosting 58hz or 100hz).\u000a\u000aFor mixing kick, my advice would be taking out all the useless harmonics (200-1000hz etc.) and it will punch. 
p887
aVDo you tweak the EQ between your guitar tracks to give them each a bit of room? I single track my riffs but if I ever throw on a second layer, I usually boost it around 2000 Hz, while my main rhythm is boosted at 1000 Hz.
p888
aVI have experimented with that but it's usually not necessary. If I need the extra edge I'll do it.
p889
aVI would get a tone that I dug the sound of playing on its own, a sound that inspired me to want to rock out. It typically had way too much bottom end to work well with a bass track and drums, so I would eq out maybe the bottom 25-30% of the recorded guitar track. I'd also do that for the bass guitar track, but only the bottom 15-20% or so of it. The guitar needs to leave room for the bass, and they both need to leave room for the drums. It's important to remember that the best guitar and bass tones on their own aren't always what works well in a recorded mix with other instruments.\u000a\u000aThen I'd pan one guitar track hard left, another hard right. I'm not a fan of lots of layered guitar tracks, I think they "smooth" the guitar tone out too much. I think the guitar tone is more aggressive with just two tracks, or more raw vs. polished.
p890
aVIf you start with a harsh tone it will smooth out to be about the and though. I just leave any presence and treble controls further up than I would if I wasn't recording. I don't see how it's any different from cutting gain down and not cutting the kids as much.\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: Cutting mids not kids...well unless they deserve it.
p891
aVI try to remember to carve out some space for bass.
p892
aV[deleted]
p893
aVI treat my project like a live jazz band so I single track my rhythm guitar and then pan it with the bass soft R/L respectively (20%). Single tracked guitars really only sound "weak" when you scoop your mids, I do a mid boost and put just enough reverb to space it out a bit.\u000a\u000aI volume level my tracks according to the drums - just loud enough to still heard double kicks, and I keep the bass audible so the guitars can get lost when vocals kick in. However, there are better ways to present your guitars besides just making them louder than everything else, namely through composition.

Vocal Exercises &amp; proper warm ups 10x more than practicing along with a track.  work your lows until they are AWESOME before working on your vocal fry technique.  really be able to control your pitch thru muscle control first, this will let you know youre ready to work on the part that can REALLY FUCK YOUR VOCALS IF U DO IT WRONG.  As opposed to singing, where I feel compression on my diaphragm from the top, with heavy vocals, i feel the compression from the bottom of my diaphram.  "HISSSSSS" &amp; really clench your PC muscle FUCKIN HARD(yeah, the one that controls your dick). thats the region where we will be producing our power.  the rest is refining technique.  WARMUP WARMUP WARMUP -  PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE - AND MOST IMPORTANT - REST!

p935
aVThe best advice I have for you is to warm up properly, practice daily, drink plenty of water, and try to avoid performing vocals in a dry enviornment. Daily practice will get you the consistency you desire.\u000a Melissa Cross is a great source for. learning the basic technique, past that it is up to you to discover how to generate the tone you want. For a Corpsegrinder type of vocal it's all about breath power and diaphragm strength. 
p936
aVLook on YouTube for singing videos by Robert Luciani. He has some really solid advice. Also look up Vocal Fry. Avoid the Zen of Screaming. It is total wank.
p937
aVThe Zen of Screaming is *not* total wank, it just doesn't teach screaming, it teaches things like breath control and tongue placement. It helped me a lot when I was learning.\u000a\u000aI hear volume two does teach it, but I've only seen volume one.
p938
aVIt felt like total wank when I was watching it. The second DVD is better, but it is no way a great DVD to learn from. It constantly felt like an advertisement for Melissa's school rather than a teaching guide. I wouldn't ever recommend it, especially when you can find more efficient, succinct teaching online. The first DVD is all stuff you can find from any singing resource. \u000a\u000aI'm not going to sit here and argue it more, but it's really not the first thing I'd ever recommend when it comes to learning any kind of harsh vocals.

p980
(lp981
VOne of my favorite P86 tracks. \u000a\u000aMix wise the vocals are too loud. I personally feel like the drums could use some variation as well. Overall, pretty cool to hear a different take. 
p982
aVThanks for answering!  Listening to it again, I can agree that the vocals are a little hot throughout the song.  Something that I'll definitely put more work into for future projects.
p983
aVGreat song to cover. One thing is that Andrew's vocal style is very percussive, so any time you don't hit the exact cadence as the original track it comes out a bit sloppy. I actually thought the more metal drumming was pretty clever, could take that concept further with this track. Good stuff!
p984
aVWhen my brother and I decided to cover Spy Hunter, our biggest concern was that Andrew's voice is really unique and hard to cover and I definitely had issues hitting all his parts correctly.  Especially the Chorus and the end of Verse 2 come to mind.\u000a\u000aThanks for enjoying the drums though, it's the first track I put together on this program and I'm glad it sounded ok.

aV[Church of Misery - Badlands](http://youtu.be/rWEKhqHi3dk?t=4m20s)\u000a\u000aRight after the solo there's this stupidly sweet riff which uses the minor 7th, maj 6th, and min 3rd, so it essentially falls under dorian. Missing the maj 2nd though. But still so sweeeet. The chorus comes back in which is just minor pentatonic (blues scale if you want to include the bend up from a four to a flat five). Then it fades out to the same riff from earlier. I would recommend listening to the whole song though because it's a killer song. Also learn it because it's fun to play.

p1003

VLots of harmonies in 2nds. Very Ligeti [2001: Space Odyssey]\u000a\u000aChords with 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths. Keep the root out of the guitar and let the bass handle it to give your fingers more room.
p1005
aVCool, Thanks.
p1006
aVFor chord shapes, [here's a cool tutorial](http://youtu.be/BL_-0geICso?t=2m5s) on big spacey chord voicings in drop tuning from The Faceless's Michael Keene. I found it really useful as it makes big chords a lot easier to grab.
p1007
aVYou can't go wrong with the diminished scale. Also, coming up with chromatic patterns and tapping them is classic. You can then pick a pattern and ascend/descend one string at a time, or perhaps diagonally. That's the sort of thing Buckethead does. Rings of Saturn also used it a lot on their second album.
p1008
aVI did a little research and found some other interesting ideas.  I'm adding them here for my own record keeping.\u000a\u000aUse major, minor, and lydian scales (augmented IV).\u000aUse tritones.\u000aUse diminshed VI relationships and chords.
p1009
aVLydian is your friend. Jumping from the I to the #IV elicits a pretty spacey vibe. 
p1010
aVSometimes, less is more! Personally, I find a simple octave (like fret 5 on your A, fret 7 on your G, while muting the D string) creates a great spacey sound. If you've got a chorus pedal, even better!

aVCommenting here so I can remember this jam...good stuff guys, thanks for the tips.
p1015
aVDoing the same
p1016
asVWhat are some good ways to spice up my song writing?
p1017
(lp1018
VThink of neat licks and riffs to squeeze into the bridges between choruses and the verses. A lot of the *spice* in a song comes from those few seconds of transition, and not the actual chorus. It's the buildup, the climb, that everyone loves.  Think of the bridge as a ladder instead of a bridge, and think of the chorus as a diving board. Climb, jump, and make a huge splash. 
p1019
aVVariation. Have something repeating 4 times? Do it thrice with a turn-around or twice with a variation then a turn. Our perhaps your turn is repeated twice the second time should be slightly different. Add a simple line with each repeat of the chorus making it larger every time. \u000a\u000aDon't just throw lick after lick into the song. Less music is more. Reduce, reuse, recycle. Listen to Beethoven's 5th. He only wrote those first 4 notes before milking them for everything they're worth. How? Variation.
p1020
aVthrow in a saxophone solo.   I also agree with the idea of variation.  Take your riff and see what else you can make of it. I know that when I write a song, I can usually make a couple more out of the same riff just by changing the key or timing or adding a few other notes.  And with repetition,  doing things in even/odd patterns can denote certain "feelings."  repeating things an even number denotes a sort of resolution, where odd numbers denote instability.  
p1021
aV&gt; throw in a saxophone solo.\u000a\u000a[It works!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cN91vPDLq0)

aVyeah I love Ihsahn.  There was another band I heard, a little more deathy that had one too.  Can't think of it, but I hear it on SiriusXM all the time.   I even used to play the sax in school but never really thought to put it in metal,  maybe a baritone sax, but nothing smaller.

p1025

p1026
aVI'll check them out on spotify.
p1027
aVIf you can play/have access to other instruments this can be helpful. \u000a\u000aI'm not the best pianist but I've written some pretty cool, interesting riffs that I would never have thought to play on guitar. Then transcribe it over. 
p1028
aVWhen I get in a rut I write stuff attempting to emulate the style of someone I like that doesn't sound much like me. It usually ends up sounding halfway in between my style and theirs but gives me a sense of arranging things in a different way than my typical fashion.
p1029
aVLearn something new about music. I just learned about a new crazy slash chord and the song I'm working on is based on that and sounds nothing like my previous stuff.
p1030
aVThis is strictly my opinion, but any time I'm feeling predictable/boring, just change anything. I know how broad that sounds, but just take exactly what you're doing at a given... and change it in *any* way you can. I never have any idea of an end "goal", I just jam, change, see what's cool or not.\u000a\u000aVery simple example: You've got a big chord part with general strumming shit. Sounds boring, lame. Take same chord, start tremolo picking the notes individually. Bam, change, whether it's good or bad, just keep doing this and jamming. Nine times out of ten I eventually get to something semi-usable in a song.
p1031
aVDon't think songs have to have a certain structure. Seeing as a basic track will go verse, chorus, verse, chorus, middle 8, chorus, mess that up as much as possible. Adding things like pre choruses, different verses, etc can help. Maybe lay out a song in dynamics, so rather than verse, chorus, verse, etc.. Think like I want it to start quiet, then be loud, then quiet, then louder than before.. That way you can keep a structure, but without the limits of a certain style of section. There's many thing you can, that's just a few..
p1032
aVLearn some exotic scales maybe?  Marty Friedman used a sprinkling Japanese progressions for example, and Megadeth's *Holy Wars* has the Middle Eastern inspired acoustic bit in the middle, so constant research and practice can be handy in this respect.  \u000a\u000a  Time signatures are handy musical friend.  A lot of people play in basic 4/4 time which can sometimes come off as predictable.  Bands like Meshuggah do a lot of stuff with odd time signatures and polyrhythmic combinations (maybe a 4/4 drums with a 6/12 guitar track or something) and switching from one time signature to another can add some variety.  The same can be said of tempo.  Thrash uses that to good effect, especially if the tempo change is sudden and violent, it can brake someone ability to predict what's happening in the song.

p1045
(lp1046
VMy song writing world opened up when I started working on my vocals and playing drums. Once I started understanding and creating more than just guitar parts I could get a more complete song playing in my head before I even picked up an instrument or microphone. even if it's just a kick ass chorus riff and some babbling vocals over the top of it, I use that and built from it until I have a complete song.
p1047
aVWhat he said.
p1048
aVI picked up the drums almost 2 years ago, so not quite good enough to keep my vocals going simultaneously, but the things going thru my head are insane compared to what I used to write with my guitar. This dude nailed it. One? For ya, do you end up writing lyrics that follow your foot patterns? I'm having a hard time breaking this habit for the sake of variety.
p1049
aVWhen I was doing a lot of home recording I would deconstruct songs I like; figure out what the changes are, which riff the solo is over, bridge, etc. Some are amazingly complex, and some are amazingly simple.\u000a\u000aThen I'd try to write and record a song in the style of a band I liked. "I want this one to sound like Deftones, LoG," etc. 
p1050

p1051
aVsometimes I feel like the best way to start writing a song is to try and rewrite songs I like by my favourite bands.  I'll start playing a riff, then go with it where I feel the song should go, and then eventually its a whole new song, but the influence can still be heard.
p1052
aV&gt; rewrite songs I like by my favourite bands.\u000a\u000aIf you're trying to practice writing lyrics, an even better thing is to translate lyrics from another language.
p1053
aVComing from my background in black metal guitar, I find that just picking a random chord and fucking around with its pieces is fun and can provide easy transitions. Also, sus2 chords are fun
p1054
aVI did 7 years of music education but before that I played Metal, so I had the self-taught mind. \u000a\u000aI'm 39 and not in bands anymore, but I am writing a riff a week, put the phone or ipad on video, record what i'm playing and then listen. Try it! \u000a\u000aAnd yes, education is like a tennis net: friend or foe. 
p1055
aVSongwriting is a whole 'nother discipline compared to music theory, and is more bound to creativity than dilligent discipline and theory.\u000a\u000aBut try to mimic your idols writing. What would James Hetfield write? What would Eklundh write? What would Misha Mansoor write? \u000a\u000aBut just jam around on your guitar, and come up with a riff. Does it sound like a theme? A main riff? A chorus? Then just take it from there!
p1056
aVIdk about some of the advice here... I guess different stuff works for different people, but this is what I would recommend.  Start by just trying to write a bunch of riffs - it's ok if they're not even good riffs, because the point here is to just get used to the process of writing original stuff.  Just sit down for a while and play around with different notes/chords on your guitar until you come up with something that you at least kinda like.  It could be something super simple, and again, it doesn't have to be good at this point.  Then write it down.  I have a huge guitar pro file called "riffs" that's just tons and tons of rough ideas I've written out, each separated by a few bars of space.  I like guitar pro because I can scroll through and actually listen to all my ideas, but if you don't like using it or you think it takes to long to write stuff out, you can try recording rough takes of your riffs into a simple audio editor (like Audacity) or writing them down on paper.  Just anything that will help you remember and catalog the stuff you've written.  I personally like to try to come up with multiple ideas in the same session, since my brain kind of "warms up" and ends up producing better ideas as I go on.  \u000a\u000aAs you do this more and more, I guarantee you'll start getting the hang of it and end up writing some cool stuff that you like.  Once you have a bunch of ideas, you can start trying to put together a whole song by either trying to connect multiple riffs that you have already, or building off of one that you like and trying to figure out "what would come next".  Once you've got a whole song written on guitar you're pretty much set!  Writing drum/bass/whatever parts to go with it is a whole process in itself, but writing the creative core of the song (in your case the guitars) is the most important part.
p1057
aVI read an interview with Jeff Loomis about his creative process, and it's a lot like this.  He comes up with and records 10 riffs a day every day.  It doesn't matter if half of them are shit, as long as he hits the 10 riff mark.  Then once he has a stockpile, he starts sifting through them and putting them together as a framework and goes from there.
p1058
aVTo add to this, if you're really stuck, finding a random drum beat online and then jamming to it can be helpful.
p1059
aVIf you're like me then it might be easier if you find someone else to bounce ideas off of - especially someone who is better at the foundational aspects of writing - I find that if I have a solid base I can build and elaborate upon that. Getting that base is hard, I want to do everything at once so anything I make seems like it could be something else. With someone elses base you don't have as many of those pesky human psychological urges to change it.\u000a\u000aThat being said "just find a partner with very specific counter qualities!" isn't easy to do - maybe just something you can think about. I know I like to do everything myself but sometimes I have to admit that I can't do it all and I need help (eww! jk).
p1060
aVI'm working on something huge that's along the lines\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLufiw_AG5FNENinhQ9Y7tTqmc7G9OP8AH\u000a\u000aI'm basically talking about my approach to songwriting which is a bit more detailed than empty "Play what feels right" advice. I do everything for a solo project, if you're just looking at guitar, there's a lot less to dig through. But I hope this stuff helps. There's more along the way, I have some stuff coming up on writing leads and solos, followed by lyrics and then finally recording and production as well.
p1061
aVVery cool! I plan on watching these when I get home tonight. Thank you for sharing
p1062
aVI never know if I'm making any sense cause I get into some abstract ideas occasionally, but I hope some of the ideas are clear. The videos on guitar should make more sense since that's my background. Feedback is always nice.
p1063
aVSomething I've found helps me when I hit writer's block and need inspiration is watching bands I like make music. I'll watch docs like Making Magnetic, Crack The Skye: Track By Track, The Making Of The Blackening, etc, and usually it makes me feel like writing. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Obviously creativity can't be forced, but it can be nudged.
p1064
aVYou may be trying to incorporate too much education into the process. Rock out a 3 chord punk thing just to get the juices flowing. Make up 1 line of gibberish lyrics to get the feel of it and BAM shift it into another riff n see if it doesn't help you transition into another naturally flowing section of music just naturally; sometimes it's seamless, like it's a fucking song you already knew. I learned this from Strangers With Candy; 'sometimes when I want to make something original, the first thing I do is get out my tracing paper.' Really, Fuck it, I'm not making money off this song, n it's not direct plagiarism, I ain't hurting nobody, I'm stealing this riff just for fun... Nothing wrong with that either, unless it's done too often or if pros do it
p1065
aVOr, write 4 riffs, (or a friend write them, catchy stuff, riffy stuff) then write 3 strange, mathematically sound/technical transitions (which should be your forte) for the in betweens. It's kind of hard to make a cookie cutter for metal song writing, so make your own n fill in the blanks.  
p1066
asVSo where would I start learning how to write metal?
p1067
(lp1068
VMy personal songwriting journey went from: 1) learning the basics of the guitar, to 2) playing a lot of covers and building a 'metal library' in my head, to 3) creating riffs by messing around and drawing from my metal library, to 4) being able to write specific things that fit within a premeditated vision. \u000a\u000a\u000aWhen I hear people talk about songwriting (and in metal, it's usually really *riff* writing), they'll often suggest looking into music theory. To me, theory becomes more helpful later in one's journey when you begin to be restricted by what you can do; I don't think it's important at the beginning stages.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe only thing I can say is **keep writing**. Songwriting is something you *do* rather than something you learn. You can learn to play other people's songs, but you can't really learn from others about how to tap into your own creative process. It really is trial and error.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe most practical advice I can give you is: first, analyze what works in songs you like (pay attention to how the instruments are interacting with each other; what changes are there in tempo/feel throughout the song; is the song in the same key the whole time? etc...). Second, listen to a bunch of music you like from which you'll draw inspiration. Don't *learn* these songs but try to mimic something about them; that is, think about what you want to play and translate that into your fingers. Finally, just go with what feels natural to you and be patient. For the longest time I could only seemingly write decent clean guitar parts, and then for a while after that I suddenly could crank out heavy riffs but no clean ones. \u000a\u000a\u000aYour ability to create will come and go, so just keep working on it and be prepared to capture the good moments when they arise. Good luck!

aVWhat's your experience with learning your instruments?  All self-taught, have you had lessons?  Never be afraid of seeking lessons, because the more knowledge of music you have, the more tricks you have to pull out of the bag.  Learning my guitar scales for example made me see the patterns of notes and it opened the fretboard right up for me.  I could finally see and could identify what key my favourite metal solos were in (or at least most likely in), and knowing this you'll get a better idea of what notes will sound good together.\u000a\u000a  Teachers can give you ideas you'd never have thought of yourself and can also correct mistakes in your technique you didn't know you were making.  If you go researching you'll find that there are plenty of big name acts who's members have gone and got lessons, if not regularly, than at least time to time eg. Kerry King of Slayer.

aVAs far as getting melodies and retaining them, I find the best way to do it is record yourself humming or singing the melody on your phone or anything with a sound recorder, and attempting to transcribe it at a later date. The app Evernote is a godsend for me as it syncs across your phone, computer, tablet, whatever it's installed on. 
p1072
aVHow much do you know about chord construction and harmonies? That's pretty much essential in putting together any sort of black metal since the genre is driven by harmonies.
p1073
aVyou say you'd like to make an 'ambient black metal' project. thing about that genre, is that it's much more based in orchestral music than rock and roll. djent is a very different style of music, as it's more than anything based on rhythmic complexities. \u000a\u000aatmospheric black metal is often about tonality and contrapuntal motion. these concepts aren't things most people just jump into. one of my favorite bands, krallice, do this stuff really well. listen to [this track](http://youtu.be/CVGrJUDNM9s) and try to notice how the two guitars and bass are all playing similar melodic lines, but they are tonically complimentary. mick barr and colin marsten are classically trained musicians and write based on these fairly complex theories. [which is why i love them so much.]\u000a\u000aso, this music is less about 'riffs' and more about understanding what kind of dissonance and resonance you want to achieve with all the parts. now, you don't necessarily have to learn music theory to do these things. if you listen to enough music, you can train yourself to understand these concepts instinctually. i think most technical metal bands are these sort of 'instinctual' players. so the truth is, if you can't do it where you are now, you should either start learning music theory or listen to a lot of really complex compositions and try to glean what you can out of them. maybe do both. listen to a lot of bach and froberger. in the end, write what feels good. not everyone can write complex music, but everyone can try. and who knows, maybe you'll come up with something crazy unique and awesome. :)

VI like to use a cab simulator with real tube distortion. \u000a\u000aI feel the digital distortion has not yet been able to model more complex and crunchy chords when compared to tubes. Specifically I use tube distortion pedals for a couple reasons. One, they generally have only one tube. This makes it very easy and cheap to swap tubes when one gets old or I want a different tone. Secondly, I like to use effects before and after my distortion. With a classic amp head I would have to run a cable from my pedalboard to the head and then back to the board and then back to the head again. Thats way too much cable. \u000a\u000aFor my cab sim I use a Torpedo Live. This gives me quite a bit of choices. It have something like 50 cabs, 8 mics, and 8 power amp simulations all for the price of one. I can also get the tone I want and not have to worry about the sound guy not micing my cab in a way that I like. If I ever decided to use a head, this would also function as a load box. I built a real "cab" with some PA speakers so that, with a power amp, I can practice and rehearse through this. I also use it as a monitor for myself in live situations. \u000a\u000aThis part of my set up (cab sim, distortion, power amp, and PA speakers) probably costed me about $2000. It works great for me. I hope this helps point you in the right direction for you. \u000a\u000a
p1081
aVThanks for your response!! This is useful and the kind of response I'm looking for. A couple questions if I may:\u000a\u000a* 1) What is the point of power amp simulation on the Torpedo Live? If I understand correctly, it mimics some power amps but cannot act as a power amp itself? \u000a* 2) Can you recommend mixer - power amp combos?. Could two guitarists go through the same power amp and PA system (perhaps panned)?\u000a* 3) Does your setup look something like guitar -&gt; pedalboard (including tube distortion) -&gt; Torpedo Live/cab sim -&gt; power amp -&gt; PA speakers?\u000a* 4) What is a load box? I tried to google, but I am still confused on when you might need to use it.
p1082
aV1) Different power tubes give a slightly different sound. for example 6L6 power tubes sound very deep while EL34 power tubes sound a lot thinner. \u000a\u000a2) For rehearsals I dont use a PA. I took an old Rogue (I believe that is the Musician's Friend brand) combo amp, took the pre-amp and speakers out, and put in some loudspeakers (PA speakers). It is now basically a guitar cabinet with loudspeakers. I have a power amp in my rack that powers it. Mine has two 50 watt channels (It's a Rocktron velocity 100) so I could run two guitars through it. Some have one channel. Another option I considered was getting a powered PA speaker but I like having a guitar cab so I didn't go that route. In that case you could just go; Cab sim &gt; DI &gt; PA\u000a\u000a3) My signal chain get a little odd in the middle but I'll do my best to explain it. Keep in mind this is for live gigs.\u000a\u000aGuitar &gt; Pedalboard &gt; a couple other rack units &gt; Torpedo Live &gt;&gt; Here I split my signal into two with a male 1/4" to 2 female 1/4" cord\u000a\u000a\u000a^1 DI box &gt; Front of house \u000a\u000a^2 Power amp &gt; My guitar cab (this cab is not miked and is mostly used as a monitor for my self)\u000a\u000aWhen I am rehearsing I just go with the second split.\u000a\u000a4) A load box takes an amplified signal and brings it down to a line level signal (or a mic level I'm not sure which one). Since the Torpedo live is a load box this means you can send your signal through an amp head then to the Torpedo. If it was not a load box then you would have to come out of the effects send of the amp head, bypassing the power amp in the head, or you would run the risk of frying the Torpedo. This is good if you have an amp head or a power amp and want to have the sound of the power tubes. I believe a power attenuator is the same thing.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

(lp1101
VIt's cool but feels more like an ambient/EDM track that happens to have some guitar in it than a metal song. Nothing really catchy in there for me, but good production.
p1102
aVI dig it, the crash cymbals are a bit to "splashy" for me if that makes any sense, but I dig what you are doing
p1103
aVI think it has potential. Like others have said though, it needs a hook or some sort of composition shift to maintain interest. Had a great intro, but definitely "plateaued" in interest. It's missing a defining "lead" element throughout. You've got the rhythm section down as well as your spacey synths for atmosphere, but no particular melody or sound to keep the song moving. Reminds me a little bit of some atmospheric metal bands out there like Atoma. Recommended for inspiration/ideas.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M_8asTJOH0
p1104
aVWell, you sir, do not understand the music that I write. As well a person, who told that I need a guitar. Let me explain it once and for all.\u000a\u000aThe guitar or hook or any instrument *in focus* would make background instruments less noticable. And I *wanted* them to be noticed, because there are a melody line which I wrote intentionally and which I want listeners to notice. Background and rhythm instruments make this song. There are no solo part of the song, because its not a style that I chase. \u000a\u000aAlso thanks for Atoma, its amazing. I've been looking for interesting metal for a damn long time. The snare is so damn addictive.\u000a\u000aIm definitely going to write a hit song with a sexy hook, but not right now. Im looking for inspiration atm. And tbh, I think this song has a lot of hooky parts. At least I write a song the way I want it to hear for at least 100 times. And I can't say that there are something in this song I don't like as a music listener. 
p1105
aVI think you mistook what I meant by "hook". A hook can be anything that grabs your attention. Didn't mean it in like, a pop song chorus hook, or even a solo. Neither of those things sound like they would fit in the context of this song. But it still feels like it's missing... something. It doesn't feel "full" to me. It peaks compositionally after about a minute with little variation afterwards.\u000a\u000aI listen to a lot of atmospheric/repetitive music, but there's always something that grabs my attention when I do listen to it. Whether it's the production style, the riff that's repeating, or a sudden shift in movement or sound, etc. You've got a good baseline/theme to work from, but it doesn't feel complete to me.\u000a\u000aEntirely subjective opinion, and you asked for "any feedback". That's just my 2 cents.
p1106
aVI love how if something gets posted, people discuss just fine, but when I posted my song, someone directed me to a different subreddit; even though it's "metal."\u000a
p1107
aVMetalcore isn't considered metal by most "traditional" metalheads. I think your song's pretty good though, even though I'm not into the genre that much.
p1108
aVI've heard "traditional" metalheads refer to "metal musicians" as people such as Ozzy, Judas Priest, Black Label, etc. \u000a\u000aFucking genres confuse me. But thanks.
p1109
aVPriest and Sabbath are plain Heavy Metal (which is sometimes also called traditional heavy metal. I think this guy didn't mean it like that though, he just meant *traditionally* metal). Metalcore is often seen as non-metal because of the loads of commercialized shit that came out years ago like A7X and Killswitch Engage that all the mainstream teenrock stations labeled as "metal".

aVI like the way you describe the approach on the cymbals- seems like a good way to think about it. I will narrow the panning some, I believe the panning is set to the stock EZD pan settings right now. \u000a\u000aBass was done with two tracks, one clean and one distorted. I've been struggling with the distorted track and I think you nailed it on the head- it takes up a lot of the guitars space. If I remember right, there is a lot of 1-2k where the pick attack is strong. I used a multipressor to smooth the picking out a bit while trying to keep the rest of the highs somewhat dynamic. The clean low signal is compressed pretty hard. \u000a\u000aAround what frequencies should the distorted part be sitting to cut through/around the guitar? I've been trying to get it to slide in underneath the highs of the guitars, but that may not be the best way
p1115
aV[deleted]

aVSounds ok. The cymbals get fatiguing after a while and the mix seems strangely centred but no real complaints otherwise.
p1117
aVNoted. Thanks for the input. These headphones have a much stronger treble response than I'm used to, so I couldn't tell if the cymbals were kinda loud or if I was just hearing what they actually sound like haha.\u000a\u000aNot sure what to do about the centeredness other than maybe play different parts on the left/right tracks though. 
p1118
aVDo you have 2 separate rhythm takes? How are they panned?
p1119
aVThere are is a pair of rhythm takes panned hard L/R and a pair of lead/ambient takes also panned hard L/R. 
p1120
aVDid you encode it as a joint stereo MP3 prior to uploading, perhaps? There's something seriously wrong with the stereo image as far as I can hear. To me, the rhythm is coming from somewhere in the middle, and it seems to change with each note.
p1121
aVIt sounds like you compressed your overheads- don't do that. It's making the cymbals do weird things. They should also be panned differently, because that aspect of it is kind of weird right now. \u000a\u000aEither give the guitars more treble, raise the low-pass filter, or both. \u000a\u000aOn the bass, the distortion sounds good but is a little too click-clacky. Load up an instance of an EQ profiler (Ozone, ProQ, etc.) and take a sample of the guitar spectrum to see where there's room for the distorted bass track to breathe, then give it a nice bell boost around there. \u000a\u000aThe kick is also buried by the bass, so make sure you've carved out an EQ notch in the bass so the kick can be heard, and if the whole song is similar to this tempo, I would sidechain-compress the bass to the kick.\u000a\u000aMost important: Don't pan your rhythm and leads the same. Pan your rhythm hard L/R but do the leads anywhere from 60-85% or so. It will fill out the stereo spectrum and let everything breathe more easily.\u000a\u000aSounds really good all things considered though :)

VD'addario exclusively.\u000a\u000aAs far as gauges, it depends on which tuning I'm using. Right now I'm using custom sets (from http://www.guitarstringsonline.com):\u000a\u000a25.5" Telecaster, D Standard: 10.5 14 19w 30 42 59   \u000a25.5" LTD H1001, E Standard: 9.5 12 17w 26 36 52  \u000a\u000aI think I'm going to just start buying stock sets from now on, though, lately I've been finding I've been focusing way too hard on the niggling technical details and not enough on actually playing. I'll probably use [these](http://www.daddario.com/DADProductDetail.Page?ActiveID=3769&amp;productid=25&amp;productname=EXL116_Nickel_Wound__Medium_Top_Heavy_Bottom__11_52) for D and [these](http://www.daddario.com/DADProductDetail.Page?ActiveID=3769&amp;productid=7&amp;productname=EXL125_Nickel_Wound__Super_Light_Top__Regular_Bottom__9_46) for E.\u000a\u000aI did however get a set of Rotosound Yellows for a stocking stuffer and I do really like how they feel so I might give them a shot.

I also am using a 6505+ as well.\u000a\u000aI have 4 main guitars in 4 different tunings, but what I'm after in all of them is the same tension and feel that a set of regular light 10s has in standard tuning.\u000a\u000aGibson LP Studio, 24.75" scale, E standard tuning: .010, .013, .018w, .026, .036, .046 (D'Addario EXL110W set)\u000a\u000aDean VX, 24.75" scale, D standard tuning: .011, .014, .021w, .028, .038, .049 (D'Addario EXL115W set)\u000a\u000aDean ML '79, 24.75" scale, B standard tuning: .013, .017, .026w, .036, .046, .056 (D'Addario EJ22 set)\u000a\u000aLTD MH-250NT, 25.5" scale, F# standard tuning: .016, .020, .030w, .044, .056, .072 (Ernie Ball 2839 set with .016 and .020 swapped in for .013 and .018)\u000a\u000aI also have an acoustic strung up as a baritone (25.5" scale), B standard tuning: .016, .022, .029w, .048, .060, .070 (D'Addario EXP23 set) and it sounds mean as fuck.

aVErnie Ball Skinny Top Heavy Bottom strings.
p1136
aVSame. I used to use D'addario, but I didn't like the brand new, stuff, bright sound it had. Whereas Ernie Ball strings already feel kinda of stretched and ready to play (but not so much that the strings are dead). Not sure if it's makes sense.
p1137
aVNever played flat wounds. Sounds like something I might like.
p1138
aVI recently started using flat wounds and it makes playing so much more comfortable. I do a lot of slides and there is no more squeaks, and it just feels nicer on my fingers. The tone is a little warmer than the traditional style of strings but I find the difference barely noticeable.

aVD'addario. I tried a few different kinds early on, but playing in a thrash band takes its toll quick on strings. I've never had one fail that wasn't a direct result of a shitty bridge. Most of the cheaper metal stop rails (and Chinese saddle parts for the Floyd) would create ruts that eventually cut the strings. Once I figure that out, I knew that I was working with prime strings after a set of elixers broke during the second practice. 
p1151
aVI use Dunlop. They last a long time and I really like the sound of them. They feel nice playing them too. I use a standard 10 gauge on my Jackson Dinky and soon I'll be doing the same with my LTD EC-1000 deluxe which I currently have 13's with a heavy bottom end. I think they're 13's I can't remember.

I tried a number of different strings when I started playing, and like these the best. The reason is clarity. I feel like they deliver great tone from whatever bass I'm playing on any string, anywhere on the neck. They also stay in tune pretty well, and hold a great tone for several months.\u000a\u000aMy main axe is a Warwick six string thumb bass in standard tuning. The low B is nice and deep, and the high C is nice and clear. I get good note definition even with distortion.

VI really like the riffs. The transitions are great and the song composition seems well thought out.\u000a\u000aThe guitars sound a little cold to me at the beginning for some reason as the song progresses I don't notice it as much. Maybe the additional layering is adding warmth. I'm not sure. Regardless if you're happy with your tone, who am I to criticize. \u000a\u000aOne more thing at 0:25 when you transition to the main riff I think it should be much larger. The volume seems to decrease instead of explode after that buildup. \u000a\u000aGood job on the song man, followed - I wanna see where you go with this!\u000a\u000a
p1159
aVThanks man!\u000a\u000aI see what you mean at the 0:25 mark. That intro was also just something I came up with, since I thought the song starting bluntly was, well, blunt. Like being hit by a wet sock. Luckily, this is more to demonstrate song structure and writing. Also, I have to re-dial my soundcard every time I go from bass to guitar, and vise versa. And I do that a lot.\u000a\u000aI kind of like my guitars not too warm, since it gives it additional edge. I dislike sawblade distortion and heavy gain djent, so I tried to go with a more thrash-inspired tone, but still with a fair bit of mids, to let the guitar sit tightly in the mix. It's based on a patch I found that tried to emulate Adlers (LoG) tone, and tweaked with the help of Oceill drummer Joel Lindfors. But I have to mention, I haven't changed strings in several months, so my tone is not optimal for that reason. :D\u000a\u000aAnd thanks for following! I just got a date with my vocalist here in 2 weeks time, along with I just ordered a copy of Spectrasonics OmniSphere, so unless anything gaudy happens, I'll have a final, album quality version of "Incendiary Godsend" ready and posted here on reddit.
p1160
aVI like the intro and particularly the build up. I just think it should explode when the song gets going because of the anticipation the build creates.\u000a\u000aLike I said, if you're happy with the tone of your guitars ignore me. :)  I think vox in there with a final mix will smooth out any of the hard edges I'm hearing anyway. \u000a\u000aDefinitely looking forward to hearing your final product!

aVMusically this is pretty solid, has good flow, and keeps the listener interested. The production though could use some work. I feel like the drums need some work to properly fill out the sound. They are a little sparse in places, and some more elaborate drums could really add to the heaviness imo. You also mentioned having a lot of mids in the guitar, so that it fits well in the mix. That is a good approach, but when you don't have any bass guitar on the track, it leaves a hole in the sound. If you were to fix up the drums a bit and add some bass, this could be really heavy.
p1162
aVThanks for the feedback. :)\u000a\u000aI actually didn't get around tracking bass for the track, since I've only tracked for 1/3 of it, and didn't want 2/3 of the song to sound lackluster in comparison to the rest; rather have a faily consistent product. Drums are also not quite done in regards to composition.\u000a\u000aYou can though check out my newly uploaded song [right here](https://soundcloud.com/asrial/incendiary-godsend-final-synth), which includes how I do bass, drums and synths.

aVI have a Peavey 6505+. It can handle pretty much any kind of metal and you can get some epic tones out of it. I only paid £475 second hand for it, but it's like new.
p1167
aVBoth are sweet. Check out the Artisan series that come with V30 speakers. They will do any kind of music. The clean voicings can do a very good Fender or Vox type tone. The 60 watt combo has the presence and resonance controls. If you turn the ISF control all the way left, scoop the mids almost completely and turn up the resonance and presence it sounds like a Mesa. ISF to the right with the mids at noon, and presence and resonance to taste sounds like a modded Marshall. Super versatile amps that are built like tanks.   
p1168
aVI have the 2x12 HT-60 and I love it for its versatility. The OD channels sound great, except I have to use a decimator in the effects loop when switched to OD2 because of outrageous noise on that channel. Otherwise, nice crunch, almost brown sound. I've foregone external distortions in favor of the internal  because of its tightness. \u000a\u000aClean channel is great, only a bit heavy on the bass. When I use a hollow body, I need to use an EQ pedal and roll the bass on channel 1 all the way down. Otherwise, it's usually at about 9:30. \u000a\u000aDirect out is among the most natural I've heard. Useful for recording, but overdrive is heavier than when heard through the cabinet. \u000a\u000aI'm impressed with how consistent it sounds at lower volumes. Strangely, I can practice more quietly with this than with my Roland Cube 60. 
p1169
aVI've played on the HT-20 and I thought it was pretty stellar. Fairly dark sounding amp, but not overly dark. OD was pretty rich and thick sounding and the cleans were pretty sparkly, but not overly sparkly. Very balanced and versatile.

p1199
asVI've been working on my production quality a lot lately and this song is my first practical use of what I've been learning. Let me know what you think!
p1200
(lp1201
VI think it sounds pretty good, the composition is really good. Only thing I might change would be the guitar tone. It could use some fattening up, right now it feels sorta weak. It's all midrange. Everything else sounds good to me.
p1202
aVI am going to have to disagree. I find the distorted guitar tone to be fine (unless my speakers are adding a lot of bass or something), however, I found some sections of the song to be repeditive, the riffs themselves weren't bad they were just repeated a few too many times for my liking. I would also work on the drums as well, the beats were a little too sparse in places, making the song sound kinda empty at times. Overall though the mix is pretty good.
p1203
aVReally? I was pretty pleased with the drums for this one. That said, I've kinda always been very utilitarian about how I write them so they've always been a bit tough for me. What could I have done differently?
p1204
aVI just think they need more variety in places, take the first riff that comes in around 30 seconds, the drum beat is good it goes with the music and has some nice cymbal skips, but it uses the exact same beat the whole time the riff plays, no fills or variations. In my opinion when doing instrumental music you should strive to keep the listeners interest by having movement in some part of the music at all times, so while the guitar may play the same riff over and over the drums can elaborate on the initial beat with some fills and variations. This creates movement and direction which can build energy and allow for better transitions between sections. \u000a\u000aAnother side note with the drums is if you want them to sound more realistic you need to add some randomization to the velocity of the drums hits, it makes them sound more natural. To add realistic dynamics you make the drum hit on the down beat slightly harder than the offbeats, it helps to create a more natural pulse. The difference does not have to be much and you may NOT want to do this with the kickdrum, but it makes a big difference for fills and cymbal hits
p1205
aVGood stuff man, I'll keep that in mind when I'm working on drums in the future. Thanks!
p1206
aVThanks! Yeah the guitars are always a work in progress for me. Most of the saturated, mid-heavy sound comes from the two line-in tracks. This was my first time recording two guitar tracks with my amp as well, so once I nail the mic placement for that hopefully I can eliminate the line-in stuff and get that beefier, fuller sound to my guitar tracks.
p1207
aVYeah, aside from that tiny detail, there's some seriously awesome stuff on your soundcloud for sure! All the songs have a really great flow to them, which I definitely struggle with in my own writing. They all seem to be pretty dynamic.
p1208
aVI don't know how to put it..... but something feels like it's missing from this. It might be that you need more layers? I guess it just doesn't sound massive enough?\u000a\u000aBy all means it's a good track though, I guess it's missing a tiny oomph to me.

To quote the description for anyone short on time:\u000a\u000a&gt;For most styles of music, guitar tone serves an aesthetic role. You choose your tone based on what sounds good to you. But in black metal, tone plays an important functional role.\u000a\u000a&gt;Low frequencies have a side effect of muffling the harmonic contrast between the notes in a chord (10:22). This effect increases with playing speed, and thick, bassy tones are rarely ever found in black metal music for this reason.\u000a\u000a&gt;While high treble tone helps define the raw, black metal atmosphere, it also serves the functional purpose of increasing the harmonic contrast between the notes in a tremolo picked riff.\u000a
p1248
aVyou make good videos dude; engaging, and clear enough descriptions without too much over-simplification 
p1249
aVHey, thanks a lot man. My experience is that too many people focus on showing others how to do things instead of teaching, I think they're afraid of going too deep because they don't want to leave anyone out.\u000a\u000aI would prefer if people were more engaged, that way everyone gets something out of it. Even with my few "Riff Lessons" (I'm about to add a couple more), it's less about showing people how to play a song, which anyone can drill on their own, but more about demonstrating ideas which hopefully leads to learning and playing songs efficiently. Mostly importantly - train your ear so you don't have to rely on tabs. \u000a\u000aI'm going off on a tangent but when I get worked up on something it's hard to stop thinking about it. There's a video on that coming soon for sure.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I'm glad it's not too convoluted. This one was done over two days so it's long and I'm still worried it drags on because I repeat the same things over and over (of course there's a positive thing too). It's still a learning experience doing these, and I'm glad I get to improve on organizing my own thoughts in a presentable manner. 
p1250
aVno the repetition is good, it is a huge part of teaching/learning. even with some of the parts that many guitar players may already know--stuff like pick-up selection vs. guitar tone, which is something i have known for ever, it's a nice refresher...just hearing someone else reinforce what you already know, even if it's simple, helps some of the new information stick
p1251
aVHey man, these videos are great! I've hit a terrible block in connecting the music theory with my own writing and your videos have been helping clear it all up in a style that is extremely relevant to mine. Thanks so much! 
p1252

p1261
aVPretty Devin-y. nice. although I hate to simply compare, it's just what it reminded me of. 
p1262
aVIn terms of song writing and overall structure this is pretty sweet, I think the drums still need a little work in order to sound realistic though. During some of the softer parts the bass drum is pounding way too hard imo, and while it works with the heavier sections, it messes up the delicate atmosphere of the quiter parts. I would also try randomizing the velocity on the drum hits as well, as it can give them a less robotic feel. Overall though, good work. Drums are a pain in the ass to get right, and I feel like half the comments I see in these threads relate to the mixing of the drums, but you already have a good drum track musically, and that's the hardest part, so without too much work it should be sounding even better.  Excited to hear the rest of the album.

asVHow to Achieve That Bass Tone
p1264
(lp1265
VTo me, it sounds like it might be a fuzz on a low gain setting, I wouldn't be surprised if that sound came from a guitar pedal, rather than bass. Probably blended with a cleaner channel to keep the clarity and low end too.
p1266
aVNot sure what exactly is going on there, but here's how I'd do it.\u000a\u000aWhen recording bass, it's pretty common to record direct. I'd actually split the signal a few different ways, through multiple DI boxes or amps. The simplest way to do it would be to run a DI at the front of your chain, and record out of that. After that, I'd run whatever OD/fuzz I loved to get my dirty sound, run that into my amp (which is what I use for my tube overdrive) and then record that as well.\u000a\u000aNow I've got two different channels of two distinct bass sounds, which, when mixed together, give you that nasty dirt and the clean preciseness you hear in that clip.\u000a\u000a

aVJust one fuzz actually. The Demon is a Fulltone OCD clone (overdrive/distortion) with more gain options and a huge low end. I usually run the fuzz pedal with the overdrive on to get a less nasal fuzz tone. The Supercollider is muff based, so similar in tone to a bass big muff but with more clipping options, a bass filter, and blend.\u000a\u000aTogether they get a very sludgy sound, perfect for High On Fire / Electric Wizard-ish stuff.

asVHey everyone! I just posted a new cover onto YouTube. It's of The Zenith Passage's "Kaleidoscopic Tendencies". Care to watch? :D

VHell yeah dude, The Zenith Passage are one of my favorite up and coming bands.\u000a\u000aDid you learn this all by ear?
p1304
aVNot all of it. Some of it was already in the tab, but I guess it was by ear for the most part.
p1305
aVFffffuuuuuck yea! It is so hard for me to make the transition into those stretched out pretty(?) chords. Good work !

(lp1310
VI like the tune, and the guitar playing is top-notch.  I didn't hear much bass, though.  The drums sound great, too.  Are they programmed or played live?  Either way, a great job was done
p1311
aVThank you! I use a program called EZ drummer. My husband can play them live though, we are trying to figure out a good way to record him.\u000aYeah the bass is hard to put in the mix...I have very little experience with mixing.
p1312
aVEverything sounds spot on to me.  There could have been more bass though, something like a grittier low end.  \u000a\u000aIdk if you already saw it, but I watched this video and everything I've made afterwards has been much better (in the bass department)\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3iwNLIgtK0
p1313
aVThank you very much! I did have trouble getting the bass...
p1314
asVFirst show scheduled for a month from now. I need a bit of advice for my live setup.
p1315
(lp1316
VLet me tell you from experience. I've tried each of the setups and in my opinion running it through your XXX and micing the cab is the best way...unless you have your own sound guy. I also don't like being dependent on the house monitors to hear my guitar, I usually reserve that to hear everyone else for the most part. Really though the POD is so damn versatile you could do it however way you want. I wouldn't worry about the sound in the venue unless its notorious for having a bad mix. If you have time before the show, talk to the sound guy there and ask him what would make his life easier.
p1317
aVThanks!\u000a\u000aWhen you say running the pod through the XXX, do you prefer to run it in the effects loop or to just use the pod for effects and use the amp for tone? (four cable method)
p1318
aVWell it depends on what base tone you prefer to have. Do you like your amps built in distortion/gain over the pod? If so then the 4 cable method is ideal, that way you can double gate in your signal chain. If you prefer your pods simulations then run that through the FX loop and bypass the XXX's preamp all together. Just remember to turn of cab simulation off and it should sound pretty sweet. The second method is basically turning your XXX into a glorified power amp. 
p1319
aVA lot of this would depend on the capabilities of the house PA. What size venue is it? Does the sound guy mic everything, or just the kick + vocals? \u000a\u000aPlus, do you have a dedicated sound check, before doors even open? In typical Los Angeles live music setups, only really big headliner / touring metal acts get sound checks before doors. The grunts have to run a quick check right before they start, so think economically, too. The audience may not want to stand there while you and the sound guy figure out monitoring levels for your cab, on-stage monitors for vocals / guitars /etc, as well as house levels for a cab and a direct-in from your POD at the same time.\u000a\u000aYou say it's your first show - have you ever run just the POD through a house PA with other actual instruments in the mix before? Sorry if these come off as even slightly accusatory - they're not meant to be. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I would say to run your POD through the Peavey's effects loop and just mic the cab. It'll sound way better than just running direct through the PA.
p1320
aVNo, you're right, I literally have never gigged before and I haven't just PA'd it yet. I've been meaning to try that, so I'll rent one in the next couple of weeks.\u000a\u000aThe reason I even thought about this at all was that there are a lot of people online saying they play POD &gt; house and it always sounds amazing for them.\u000a\u000aEdit: I'm going to find out about the dedicated sound check. I hope so!

asVI did a full-band cover of "Laces Out, Dan!" by The Fall of Troy:

aVNot very metal to me, but this is some grade A musicianship. Well done.

asVWe are Skiba! We're a metal band that incorporate thrash/death elements into our own original blend of music. Give us a listen and let us know what you think!
p1326
(lp1327
VI'm sorry, but you do not sound "original" in any way. It's not bad at all, but if you're gonna throw those terms around you have to deliver on them. Now the only reaction I have is that you sound like every other death/thrash band out there. Which is fine if that's what you're aiming for, but then you can't go around claiming to be original.\u000a\u000aOther than that it's not bad. Keep it up, but rethink the way you promote yourself would be my advice.
p1328
aVThese are our first three songs. They were written before I joined the band. Once my vocals were added it gave us something solid to record. But you are right about the sound not being original. The music is evolving as we go and our newer stuff sounds a bit different. I will be more careful of how I word things in the future. Thanks for the feedback!

p1380
(lp1381
VAs a musician and mixer that does primarily hard rock and metal, and genuinely love power metal--and I record in a similar way to how you've described (i.e., I use a PODXT for guitar and bass, ADD drums and others, etc...)  Here's my $0.02...\u000a\u000aI high pass the guitars around 70-90 Hz.  Bearing in mind I use really thick strings that aren't lacking for low-end, so I can go up to around 120 before they start sounding thin.  I roll off that low end so the guitars don't step all over the kick and bass.  After than I usually eliminate some of the super fizzy high end (I do use impulse responses which help, but there's always some highs that want to stab me in the ear) usually focusing on the 8kHz+, depending on the results, I'll either notch it out with a wide Q, do a shelf, or just a low pass; it depends.  After that, I may slap a multiband compressor on a guitar subgroup to mellow stuff out, but that's about it.\u000a\u000aFor drums, I don't really do all that much, honestly.  Addictive Drums (and Steven Slate as well) come out of the box pretty well sampled and sound great.  A lot of EQ choices I make will depend on the other instruments and what effect I'm going for.  Usually, though, if it's matter of the kick not hitting hard enough or getting masked, I'll find the frequencies in the other instruemnts in question and pull those down.  Most of the time with drums I'm working on the high end and presence, making the cymbals audible and clear without having any harshness that'll take someone's head off.\u000a\u000aWith bass, I tend to sidechain some compression to the kick so they're not in the way of each other, and I'll usually EQ out some mids (between the low mids and the high mids).  Occassionally I'll low pass if the high end on the bass is interfering with anything else.\u000a\u000aI treat Keys and synths very similarly to guitars.  I hi pass up to where I feel comfortable and then work on eliminating any conflicting frequencies.\u000a\u000aIn terms of panning (which I haven't mentioned) I do LCR: guitars, keys, effects returns, overheads and room mics, cymbals, toms, all panned hard left and hard right; kick, snare, vocals, bass, solos, etc all up the middle.\u000a\u000aThe biggest thing, I feel, with mixing is deciding what element(s) are the most important at any given point in the song. Not everything can be up front, some things can hang back, some can be little ear ticklers, while at other times other things have to be front and center for the effect you're wanting the song/section/whatever to have.  I've found that if I can decide those things and focus on achieving those, the individual micro decisions come a lot easier with a lot less stress.\u000a\u000aHope this helps

aVBuy a four track so it sounds right and not like someone mixed and mastered it in Pro Tools.
p1406

aVNo, this sub actually really sucks, and you're lucky I got to you before anyone else did. 
p1410
aVHah, I figured as much but gave it a shot. 
p1411
aVI'll give you a little bit of actual advice. \u000a\u000aIf you want to learn how to mix and master stuff, you should just mess around with the sliders and shit in your DAW until it sounds good. It's one of those things you really do have to figure out yourself.
p1412
aVI read a bit about panning drums, which were recorded in mono (so they have more natural panning), and trying to have a perceptive as a listener and not just "how I want it to sound" when mixing. As I've never used Pro Tools, will there actually be a very limited influence I have outside of leveling the audios? And is theyre anything I can purchase that will process the outcome to a better quality? Am I just talking out my ass? 
p1413
aVListen to some really early stuff, like Rigor Mortis, Celtic Frost, shit that sounds *awful*. Your mixes are gonna sound better than those. I'm serious. By listening to what you should improve rather than trying to imitate Terry Date, you will gather a sense of mixing. 
p1414
aV[deleted]
p1415
aVSo what I am understanding is, it's really just how much time you spend leveling out and EQing each audio track? Maybe I'm nuking it. Anyways this is all helpful in trying to clear my thoughts. Though really I am looking less at Terry Date and more at Gerry Bron and Derek Lawrence since it seems like what they recorded was more the style we are going for.\u000a
p1416
aVMy point is to not aspire to imitate the big dudes, but the early recordings. Yours is probably closer to that, since you say you have little experience. You might surprise yourself if instead of getting frustrated for not sounding like In Flames, you feel good about sounding better than Rigor Mortis! ( : 
p1417
aVHah, such optimism. Well in the past 48 hours some disastrous things have happened involving the drummer with the audiofiles, not knowing how export the sessions - deleted the tracks and couldnt dig them up with special software. I live on the opposite side of the country and cannot do anything about it. It was the first recording we could do in 6 months live, and now we have to wait another 6. Ugh.

p1428
aVNot a drummer but am in a band with a highly proficient one. He's always said to me that it's best to learn single kick drum first, so that you get a good understanding of what you can do with just one pedal before you start to see what you you actually need a double pedal for. I've known a bunch of drummer to be able to do the standard thrash beat using a single pedal by utilising the ball and heel independently 
p1429
aVpretty much anything on Craigslist that isn't obviously a kid's set or really broken will be fine, I started on a Walmart First Act set and managed to get decent before it was too broken to play so quality really doesn't matter too much. you should be able to get a complete set cymbals and all for a few hundred bucks.

aVDude, fuck off... Please...
p1452
aVI'm sorry you don't like it man, we're not really trying anything stylewise, I've dressed like this since I was 15 and we're just writing the sort of music we like to listen to and play live but I appreciate your input :)
p1453
aVNot really my type of metal but it sounds pretty good
p1454
aVI just listened to this through some in-ear headphones and it sounded killer! Everything was really clear. I actually wouldn't go overboard on increasing the bass. There were some really great low frequencies coming through.\u000aI think any suggestions are really down to personal preference. I mean, the music is pretty generic but with the quality and obvious ear you seem to have in what you're doing, I'm pretty certain you'll have no problem putting your own unique spin on certain things with time and experience. \u000aI wasn't totally loving the drum sound but again, that's my taste and it wasn't bad per se. I think a less processed sound may have served the overall quality even more. A bit of guitar craziness here and there would also have made it more up my street.\u000aI would blast this in the car for sure and this sort of stuff live is always great fun. Nice one for sharing and all the best with the band. \u000a
p1455
aVThanks so much man, I'll definitely take your comments on board, we have another song that'll be on the ep with some guitar craziness you should like hahaha\u000a\u000aThanks again for the comments means a lot to me that people are taking the time to listen to our stuff :)
p1456
aVDefinitely boost the bass, not just the bass guitar but the kick drum as well. In the chorus all I heard was cymbals and snare.\u000a\u000aI like the breakdown at 1:06, but maybe throw in some variance in the guitar part. It's literally two notes, don't be afraid to play around, even if it's all on the same string.\u000a\u000aOtherwise not bad! Not a big fan of this style but this seemed good for what it was.
p1457
aVThanks very much for your input man! I'll pass it on to the rest of the band :D
p1458
asVHey everyone, check out this new track I produced, mixed and mastered!
p1459

VFantastic job!
p1461
aVThanks!
p1462
aVSolid. Cool outro as well.  What did you do for the drums? What gear did you play record with? 
p1463
aVFor drums, it was a mix of the Avatar kit and Metal Foundry from superior drummer as well as my own custom made samples. Guitars were a PRS Custom 24 DI and reamped using a 5150 III and a Mesa 2x12 with an SM57 into an ART Pro Channel then into a Focusrite Saffire Pro 40. Bass was a Lakland Skyline 5 string DI into a Saffire Pro 40. Vocals were an ST55 from Sterling Audio into an ART Pro Channel and then into a Saffire Pro 40
p1464

asVanyone want to record vocals for me?
p1469
(lp1470
VI may take a crack at it this weekend. Any specific themes/ideas you have in mind?
p1471
aVnot really, just doing this for fun, anything dark I suppose, anything matching the vibe of the music. 
p1472
aVWhat sort of vocal style?
p1473
aVanything from Meshuggah, The Black Dahlia, Veil of maya, Vildhjarta. 
p1474
aVif you still want something let me know. can show you some stuff ive got recorded, have some lyrics i think would fit well too.\u000a\u000a

p1483
asVWould anyone like to help produce some tracks for my band? We wanted to do everything alone but it's hard and we suck. (Melo death)
p1484
(lp1485
VBy producing, do you mean mixing/mastering and whatnot? If yes then I'd be up to giving it a shot. \u000a\u000aHere's the last mix I finished in case you want an idea of what my mixes sound like: https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4tbpcqn11ngs7j/Dualism%20Bounce%205.wav
p1486
aVOh dude this is WAY better than what we've got! This is absolutely perfect!\u000a\u000aWhat song would you like to start on? PM me your email and I can send you those three sets of stems to play with. Would you like ding-ding dry guitar tones or do you want me to make them all chuggy with some VSTs? Either way you wanna do it is fine.\u000a\u000aI've just got the .midis for the drums on Inertia and Silent Veil but have the actual individual drums for ...Of Bashful Light, is that okay?
p1487
aVIf you want I can program the drums using the midi file. The drums you hear in the song are programmed by me so I can use that drum sound for Inertia and Silent Veil, as for ...Of Bashful Light I'll see what I can do with the stems you send and if I can't get a good enough sound out of it I'll probably program it.
p1488
aVThat's cool of you to help them out. :)
p1489
asVHoping to get some feedback on my death metal band!
p1490
(lp1491
VDon't let your drummer go anywhwere.\u000a\u000aAs long as your guitarists can cleanly pull off live what they've got recorded here, you're gold in that department as well.\u000a\u000aBass, no criticisms other than I'd probably actually like a higher presence in the mix. I think the kicks are punchy enough where it wouldn't muddle anything for competing frequencies.\u000a\u000aVocals are servicable if unspectacular. The cadences accentuate the song. The lack of variation in pitch and tambre make it less than outstanding, though there's enough going in the rest of the arrangement as to not draw fault.\u000a\u000aOverall, very solid. 8.5/10, and I'm not even a death metal guy (anymore). Rock on!
p1492
aVWell, this is a band to watch.
p1493
aVKeep doing what you're doing!!
p1494
asVCan you doom on a fretless?
p1495
(lp1496
VUpvote for verbing "doom."
p1497
aVI love doing stuff like that to words, My most commonly used adjective is metal.  And I use science as a noun all the time when Im doing anything requiring any kind of technical skill\u000a"can you ome here for a sec?"\u000a"in a little, I'm doing a lot of science right now"
p1498
aVDoom isn't about your fretboard.  It's about the slow, groovy darkness in your soul.
p1499
aVImagine the slow glissando (i.e., slide) down to an open note. Doomtastic.
p1500
aVExactly! I thought they would sound really evil,  i was just worried it would lunch through the mix\u000a\u000aedit: punch, but keeping the original because of the awesome reply.
p1501
aVI think you can find a way to work around it. Make that mix your lunchbox and eat up.
p1502
aVAll that matters is that it sounds good, noot fitting in. If you like it, roll with it.
p1503
aVAll that matters is fitting into the band's sound, not sounding good alone
p1504
aVWhy don't you get a cheap one from Guitar Center with a 30-day return policy and try it out, then return it and upgrade if you end up liking it? Run it through a Sansamp, B7K Darkglass, Reco sim, R.A.T., etc.- all the sorts of stuff you would normally play through to get a sludgy tone. I've also only ever heard pretty clean tones from fretless metal players (Joe Lester, Dominic Lapointe, etc.) so I suspect it might be a little weird. 
p1505
aVWow...I never actually thought of that.  Even if I don't care for the tone I'd probably keep it because I play a lot of stuff myself.
p1506
aVOnly problem with that would be that cheap fretlesses can suffer from the same problems that plague cheap fretted basses, except with the additional hurdle of being fretless. Could also require some work to get the intonation even usable.
p1507
aVThat's why I said upgrade if you like it ;) I meant it just to establish a baseline for what it sounds like on average. Definitely would not use a GC cheap fretless as a studio instrument!
p1508
aVTrue, but a bad instrument could sour OP on fretless in general. I know if I thought all sixers were like that crappy one I played one time I never would have switched.
p1509
aVShining's bassist uses a fretless, and they occasionally get pretty doomy.

sVI just got my first guitar with a Floyd Rose setup (floating bridge). I've got one big set up problem: I cannot get my lower 2 strings to stay in the hole with the graphite peg. it pulls out every time and I'm having a surprisingly hard time finding info on the issue. Help?
p1518
(lp1519
VI always used to fold the end of the string back over itself like a little hook so the saddle has a bit more to grip.  Never had any issues with doing it that way other than the folding part... you will probably need some pliers and some patience!
p1520
aVHad the same problem the last time I restringed. Putting the string all the way into a hole beneath the peg worked for me. Maybe you could make a 'u' with the end of the string and place the peg inside it? 
p1521
aVIf its a Floyd rose copy or licenced then it may have broken. They break very easy. Pull it out and check for hairline cracks in it.
p1522
aVIs the end of the locking screw in the small hole (should fit perfectly) in the back of the graphite peg? If it is and it still won't work then maybe the peg is broken and you should get a new one.
p1523
asVSteeped in Sable - Don't Want Your Fire
p1524
(lp1525
VI'm gonna say there are some good ideas here.  You could polish up your vocal performance a bit. And it would do your song much more justice if it was captured properly with good recording equipment/software. I don't like the tail of the song repeating all the lyrics from the verses and the chorus - it should be different lyrics all together imho.
p1526
aVThanks! Yeah, I'd like to get this recorded properly some day; I've just been using what I have available.

(lp1529
VYou did a good job, and your tone was great (especially for just a camera mic) but you need to take it slow, practice the song a little more, and use a metronome. You have good technique you just rush, and play too fast in a lot of parts! Again good job, this is my favorite Bodom song :)

sVBest way to make drum tracks on a computer?
p1533
(lp1534
VYou're going to need two pieces of software, one of which you may already have, and possibly one piece of hardware. The first piece of software is a DAW, a digital audio workstation, which is basically the digital equivalent of a recording studio. There are several available: Ableton Live, Logic (Mac only), ProTools, FL Studio, Digital Performer, Reason (not exactly a DAW and might not have all the features you need), Studio One, and probably several others. I've used several and find Ableton Live to be the most intuitive and user-friendly. \u000a\u000aThen you need your virtual instrument, your software drum machine. Again, several available. The Toontrack Drumkit from Hell is the standard for metal and has appeared on releases by Meshuggah and Devin Townsend. I've never tried it; I personally like Addictive Drums. Battery, by Native Instruments, also works well for metal (especially if you want to get a little experimental) but isn't very intuitive.\u000a\u000aThe virtual instrument (VSTi) is a plugin that is hosted by your DAW. When you want to create tracks, you open your DAW, then open the plugin within the DAW, and get to work, either plugging in the MIDI notes manually (ask me if you don't know what MIDI is or don't understand what you read when you look it up) or recording them with a keyboard or another MIDI instrument.\u000a\u000aThe piece of hardware you may or may not need is an audio interface, which allows you to get high-quality sound into and out of your computer. If you have another way getting your guitar and vocal tracks digitized and into your DAW, you won't need it. If you have another way of getting your digital drum tracks out of your computer and mixed with your other instruments, you won't need it. But if you want to record your other instruments directly into your DAW, or record the output of your DAW into a multi-track recorder, you're going to need one of these. Lots of these available with a variety of features and for a variety of platforms.

aVI'm very old school I was looking to the alesis drum machines when a guy at the store pointed out that everyone was using it. I thought it was a lot of money for something I can't physically hold lol. But I am very happy with it and it makes song writing a breeze! You can do anything with it.

aVAre you doubletracking your guitars?  (recording the parts twice and panning them 100% to the left and right, mainly for rhythm guitars)\u000a\u000aThese sound like one track in the center to me, and I pretty much guarantee that doubletracking is the biggest single improvement you could make to your sound right now, since your guitar tone and playing sound good already.  That's just my recommendation, but I reeeeeally suggest that you at least try it out :)
p1546
aV&gt; Are you doubletracking your guitars?\u000a\u000aYes!\u000a\u000a&gt; panning them 100% to the left and right, mainly for rhythm guitars\u000a\u000aNo... That makes a lot of sense though. Thanks for the tip!
p1547
aVOh for sure, my bad for assuming they weren't doubletracked. But yeah panning them is really the key to getting a much bigger, wider and more textured sound!\u000a\u000aMy stuff doesn't sound amazing or anything but I'm always down to help with any kind of recording/producing tips. http://archaeologist.bandcamp.com/album/vol-i-ep

p1549
aVThanks, I'm just doing direct input through Guitar Rig in Logic
p1550
aVOh wow you're stuff sounds really good. That's the kind of sound I'm aspiring to reach. I've got a lot to learn when it comes to this stuff. Thanks a bunch for that tip though. That's exactly what I needed.
p1551
aVThanks man!  My stuff is definitely still a work in progress too, but as long as you keep pushing yourself to learn and improve you'll get there, and it definitely sounds like you're on the right track.  Keep it up!
p1552
aVafter some tips here's my latest effort-\u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/user4081301/salsa-shark
p1553
aVNice, I think that the guitars sound really good now!  Definitely a step up from before.\u000aIs there bass in this track?  Either way, I think it needs more bass haha  
p1554
aVWell this would all be mixing. Mastering comes later. There's far too much information to explain in a reddit comment. So I'd recommend a good mixing guide like the Systematic Mixing Guide. Should help. Its a lot but there's no point in sloppy mixing 
p1555
aVOf course. I wouldn't expect anyone to explain the entire mixing/mastering process to me. Thank you for the recommendation though!
p1556
aVThe sound is good, it's just the mixing (mostly) that needs work. I think the guitars are perfect.\u000a\u000aFor the drums, humanization is going to be a big thing. Try and get acoustic samples, a few different hits of each drum piece. I know there are programs that allow you to just add multiple samples to one slot/bus, and randomize it for you, but its almost always better when done by hand. However, you may randomize the velocity and the pitch by a small percentage automatically if you can.\u000a\u000aOnce you've got some good samples and tones, the next step is mixing. It's tempting to want to pump everything up and make everything equally audible, but you're probably gonna want to reduce the volume of the cymbals and snare. If you're still interested in having a loud sounding drum set, you can worry about side-chaining, but that honestly might have to come later after you get good producing chops first. Also don't be afraid to throw some washy reverb out there with a low cut or high boost on the west signal, just keep it all quiet as to not overwhelm the rest of the sound.\u000a\u000aAfter that is mastering. There are tons of tricks out there to get a better sound: the most popular probably being multi-band compression, and limiting. Another thing you can do is duplicate the whole track and give it a hard reverb again, to the point where the wet signal is barely recognizable from the dry, but then gut a lot of the frequencies from that and throw it waaayy in the back. It will give it some bounciness and air though. A good poor man's multi-compressor is, again, duplicate the track a couple times, and isolate different frequency ranges for each duplication. Then compress, amplify, distort, reverberate, or fuck up any of these frequencies that you want. Even something as stupidly simple as CamelPhat Distortion is a great VST for this. I know there's a lot more to mastering that I'm missing out on so I'll leave it at that.
p1557
aVBTW thanks again for the tips. All this stuff really helped. It was interesting playing around with the multi compressor. Here's my latest effort if you have any additional tips-\u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/user4081301/salsa-shark

aVIn the small amount of time I've spent learning some of the basics of recording, I've realized how immense a task it is to mix and master. I've got a lot to learn and found sooo much more respect for producers. Like this is only a small bit but I bet it's going to take me a while to get the hang of this haha\u000a\u000aGreat advice.

VIt was very good! Well played and put together. The vocals were great too!\u000a\u000aWhat drums are you using for this? It sounds a bit like there is a machine gun effect at around 0:58 where the blast beat kicks in.\u000a\u000aUsually, I would change the individual velocities of each snare hit to give a bit of variation.\u000a\u000aOther than that, I'd say you're golden man. This is good stuff! :)\u000a\u000aI loved the guitar tones aswell, what are you using for those?\u000a\u000aP.S:\u000a1:19 - Is that an explosion? Made me giggle anyway, with the random "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" going on as well.
p1566
aV&gt;What drums are you using for this? It sounds a bit like there is a machine gun effect at around 0:58 where the blast beat kicks in.\u000a\u000aThe program is addictive drums. I've got to stop being lazy and start tweaking velocities more to get a realistic sound. The humanize feature in the midi editor doesn't do the trick for me.\u000a\u000a&gt;I loved the guitar tones aswell, what are you using for those?\u000a\u000aMy guitar is a Schecter Omen 8 w/ stock pickups, as you can tell I'm using it as a 7 string here. All the Vsts I used are free, its a Lepou LE456 and Legion for the guitar tracks and I used free cab impulses I can't remember what they are ATM. \u000a\u000a&gt;P.S: 1:19 - Is that an explosion? Made me giggle anyway, with the random "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" going on as well.\u000a\u000aLol that's a bass drop. It's basically an 808 bass tone that drops in tuning. It's very gimmicky but this is slam so everything is cheesy!\u000a\u000aThanks for the awesome comments!
p1567
aVThat was some nasty stuff. The vocals were evil. I rather enjoyed the track.
p1568
aVMy only complaint was the opening speech was a little lame imo. The vox was executed perfectly though, both in technique and the effects. Tone killed, riffs killed, super energetic and fast. Good mix of old school slam with some Wormed mixed in.

p1583
asVDo you think what constitutes "metal" is open to interpretation?
p1584
(lp1585
VIron Maiden is metal. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. In fact, they're pretty much the definitive metal band. There was a time when metal was more subjective (ex: Metallica was initially called power metal rather than thrash metal), but the lines are generally drawn in the sand when it comes to older stuff.\u000a\u000aThere can be times when it's open to interpretation, but this isn't one of them.
p1586
aVHuh I never knew power metal originally meant thrash metal. I guess I just make an artificial division in my mind between what I call "heavy metal" (power, thrash, styles that generally use conventional verse-chorus-solo song structure) and what I call "metal" (death, prog, in general stuff that has chaotic rarely-repeating song structure). It just seems to me that Maiden has more in common, for example, with AC/DC than with Beneath the Massacre. Sure AC/DC doesn't chug or do sweet harmony solos but the song structure is such a big sticking point for me that I hesitate to group Maiden and Beneath the Massacre together. 
p1587
aVThink of it this way: rock is a huge style of music that encompasses hundreds of styles. Both Molly Hatchet and Airbourne are rock, but one is southern rock, while another is hard rock. In the same sense, Iron Maiden and Cannibal Corpse are both metal, but one is traditional heavy metal and the other is death metal.\u000a\u000aSubgenres have a lot more purpose than you are letting them. Sure, it's true that they're somewhat created by record labels and the media, but they stick because they're useful. If you tell me a band is metal, I don't know enough about them to tell if I'm going to like them. On the other hand, if you say they're thrash metal, I'm almost certain I'll like them. Consistency is an important part to naming subgenres because otherwise they have no meaning.\u000a\u000aAlso, I don't know if power metal used to mean thrash metal. With respect to Metallica, it did (though that might be because one of their demos was called "Power Metal"). In general, subgenres were a little less rigid in the early/mid-80's as they were still being developed. Some bands are still incredibly hard to categorize because they straddled the line well (ex: Metal Church).

aVBeneath The Massacre is deathcore though. Even though they lean more on the metal side of the fence than hardcore. So you're kind of muddying the argument by throwing that in there, by default.
p1589
aVIf I'm going to play into the subgenre game I'd lean much more towards tech death for BTM, sure they have a breakdown every now and then but they're not overusing them in my opinion. But since they do use some breakdowns I guess they could be called deathcore. In the end what I want to get across is that genres and subgenres are an ambiguous way to classify music and nobody should be getting too hung up over another person's classification scheme. After all I think most people outside the metal world think of "heavy metal" as a subgenre of rock, which historically I guess it is.

aVTech Death and Tech Deathcore is often a very fine line.\u000a\u000a&gt; In the end what I want to get across is that genres and subgenres are an ambiguous way to classify music and nobody should be getting too hung up over another person's classification scheme.\u000a\u000aBut the thing is subgenres exist because many people agree on them. 
p1591
aVBlack Sabbath is still metal, and it doesn't sound anything like some of these modern breakdown weedily deedily bs bands that pass for metal nowadays.
p1592
aVMetal theory is open to some interpretation. This old curmudgeon bullshit 'this new stuff ain't metal' is, without a doubt, totally not metal and is a habit of elitist internet fans, non-concert going posers.
p1593
aVBull. I don't think most metalcore/a lot of deathcore is metal and I go to concerts, as do a lot of other people that feel the same way. Nu-metal, too.\u000a\u000aPeople always seem to forget that most of us saying that aren't being malicious- metal=/ good, after all. We're just happen to think that since metalcore came out of punk and most modern metalcore has barely any metal influence, it's punk rather than metal. Is that so wrong? 
p1594
aVRight on answer. I gotta disagree with classifying Deathcore as anything similar to 'metal'core. Metal core is pop with distorted guitars called metal core cuz it's marketable. Much like in the 80s they called that synth pop shit punk rock... Deathcore is actually death metal and hardcore, it's brutal as fuck. I prefer slam death but it's still brutal metal. 
p1595
aV&gt;I gotta disagree with classifying Deathcore as anything similar to 'metal'core. Metal core is pop with distorted guitars called metal core cuz it's marketable.\u000a\u000aMetalcore covers a massive range of sounds, mate. It can mean anything from 90's metallic hardcore (Hatebreed, Shai Hulud, Converge, Botch, etc) to mathcore (also Converge and Botch, The Dillenger Escape Plan, etc) to early 00's Gothenburg/thrash influenced metalcore (Trivium, As I Lay Dying, Unearth, etc) to bands toeing the line with between -core and Pantera worship (Lamb of God, Sylosis, Chimaira, etc) to later post-hardcore + early metalcore (Asking Alexandria, whatever's on the front page of /r/metalcore, etc). Out of those, the 00's Gotherburg/thrash and the groovey metalcore can be considered metal- the riffs are more metal, though hardcore influences are more evident than they would be in pure thrash, melodeath, or groove.\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;Deathcore is actually death metal and hardcore, it's brutal as fuck.\u000a\u000a\u000aSimilarly, deathcore's sound can range between stuff that's basically the harsher side of metalcore + death metal (early Whitechapel, early The Red Chord, All Shall Perish, Acrania, Thy Art Is Murder) to metalcore with a death metal tone, more chugging and breakdowns than not, and occasional death-y riffs (later Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, various crappy Hot Topic bands). More deathcore than metalcore is metal, to be certain, but a lot of the Hot Topic bands have very little metal influence past their tone and vocalists- they're basically bad downtuned/dropped lowest string hardcore with growls. \u000a\u000aWill I call early Whitechapel metal? Absolutely. Will I call a band that just chugs along with no obvious lineage to Sabbath and Priest metal? Nope.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Some metalcore/deathcore is metal, some isn't, and I feel like I just spent more time than I should have on a typeup nobody's gonna read.
p1596
aVI read it lol, it's pretty watertight too. Great examples. Any argument would just be splitting hairs. Just try not to use the phrase 'Panetta worship' is a derogatory way... not a bad read... thoughts on Grindcore vs tech death?
p1597
aVI don't mean it in a bad way- it's just what it is, just like how a lot of the death metal I listen to is Incantation or Death worship and how some of my favorite thrash is Morbid Saint worship. Guess I could have said "Exhorder worship" as well (or just left it at "groove metal", but that'd be less likely to be true- Pantera is way more popular, after all. \u000a\u000a&gt;thoughts on Grindcore vs tech death?\u000a\u000aI love grind, though I'm not as familiar with it as I probably should be. Favorite bands- Wormrot, Napalm Death (Scum to Harmony Corruption, I think?), Terrorizer, Carcass (early), Liberteer. Def need to up my grind game- probably going to hit Insect Warfare and some other essentials tomorrow to level the playing field.\u000a\u000a I like some tech death (Artificial Brain, Suffocation, Cryptopsy, Wormed, Atheist, Cynic, Death, Hellwitch, Desultor, Ulcerate, Gorguts, Necropolis, Exmortus, some others) but I really, really don't like the current wave of tech-wank with clean production- I'd rather listen to non-technical death that has good riffs than some Necrophagist-meets-Opeth band without many cool riffs.\u000a\u000aI've heard some cases of tech death and grind meeting in the middle- not a ton, and none I can remember off the top of my head, tbh, but definitely some- that sounded pretty cool, but in general, I just don't listen to a ton labeled "tech"- tends to have fewer cool riffs, and I really do listen to metal mostly for cool riffs. \u000a\u000aNo hate on people that love tech or the bands- they're just a trend I'm not particularly fond of.\u000a
p1598
aVBut you agree it's a little weird having Sabbath and breakdown-heavy shit in the same genre? They don't sound anything alike to me either.
p1599
aVThat's what subgenres are for. 
p1600
aVMmmm. Although I agree with you in principle, I don't think this is the case anymore. 'Metal' is no longer a category that has sub-genre's within it. 'Metal' seems to mean 'Whatever the most current popular overall sound of metal is'.\u000a\u000aIron Maiden would be classified as Heavy Metal now. 'Heavy Metal' was originally a category that had it's own sub-categories (in the same way that 'Metal' used to be), but now it's a genre all on it's own.\u000a\u000aThe 'Metal' description seems to be the equivalent of 'Pop', but for heavy music. When you talk about 'Pop' music, the yardstick of what is considered 'Pop' wavers depending on what's currently in vogue. Such is the same for 'Metal'.\u000a\u000aI'm not saying I agree with that at all, but that's just how it appears to be. I would prefer it if 'Metal' was still a generic category.
p1601
aVMy understanding is that [pop is actually a genre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music) distinct from "popular music" even though that's where the term derives from. Rap and rock are both very popular but don't fall under pop, for example. \u000a\u000aSimilarly, metal is a genre. It has nothing to do with what's in vogue- it's based on shared musical characteristics.

p1603
aVWell let's hope so. As I said, I'd much prefer that people think Metal is still a genre, but I've had a lot of discussions on that topic recently and unfortunately I don't think that's the case :(
p1604
aVIf people don't think metal is a genre, those people are uneducated on the subject. It's really that simple, m8.
p1605
aVNothings ever simple. You and I can rant however much we like that Metal is a category of music rather a genre all of it's own, but if the general populace do not hold that to be true then we become the ones who are wrong. In much the same way, I knew a loy of older people in the 90's who would swear blind that 'Grunge is just punk-rock, stop calling it grunge,', and I just laughed and said 'Yeah, get with the program grandad.'
p1606
aVNo, I mean, music genres are literally based on music theory and no amount of ignorance about music theory can change that- that's like saying that science changes because so many people have misconceptions about it.\u000a\u000aIf metal stopped being a genre, well, all of the current bands would be part of the same genre still, it'd just be called something else. \u000a\u000aPeople have been calling non-classical music "classical" for ages and music theorists just ignore them. 
p1607
aVScience does change.\u000a\u000aFor a very long time it was scientific fact that the Earth was flat. We look back and think that's very silly now because we have observed the world as a sphere. But if you had lived back then, you be arguing vehemently against anyone who said otherwise.\u000a\u000aAny 'theory' as such is only held to be true when you have a large enough amount of the population that believe in it, hence, being called a theory. There have been more than one type of musical theory throughout human history arising from different cultures and such. It's kind of unified now, but even still, uniquely human.\u000a\u000aSo I'm afraid I don't agree with you that things are ever set in stone. Even though there may be wikipedia articles that attempt to categorise and classify things, those are just static snapshots that represent the opinions of the people that wrote them at the time. Music has a long repeating history of the younger generations adapting, changing and renaming their music and it always pisses off the previous generation, who did their own adapting, changing and renaming.
p1608
aVThere are some good answers here, but I want to add that I think you're getting the purpose of genres backwards.\u000a\u000aGenres exist so that we can classify and group works (songs, albums, whatever) that have ALREADY been created. No one ever sat down and said "I'm going to create a new genre called Technical Death Metal" and started writing an album. It really works the other way around; we already had a genre called Death Metal with its own established rules, some bands just started going in a specific direction with it that was different than what other bands had done before them. We as metal fans started to get a feel for what those differences were (whether consciously or subconsciously) and started calling those bands Tech Death instead of just Death Metal.
p1609
aVThis reminds of when a student goes to into their first Algebra course, and it's all fairly straight forward early on. But the fact that they missed out on some basic concepts earlier in middle school means the rest of the year is overcomplicated and things don't match up, and they're pulling at all the crumpled notes they took just trying to make meaning of it all, and they just keep nodding "yeah i get it...no i don't need help". I think you may have missed one of those pre-algebra classes. 
p1610
aVCould very well be, I haven't listened to older metal in years. But unlike mathematics which is self-consistent and proceeds only by indisputable proofs, the names of genres are just labels made up by record companies and the media. So I guess I just don't see why they need to be so set in stone.  
p1611
aV&gt; genres are just labels made up by record companies and the media.\u000a\u000aThis makes no sense record companies don't invent a genre and then get a band to make music in that genre - the companies get a band to release an album and the listeners, the metalheads, classify it in order to easily identify and a share the music. \u000a\u000aAnti-classification is so irrational I don't comprehend how there's a whole group of people promoting it. It would be like biologists promoting that they get rid of the Latin naming conventions because 'reasons'
p1612
aVWell they made them up after the fact to group bands together based on similarities that people may or may not agree are good similarities to base it on. That makes it even worse in my opinion because in many cases a band will not accept the subgenre they are filed into, for example The Red Chord has said several times they hate being called "deathcore" because that wasn't even a thing when they started making music. 
p1613
aV&gt;Well they made them \u000a\u000aThey being musicologists and fans educated on the subject, mind. \u000a\u000a
p1614
aVI think metal is a unique genre in a sense that you can quantify how accurately it matches a desired archetype. While metal has flowered into a dozen different sub-genres and encompases all sorts of musical ideas, tones, techniques and disciplines, metal music still has a common denominator: it's *extreme*. Bands we consider more extreme, we consider to be more metal than bands that are less extreme. That's why you get so many more metalheads with strong allegiances to bands like Gorgoroth or Deicide, throwing up the horns and saying *that's so metal* than you do with oldschool bands these days. It also explains why there are a lot of young guys who don't see Iron Maiden as metal. Relatively speaking, they aren't *extreme metal*, but they're still *extreme*, and thus metal. You personally might disagree, but they still employ distorted guitars, advanced technique, speed, and dark (or at least masculine, powerful, energetic) lyrics.\u000a\u000aWhere it gets confusing is when you throw punk or hardcore into the mix. I think the rivalry between the two genres exists because one audience thinks their music is more extreme than the other. Most 80's metalheads labeled themselves as such because they thought the advanced speed and technicality of metal fused with its dark imagery out-disgusts the raw primal anger and noisiness of punk. That argument has largely been replaced with the modern rivalry between metalcore and "false metal", or the commercialization of punk rock, alternative, and hardcore mixed with a few metal elements like heavy tone and technicality. Puritan metalheads see the less extreme features of this music like emo styled lyrics, clean or whiney singing, and pop hooks and bridges as grounds to exclude it from metal. They have a point, but their iron stubbornness gets in the way of people trying to enjoy the music, not to mention that in some instances people dismiss legitimately *good* bands as bad ones solely on the basis that they aren't as metal as they could be, which is a fallacy because metalness =/= goodness.
p1615
aVI get what you are saying, but if anything, the old stuff if "metal" and this new stuff has outgrown it and should have a new name.\u000a\u000aI'm not saying I agree with that, but I'm saying you have it backwards. \u000a\u000aAnyway, if I answer your question without reading the additional info, yes. Yes, metal is open to interpretation. Solstafir will be posted on the same site as Gojira and Black Sabbath. Does it sound similar? Nope.\u000a\u000aBut then again, Black Sabbath used to tour with Megadeth. How alike do they sound? A lot less similar than Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet one is rock, one is metal. Am I jumping around in my argument? Yup. It's because it doesn't matter too much. It's all noise that we name.\u000a\u000aI'm that guy who hears -core music and tells my friends, no that's not really metal. Do they understand why? Nope. But it doesn't really matter.
p1616
aVHah okay I guess I will start calling it "br00tal metal" or something around here. It's just common amongst my circle of friends to refer to death metal and its offshoots as "metal" and to anything -core as "hardcore" so I was wondering what everybody here thinks the "metal" means in metalmusicians

aV*Disclaimer: I don't at all keep up with currently accepted terminology, so I could be totally talking out of my ass here, but this is the view from Mt. Wombat*\u000a\u000aWhile I know what you mean and I largely agree that OVER-genrefication (real word? maybe? Whatever; it is now.) makes things way too complex, especially when there are like 4 bands in each genre because it is way too specific, I do have to say that we do indeed need SOME genrefication to make conversations easier and make comparisons more clear. \u000a\u000aThat said, Maiden is indisputably metal, dude. I think it would be fair to lump many early metal bands into a "classic metal" group to more easily distinguish them from modern thrash or power or whatever metal genre that has had significant growth since they were established. On the other hand, I don't think it would at all be out of place to still call those bands thrash or power or whatever, but stripping out the metal moniker altogether would be inaccurate, IMO.\u000a\u000aTo the point of your question though, I think there's always a little bit of room for interpretation, but it sounds to me like you're kinda changing definitions there. I've never personally seen "heavy metal" used as an actual genre aside from just being a synonym for metal in general, and it isn't particularly descriptive as to what it means so I wouldn't personally say that it works very well. \u000a\u000atl;dr Definitely too many genres; still need some of them; "heavy metal" lacks specificity; sounds like dudes you were talking to may be a bit pretentious and you may be trying to reinvent the wheel. Namsayin'?\u000a

aVYeah. I phrased that comment wrong. Like, stereotypical core shit is garbage. (See: attack attack, asking alexandria, blessthefall) but I mean I love Born of Osiris and Within the Ruins which are more tech/prog deathcore.

VAs a general rule, it is better for your mix to be "too quiet" than loud as it leaves headroom for the Mastering Engineer to do his job. Your priorities should be something like this:\u000a\u000a\u000a* Make sure NOTHING is clipping. All of your recorded tracks and subsequent processing should not have anything going "in the red."\u000a\u000a\u000a* Once you're sure nothing is clipping, you can start to look at levels more carefully. A lot of Mastering Engineers like to have *at least* 6db of headroom to work with on your mix bus/stereo bus/master track. So, in terms of track volumes, you'll want to find a good level for some key elements in your mix (most people start with kick and snare) and then adjust everything in relation to them. Your end result will likely sound quiet and wimpy (not to be confused with sounding *bad*). \u000a\u000a\u000a* If you're feeling particularly scrutinous, look into *Gain Staging* to get a better understanding of where your levels should be. There is some debate as to whether or not maintaining proper gain structure in a digital production setting is absolutely necessary, but understanding gain staging will at least give you some perspective on what to shoot for. \u000a\u000a\u000aFinally, I don't think I've ever seen raw mixes released that didn't involve some mastering-like processing, so you're probably not going to find much that is helpful. Even "demos" that are released as bonus tracks usually have some kind of mastering and, at the very least, a limiter that has brought their volume levels up so the tracks don't stick out so much from the rest of the album. [Here](http://blackdogmastering.com/Mastering_Samples.html) are some samples from an online mastering service website where you can compare the "Before" and "After". Just keep in mind that the site is trying to attract clients, so the "before" clips might not be the most accurate representations of an unmastered mix. \u000a\u000a\u000aSo, to recap in short: no clipping. Enough headroom. Good volume balance among individual tracks in the mix. Don't worry about volume comparison to finished products (your mix will be substantially quieter than these). 
p1634
aVI would add to this that killing everything above / below certain frequencies can also help tremendously with creating headroom, and will also help a track sound even better when well-mastered.\u000a\u000aIn addition, for those looking to mix their own stuff I strongly advise finding some tutorials on how to mix using cuts instead of boosts. Learn how to sweep across the band for each instrument to find out it's sweet spots and then create "room" for that's instrument primary vocalization range across the tracks. 
p1635
aVI would like to add that it's important to have a consistent workflow. When I mix I take everything down to zero (which is actually -infinity because zero is actually the loudest point... but you get the idea) and bring the drums up to around -16db. Then bring the bass up. The bring the guitars up, etc.
p1636
aVThanks I think the main issue I have been having is trying to get that mastered sound in the mixing stage because I haven't heard a professional mixed but not mastered recording. \u000a\u000aIs it the best idea to bounce down to a stereo track or just master on the "master" bus after mixing if I want to give it a go myself?\u000a\u000aI have a set of m-audio cx5's (but not a treated room) but I am able to reference using my focusrite VRM box and my Sony V6 headphones(not the best headphones ever but the response sounds pretty flat) so I do want to at least give it a go as I am a hobby musician so any advice is helpful!
p1637
aVI'm a hobbyist myself who is recently getting into production, so I'm no expert by any means. \u000a\u000a\u000a&gt; Is it the best idea to bounce down to a stereo track or just master on the "master" bus after mixing if I want to give it a go myself?\u000a\u000a\u000aI would personally treat mastering as a separate project by bouncing to a stereo track (or stems if you want more flexibility). My reasoning is twofold: 1) you won't worry about CPU usage and/or messing up your already full mix cluttered with a bunch of plugins, and 2) if nothing else, treating it as an entirely separate project might help you approach mastering from a better psychological viewpoint (i.e., you can see it as a "ground zero" that you need to improve rather than something you can go back and tweak a bunch of stuff in). \u000a\u000a\u000aMy personal view is that people who mix the music shouldn't master the music, especially for home studios. When I pay for mastering, I'm essentially paying for two things I don't have: the ears and the equipment. Even if I'm lucky enough to have high-quality mastering gear, I still have neither the understanding to use it nor the experience/objectivity required to analyze the mix and see where it can be improved.  But, of course, if learning and the experience is your goal as a hobbyist over quality, then this doesn't matter. \u000a\u000a\u000aAlso, I recently just bought Slate Digital's FG-X mastering plugin to "master" (really just bring the volume up) my personal demos. It's pretty solid and was on sale for $100 (though you also need an iLok, which is an additional $50 if you don't already have it). \u000a\u000a\u000aGood luck and keep on mixing, my friend!
p1638
aVI think your 2nd point makes alot of sense actually! Thanks I will check out FG-X too.\u000a\u000aI am not against the idea of paying for someone else to master it either though but I do like the idea of at least giving it a go myself even as a learning experience!
p1639
aVI forgot to mention that a lot of mastering services will provide a free sample on one of your songs, so you can always ask for a sample and compare it to your own mastering to see if the cost would be worth it to you on important projects. 
p1640
aVthis guy helped me a lot... of course, he did use some vst that pretty much worked its magic instantaneously:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amN1EmZv4Uo
p1641
aVThanks for that I am checking it out now.  That actually helped me understand where I am going wrong. I think my problem is I keep trying to make my mixes have that mastered sound and I don't know what it is meant to sound like before mastering so I am making the guitars too loud to get that mastered sound when I realised that the mastering stage brings those up so much when I watched that video.
p1642
aVI always thought mixing was the part where you get the instruments and/or effects sounding right, without worrying about the volume that much.\u000a\u000aMastering is the part where you blend all of it together and set the volume levels.\u000a\u000aSomeone correct me if I'm totally wrong.

aVMastering is the process that takes a good final mix and brings the levels up to where we are accustomed to ( the argument of if that is good or bad and why is a whole separate topic ). Sonic maximization these days is not just limited to volume, perceived volume plays in a lot in most modern recordings. In addition, there can frequently be other small things done in the mastering process to make it sound larger or more present, like small stereo-separation, etc.\u000a\u000aWhen you bring in a recording to be mastered, you do not give them all the separate tracks ( like your Logic or ProTools file ). You bring in a singular mixed track, so things like adjusting the volume of an individual instrument cannot be done at that stage.\u000a
p1644
aVThat was pretty informative! TIL
p1645
aVMixing deals with individual tracks. Mastering deals with the album as a whole.
p1646
aVYeah I think you are right there.  I think the problem I am having is what volume to have the instruments when compared to each other and how much headroom to leave before mastering.  For example I have a habit of turning the guitars up too loud over the drums which I have realised after watching the youtube video posted above.\u000aThis has been helpful thanks everyone
p1647
aVMake it sound as good as you can when mixed. The mastering process makes up for errors done in mixing.\u000a\u000aI suggest you read [THIS](http://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/so-you-think-youve-finished-mixing-a-guide-to-preparing-your-mix-for-mastering--audio-6083).\u000a\u000aI personally don't have any unmastered tracks. Both times I've been in the studio the pre-master mixes we've received seems to have some sort of master preset put on them to raise the volume.\u000a\u000a
p1648
aVRespectfully disagree strongly.\u000a\u000aMastering does not "fix mixing errors" - it exemplifies them. Generally when doing a final mix, you want to have everything sound fantastic and wonderful, and have passed / shelved all items typically outside the audible frequency to create headroom for the mastering process.\u000a\u000aMastering should be the clear-coat that makes the paint job sparkle. If you screw up the multi-stage paint on your car, no amount of clear coat will make it "shine more" - it just makes the shit stand out more. But with a great paint-job, that clear-coat really helps provide a sheen that makes it look even more polished.

asVJust released an album that took way too long to make, "Eyes Cut Open"
p1650

Vsounds well made
p1652
aVThank you :)
p1653
aVWith a name like "Eyes Cut Open" I was expecting something *way* more brutal. But holy shit, I don't know if you'd call this progressive or what... regardless I love it. Very good work. And is that Rime of the Ancient Mariner riff at the end of Winter Clouds and Dark Gestures intentional? 
p1654
aVNot intentional but I guess it's not too surprising if a riff or two sound a bit like maiden considering the style the album ended up with.\u000aAlso thank you for the kind words :)
p1655
aVYeah, definitely wasn't a criticism. Huge Maiden fan here... really dig the vibe of the album. \u005cm/
p1656
aVI just have to say I was blown away. I had Spotify up and forgot I switched to your album. I was about to send my friend some lyrics I was writing while listening to it. I went to look at what band was playing and noticed it was paused. I can't believe this is so good. \u000a\u000aI am going to buy a copy later. Saved so I remember. 
p1657

asVSolo metal project....need vocals on them if anyone on here can record some metal vox pm me and i'll send a clean mp3. Also open to criticism.
p1659
(lp1660
VTo beef up your guitar, try recording 2 separate performances and pan them hard L and hard R. It will give it a stereo effect. You can go as far as having 4 separate tracks. 2 track panned hard R and L, then 2 tracks panned 70 R and L. This requires a click track to make sure you play as tight as you can.
p1661
aVMost of these have at least two guitars panned 50% left and right with a separate center I like panning but I like it to sound good mono too for my ghetto p.a. rig at practice. Thanks for comment though I will mess with the idea some and post result soon.
p1662
aVIf panning that way works for you as a musician, then that's awesome! You might want to consider making a separate mix for people who wish to **enjoy** your music! Let them appreciate the full spectrum of their stereo systems. You don't have to pan your guitars 100% L or R, but anything more than 80% in each direction is ideal. Some guys will pan their main rhythm guitars 100% left &amp; right and only in certain spots have a 3 and 4th guitar at around 50% left &amp; right! There's no wrong way to do it, but you have to remember that if you wish for anyone to enjoy your music, then you MUST cater to them to some degree. Be it in how you pan your guitars to how you blow your dad, people have a threshold.That threshold most likely is based on opinion of what sounds good, and most of that has come from dudes that have been paid far too little to accomplish too much and all of it is more than any one of us can usually expect to make.... Ever.
p1663
aVI agree but I feel like your being a bit extreme. Like I said I pan that way cause I plug into a p.a. that only has left and plenty of people have enjoyed listening to it on my phone and not mentioned panning. I've enjoyed lots of live bootlegs I do strive to have it be more and more polished but sometimes rawness can be cool and overproduced crap on the radio is no good.   I don't disagree with panning at all lol I enjoy it unpanned and I am anyone so its a bit elitest to say its impossible to enjoy unpanned I like it a little raw and there at countless live albums that are one mic bootlegs that I love.. Most people I assume would be listening on a laptop regardless here's some shit I panned https://soundcloud.com/metalfreak-2/pannedguitarscomplete1 
p1664
aVhttps://soundcloud.com/metalfreak-2/pannedguitarscomplete1   thanks for tip I did this panned with two slightly different riffs panned all the way left and right with bass 70 to right it does make it feel bigger with headphones or nice stereo. Still have to make a mix were its panned 100 left so I can hear all the parts when I play along through ghetto p.a. lol thanks for suggestion though I will end up remixing this stuff over and over.

aVWhat vocals do you have in mind?
p1666
aVAttila? Check comments for more but I like multi style songs\u000a
p1667
aVYeah, that's pretty broad. Do you want clean/scream/harsh/gutteral or what? I can cook you up a track full of bree bree if that's what you want lol :)
p1668
aVAnything unique I like it to have multiple types of metal vocals within one song. Iwrestledabearonce Attila I like it heavy not too much Singy stuff but slipknot I like little rap metal sections. So broad I guess is correct if you feel a certain style run with it I would just love to hear this stuff with vocals.
p1669
aVIf I eat enough chilli and beer I could fart into a mic, could come out pretty wet sounding.
p1670
aVMushroom head is a better example of two vocalists. I would really like to blow this out with two singers per track would be cool to hear mixed styles/takes. Keep pming don't be lazy it'll be fun.
p1671
asVHere's a prog metal tune I've been working on, got a little bit of influence from The Faceless and Meshuggah, and gets a little fusion-y as well. Minimal djent content, i promise! POD HD500, SD2, Trillian... Let me know what you think!
p1672
(lp1673
VThis was pretty cool dude....pretty epic, a little ambient at times. Def see the faceless and shug influence on it. Keep it up. 
p1674
aVGlad you liked it :)
p1675
aVThis is awesome. It's a bit djenty (esp. around 2:40 onwards) but I really like it. Eventually hating djent will go out of vogue and we can stop pretending things aren't djent-y when they really are....
p1676
aVThis is great, dude!\u000a\u000aHopefully that's just the working title though... :)
p1677
aVThanks! And ha, yes, this was just something I had been working on the past couple days, nothing's really set in stone, especially the title!
p1678
aVI like it and am able to do so without labeling it :)
p1679
aVI thought you said Prog. \u000a\u000aThis isn't Progressive at all. \u000a\u000aAlso, there was minimal Metal. It was mostly Djent. 
p1680
aV&gt; labels, labels, bullshit, labels\u000a\u000aAlso, wikipedia disagrees with you... \u000a\u000a"Djent /\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnt/[1] is a style of heavy metal music that developed as a spinoff of traditional progressive metal.[2][3]"\u000a\u000aTherefore, "mostly Djent" would imply progressive and metal.
p1681
aVI mean, I think it sounds pretty similar to a lot of prog metal I listen to, namely the bands I listed as influences in the title.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't expect vanilla metal to break from heavy and fast to an odd chord progression with dissonant bass and melody over it.\u000a\u000aThe only part of this that I think could be classified as "djent" is only a small portion of the song and is much more similar to Meshuggah than to other "djent" bands like monuments/intervals/whatever other trendy thing that's going on right now. \u000a\u000aAnd the point has been made, but djent is a subgenre of prog metal. So saying that it's mostly djent but not prog metal, doesn't really seem to make much sense. \u000a\u000aI'm definitely open to criticism and I welcome it, but I would prefer it to be constructive and coherent when I do receive it. Perhaps I shouldn't label the music anything and let it speak for itself! \u000a\u000a
p1682
aVThe Faceless and Meshuggah aren't Prog. They're Djent. Djent isn't Progressive, it's lazy and structureless. \u000a\u000aGo listen to Spiral Architect, Elegy, or maybe Beyond Twilight. That's Progressive. 
p1683
aVI've never before heard The Faceless described as "djent" so much as "Technical Death Metal". And while tech death might not be considered " progressive metal " necessarily, it certainly isn't lazy and structureless. Have you listened to The Faceless' latest album, AutoTheism? Because I would highly recommend it.
p1684
aVI heard the usage of nonstandard time signatures as well as elements of jazz in the song, both of which I believe are considered heavy elements of progressive metal. 
p1685

p1691
aVPractice makes perfect
p1692
aVI like where you're going with it and I think its the framework of something really awesome. The thing that I noticed that I think could use the most change would be that both the vocals and the instruments seem to be fairly static. By static I mean that they're lacking a dynamic quality that I think would really carry the music more and would be more like what I prefer to hear in melodeath, if that makes any sense. I guess what I'm trying to say is I think it needs more melody; it's got the death part, but not so much the melodic. \u000a\u000aThat said, I don't really know dick about making music yet. I've been a metalhead for almost 20 years, but I've only been actually learning about music at all for maybe a year and a half, so I'm still quite solidly a noob on the technicalities. \u000a\u000aAnywho, keep it up and I look forward to hearing more from you\u000a\u000a
p1693
aVAs vocalist I'm gonna chime in briefly.  I was pushing my low ends very hard for this one, so that could be why vocals were iffy.  We're gonna try to make the next one more in my range to see how it works out.  Thanks for the criticism!
p1694
aVThanks, I think I see what you mean, and we'll definitely be looking to implement the more melodic/dynamic aspect in future, I was a little focused on the brutal, Amon Amarth-type sound, but I'm working now on something that sounds kinda Soilwork-ish, so there should hopefully be a bit of growth on that front.  Thanks again.
p1695
aVGuitars sounds like you're running it through a fuzz box, which thins out the sound and loses the "crunch" you usually hear in any kind of death metal. But I don't know what your setup is so I can't tell you how to change it. It just sounds more like Minstry than any death metal I've heard\u000a\u000aThis video might explain it better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZpHkv7hNuY\u000a\u000aOn drums, the snare is too loud with respect to the bass drum, but I don't know how your program works can't really help you there.
p1696
aVI am using a fuzz, EHX Metal Muff, like it for the squeals.  I was actually rather unaware of the nuances of fuzz/distortion, glad I know now for better work on my tone.  I'm looking into better things distortion-wise, better amp, etc... Hopefully that'll be able to happen before we start into serious work on the next song.\u000aOn the drums we were having a *lot* of trouble making the kick loud enough, will do better next time, all part of the learning experience I guess.  Thanks a lot for the input Bro.

p1709
aVDoooo itttt
p1710
aVI don't have any deep or profound reasons, really.\u000a\u000aI never imagined myself as a guy playing any instrument in a band, I've always focused more on vocals, and it so just happened that in high school a friend who was into metal too heard me growl on top of something while drunk one friday night and asked if I'd like to join his band. He had been the bassist-vocalist up until that point. The first months I sucked bad, had never played with a band before, just growling and shrieking alone on top of my favourite songs.\u000a\u000aOur first demo was pretty horrible, in retrospect, but damn it if I wasn't proud of it back then. It sort of kept my motivation up, believing I would improve with time, and after 7 years in the band and listening back to the first demo, I can proudly say I have. \u000a\u000aI like the guys in my band, we share a lot of bands we like (with me being the only exception who really listens to black metal), and we go well together as a band. And that is all that matters.\u000a\u000a[For those interested, you can listen to our latest demo here. I'm on the vocals, if that wasn't clear by now.](https://soundcloud.com/chaotech/sets/exist-remaster)

p1712
aVExpression. Painters express their feelings through the brushes on a canvas. I express my feelings through instrumentation and it's quite obvious how I feel when I write certain songs.\u000a\u000aMy lyrics are typically philosophical or just stories, however. The real feelings come through the guitar and drums.
p1713
aVPerfection. I try to make what represents, in my opinion, the best metal in the world.
p1714
aVI've always been heavy into music and Metal happens to be my favorite genre.\u000a\u000aAlso, Tosin Abasi, Josh Travis, Jason Richardson, Angel Vivaldi, and Misha Mansoor are my true idols.

p1724
aVI like this. I feel this way about it as well; we make music for us. That's a great way of putting it. 
p1725
aVI have a bunch of different creative outlets that I toy with because to me, when I create, I get to be God. The world I try to create (be it a song, story, or poem) is only that way because I say it is. I'd love to get into acting and possibly writing but music is what I have experience with right now and it's something I can just embrace my introversion with. Also, I'm just a big fucking nerd. I love anime, comics, and superhero movies and I love how fitting metal music is to those wonderful fantasy/sci-fi genres.
p1726
aVI'm jussi getting into the "playing God" ideal\u000a. I started to feel how powerful I could make music when I embraced this ideal. I'm actually writing a melodeath action-based, espionage themed romance album. I've wanted to experiment with the idea of metal and a badass love story. Also, having multiple singers in a song, like a duet or a trio of some fucking intense screamers/growlers. I think it's gonna be sick, at the very least it's gonna be hella fun.

aVI hope that turns out really well for you. That's certainly the most unique idea I've heard of.

Cool effects in the chorus as well.\u000a\u000aThe music although nothing particularly new is a pretty solid base and kinda catchy. I checkout out a few of your other songs and they seemed to be less (for lack of a better word) predictable, in terms of like riff creation, which I believe is a good thing.

p1744
aVLearn solos you like, and figure out WHY you like them. Techniques, modes, etc that stand out to you. Break them down and piece them together in your own way.
p1745
aVI agree - it's not enough to just practice someone else's solo - you need to look at it and try and work out why you like it. What are they doing that stands out? Maybe it's playing techniques, maybe it's melodic ideas, maybe it's rhythmic ideas, etc. Understand the building blocks, then build your own.

aVMarty Friedman

aVScales are a really good thing.  I sounds cheesy, but they are just as good as learning other peoples solos in upping your game.  It'll help you be more creative when you start writing your own too.
p1748
aVI know this answer totally blows, but it really is just practice.\u000a\u000aI've found that what works for me, is taking a lick from a solo, or a whole solo, and just chilling on the couch while watching TV or something and just playing it at the slowest speed possible for me that feels totally comfortable. \u000a\u000aI did that for a little while and then suddenly I could play those parts much faster when I tried. \u000a\u000a
p1749
aVPlay to jam tracks. It's a good way to work on improv and find out what licks work for different phrases and chords. It also allows you to work on finding the notes in key on the entire neck. Probably the most important thing, though, is unlike trying to getting a jam session together with other people, you get to practice by yourself. That means no one is going to judge you if you sound like shit wanking around on guitar.
p1750
aVIn my opinion, just fiddle around on the guitar, listen to music and if a part of a song or solo catches your ear then learn it.  Once you've learned it you can apply it to other positions and alter it to sound more original plus pair it with other phrases you've learned
p1751
aVPlaying or writing? Either way; practice.
p1752
aVI think this person is wondering what specifically should they be practicing. Just saying "practice" isn't going to help someone who doesn't have musically inclined people surrounding them to go to. Maybe they feel overwhelmed by the amount of information online and are just looking for a starting point. Maybe they are proficient at some parts of soloing but feel as if they're stagnating. Try helping them out a little more than just saying "Practice."

VPods are good\u000aBut it will come down to the speaker more than the pod. \u000a\u000aEdit: posted too early,\u000aI would think about getting something like a B-52 PA system. It works really well. Additionally you could get a wireless transmitter and a mixer and have everyone wear ear buds. That really maintains a good sounds quality and is cheaper as a whole.

aVYeah I've used two of those units for my guitar and it worked really well

aVthe second part is actually win when you are in a small space, run everything through the mixer and then you hear everything clear and can run a click behind it. If everyone learns to play to the click you never have timing issues.

asVGood and cheapish recording setup?
p1800
(lp1801
VRecording gear is one of those things you really don't want to skimp on. Cheap gear can be unreliable and break down easily, especially if you're new to home recording. That said, there are quite a few options which are cheaper and reliable.\u000a\u000aMicrophone: to start, I really recommend using an XLR (standard mic cable connection) and interface setup rather than going with a USB mic. It allows you to swap gear for future purchases and often provides more reliable options. For most home recording setups, you cant go wrong with Shure brand mics. They're durable, relatively cheap, and used in studios and live sound setups across the country. For all around instrument use, use the SM57. For vocals, the SM58 is generally better (though a 57 can be used in a pinch). These two mics are industry standard, by which I mean you will probably find at least 4 of each in every good studio across the globe. For about $100 a piece you can't really go wrong.\u000a\u000aInterface: this is another component in which you are bombarded with a lot of choices. What you'll likely want is an interface with two inputs which can handle both XLR and 1/4 inch TRS (tip ring sleeve) or TS (tip sleeve) connections. This allows you to use both standard XLR microphones as well as direct input from guitar amps and other instruments. If possible, get phantom power/48 volt compatibility switches on both channels. Phantom power allows you to use condensor mics which require 48 volt power to travel back into the microphone. To be fair, you wont need this for either of the microphones I listed above as both the SM57 and 58 are dynamic mics which don't require power. Still, having phantom power allows you to use other condensor mics of potentially higher quality in the future if you want to upgrade.\u000a\u000aFor model recommendations, the Avid MBox and Focusrite Scarlett (2i2) series are both great options. These are the options I'm most familiar with and comfortable recommending so don't feel confined. In most cases, do some research on the features and stick to name brands and you should be fine.\u000a\u000aDAW recording software: (DAW stands for digital audio workspace.) Many times software will be included with your interface purchase. Avid, the makers of the MBox interface, also produce ProTools, one of the industry's most powerful recording softwares, so a lite version is sometimes included with your purchase. For newer users though really high powered software, such as ProTools and Logic, are not always ideal as they come with a learning curve. I know a couple people who use GarageBand and still come out with great recordings. Remember that your interface only allows you to play with what's already recorded. If you're having trouble, try manipulating the setup first. It's a lot harder to mix out bad recording artifacts than it is to move your microphone placement 2 inches. GarageBand and Reaper are both cheap and competent enough to get you by in most cases. If none of these suits your fancy, you can also try Ableton or Cubase.\u000a\u000aHope that's enough to get you started. As always, dig in with some research and don't be afraid to ask questions. Newbies are likely to get laughed at a couple times but it just comes with the trade. Don't feel bad for wanting to learn and always be looking for more information.\u000a\u000aGOOD LUCK!
p1802
aV Thanks man!  I don't even know how to respond to all this information! \u000a\u000aAre dynamic mics also good for speaking purposes? And are there small enough stands that will allow you to use them while sitting, less than a foot from you? 
p1803
aVI'd avoid a USB mic, but a shure PG58 is what I use and that more than gets the job done.
p1804
aVYou use any pod then? O.o
p1805
aVYou mean a preamp? yes but I don't know as much about them. I have an M-audio mobile-pre which gets the job done for home projects but I think the driver software is a little glitchy. It also came with a cleaned up version of Pro Tools that I hate vividly. It's extremely clunky and a resource hog and also glitches the fuck up on my either year old computer AND on my four month old gaming rig. I'll never understand why it's considered a standard.
p1806
aVWow. Maybe we should all switch to Ableton. XD
p1807
aVFocus rite makes inexpensive, reliable MIDI interfaces, like the Scarlett 2i2 and 2i4. I use the latter with a direct box for guitar and Logic Pro so I can build virtual walls of amplifiers. I have a cheap audiotechnica condenser mic for vocals, but listen to others' microphone recommendations on the score.  With the direct box you're looking at a normal quarter inch guitar cable and an XLR cable.
p1808
aVHow much are they? The interface? 
p1809
aVA common recommendation that gets thrown out around here is the Line 6 UX1, because it comes with the Pod Farm 2 modeling software. I use it, and despite having a now-defective unit it, it's a great little box for $150.
p1810
aVWhat makes it defective? 
p1811
aVI think the headphone jack came loose so I only get R and L output at certain spots on the knob. Too lazy to open and re-solder.
p1812
aVOh!  I misread this. I thought you were saying that the unit itself when you purchase it is defective. My bad. 
p1813
aVThe 2i2 goes for about $150, the 2i4 is a tad more, I think 180 or 190.
p1814
aVI'm looking at the 2i2 and it looks pretty good.   :)\u000a\u000aI'll be getting a Shure SM58 in like a week or two. Think that'll be alright for recording? 
p1815
aVDepending on what you want to use it for that should do fine. Both are high quality products that should hold up and allow you to do quite a bit. Remember, SM58 is great for vocals but the SM57 is the standard for instruments. If at all possible, I'd say get both. For a cheapish setup though having either is definitely great though.
p1816
aVCool. I don't think you hear of these mics used for podcasting often though? I plan on using mics for multiple purposes. Voice acting, live vocals, recording screaming/cleans. And I'll be using the interface for guitar work. Will the midi stuff work for the guitars or should I just try to get amplitube or guitarrig stuff? 
p1817
aVYou're right, the SM58 is generally not used for voice acting stuff. Most voice acting projects I've seen use large diaphragm condenser mics. The main reason for this, as I understand it, is that a condenser mic's inherent power gives it a little farther pickup range. This means that your source's (your mouth) proximity to the microphone won't necessarily affect the volume as much. Using the SM58 is probably fine for your purposes, but you'll likely have to get right up next to it to get the input level you'll want on your vocals.\u000a\u000aFor live singing vocals as well as musical studio recordings you shouldn't have any problems as singing often occurs at higher volumes (unless you're [Loud Howard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyCWOgu42w)).\u000a\u000aIf you're planning on using an in the box plugin for guitars then either interface should work fine. Just remember that your input volume will likely be significantly lower if you jack in straight from your guitar. Try switching between line level and mic level on the interface if you're not getting the volume you need.
p1818
aVI see. That makes sense. I think I'll probably just upgrade to that when I can for it.   :)\u000a\u000aAnd okay, is it normally that quiet? And XLR are just regular cables, right? 
p1819
aV[XLR are balanced cables you'll use for your microphone](http://homerecording.about.com/od/homestudiobasics/g/Balanced_cable.htm) they have a male and female end, the female end has three holes and the male end is sheathed and has three prongs.  The microphone takes the female end and the interface will take the male end.  The Scarlett uses the same input jack for the XLR and the 1/4" guitar cable.  For my setup, I have a guitar with a 1/4" guitar cable (what i think you're calling a 'regular' cable) go to a direct box which them goes to an XLR into the MIDI interface.  My microphone goes through an XLR into the MIDI interface.

asVTips for writing good death metal riffs?
p1831
(lp1832
VI dunno, you just... do. When you listen and play long enough you just become accustomed to what makes a tune good or not. I mean understanding scales and modulation helps but for the most part just getting good at jamming out rhythms and riffs and stuff is how it's done.
p1833
aVYeah, unfortunately there isn't really a science to it.\u000a\u000aI got into music and writing music because I"m a programmer by trade and I find art bizarrely foreign.  I've learned you just kind of roll with it and see.  I write a lot using TuxGuitar too -- it helps to create entire melodies/harmonies/etc.  Don't have much music theory background, so I'm almost entirely by ear/feel.\u000a\u000aAlso, just because the riff is a rip off doesn't mean it's unusable.  It's basically what most bands do now anyway. :-P
p1834
aVYour last point - it's what musicians have done since the dawn of music.
p1835
aVRiffs are not always intended to be melodic, but the same concepts that work for melody writing can be effectively applied to riff writing.\u000a\u000aEffective melodies are usually derived from very simple ideas that are repeated, either literally or with some sort of variation, and mixed with contrasting material into phrases with one of several forms: AAAB, ABAB, or ABAC. There are other possibilities of course, but that's usually what it boils down to. AAAB, for example, would be three repetitions of an idea (either literally or with small variations) and then something different. Often, phrases are arranged in such away that one phrase creates a "question" that is "answered" by the next phrase, but a lot of bands just dispense with that and have a lot of ABs in succession that don't vary or answer each other. \u000a\u000aNow take those principles and apply them to some of the standard tropes of death metal--dropped tunings (as /u/et5150's link pointed out, drop-C is very effective, but a lot of modern death metal is written using very heavy strings in drop-A), diminished and chromatic scales, palm muting, tremolo picking, and pinch harmonics--and you're in riff city. \u000a\u000aA lot of death metal bands abstract from this foundation considerably, but it's almost always in there somewhere. To get a better sense of the various tropes and idioms that death metal musicians employ, take some of your favorite riffs, write them out in whatever notational system you prefer, and analyze them, breaking them down, looking for repetition and variation, uncovering the underlying structures and patterns that makes the music work. \u000a\u000aIt may seem like a really heady, intellectual approach to a very primal and intuitive genre of music, but keep in mind that very few death metal musicians, or musicians in any genre, write melodies or riffs by sitting down and saying, "Okay, here's the first idea, and that's 'A', and now I'm going to repeat that three times, and then here's another idea, and thats 'B'..." What this process does is strengthen your musical intuition so you can write good riffs naturally and intuitively. 
p1836
aVYou should try to learn the songs you like. I might push you to copy too much in the beginning (like you said with MA), but it's a good way to learn how riffs are made and start making your own. Would be better to learn from many different bands, so your playing will be a mix and not a copy.
p1837
aVThere is no formula or magic scale, but I've found that one thing that helps me to spice up generic riffs and to get ourside the confines of my habitual box is to input the riff into guitar pro and to start screwing around with the timing to make it more unique. This is something I'm not always that great at instinctively so it's been a great help with breaking up the monotony of some songs or testing out things I can't get up to speed yet. 
p1838
aVThis might sound weird, but, listen to music backwards and try to play along. I have a looper pedal that will play a loop in reverse, so I learn a riff I like, then reverse it, and try to play it backwards.\u000a\u000aYou can get some good ideas that way.
p1839
aVTrying writing it on a computer or in your head first and then playing it. That way you don't accidentally write what your fingers already know.
p1840
aVThere are two ways to go about it, and I think its a matter of how comfortable you are with it. \u000a\u000aThere is the [Ron Jarzombek](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5SCH0Umbs) way. \u000a\u000aAnd there is the [modern / guitarpro](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2013/02/08/exclusive-guitar-pro-tablature-software-revealed-as-original-the-haarp-machine-member/) way to do it. \u000a\u000aThe second way is a easier, but first way will get you better results in my opinion.

It really sounds like you're practicing and grooving, noodling, not a song.  Also, you're not keeping time.  Try playing with some time keeping device, or patting your feet.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I think you made me listen to your practice session.  I don't know what that does for me or you or anyone.

asVMetal Pickup Recommendations?
p1880
(lp1881
VJB/Jazz is always a classic combo. Or the Nazgul/Sentient combo, they just released them in 6-string format, if you want something more modern.
p1882
aVI'd get a Nazgul based on the name alone.
p1883
aVI'm pretty tempted to for that reason alone.
p1884
aVOh, and if you want to minimize the work you need to replace the pups, the new EMG 57/66 set is damn near a passive when it comes to responsiveness. Excellent reviews, I'm putting them in my 7.
p1885
aVI absolutely love the JB/Jazz.  I've A/B'd it with EMG's during recording sessions and the JB sounds way more organic and crunchy.
p1886
aVLove the Nazgul in my 8. Sounds beast.
p1887
aVCrunchlabs, Pegasus', Invaders, Black Winters, Nazguls, Slugs, Distortions? Take your pick, all by Seymour Duncan! Bare Knuckle makes a few as well, I love the Juggernauts. And there's always EMG's, particularly the ALX HZ humbucker sounds awesome imo.
p1888
aVCan personally vouch for the crunchlabs. Really rich dark sound yet super clear. I've got a pair of illuminators in my main guitar now which the next sig pickups in the line, very nice and im loving them but I wouldn't say they are worth the extra $100 if you are going for just a metal sound.
p1889
aVYeah I can also vouch for the crunch lab, it's beast as fuck
p1890
aVIf we are going metal, I would say the Bareknuckle nailbomb, emerald, or even painkiller are all great.  They are better than the Juggernauts IMO.IT really depends on the wood of the guitar.  Brighter guitars: alnico magnet, draker: Cemeric.
p1891
aVI came here expecting to learn how to pickup girls, but in a metal way.  Mildly disappointed.
p1892
aVI can vouch for Distortion/59, JB/Jazz, and Pegasus/Sentient. Personally I dont like the Jazz at all, but I know some do. Distortion/59 is awesome for 6 strings, but 7+ I would go with Pegasus/Sentient.

VIf you're following Melissa, your technique is going to be thoroughly covered, so I'll cover the actual physical things that can effect your scream. Rule #1, same as Zombieland- CARDIO! This is HUGE, it's obvious how it would help, crunches help a lot too, having solid core is essential.. this us a big thing for me, I have shit allergies so, Every morning, completely clear out you're nasal cavities. Hacking loogies, blowing our your nose, over n over. You will probably puke early on. I do this in the shower, it's gross. You gotta quit smoking cigs, they'll construct your lungs and add to you're congestion. Hitting the bong I find most acceptable if you smoke weed, weed is ok. I like to have a drink before a show, ONE!! It's all personal, so if you find other things that help, WRITE THAT SHIT DOWN! If I think of something else I'll add below...
p1938
aVHe makes some good points, but some poor, if not necessary ones.  Cardio can help, although depending on your sound, may not be necessary.  A strong core is always handy, it will help you better than cardio, and will allow you to create more powerful sounds.  i don't do a lot of cardio, but can still hold +10s screams, growls, etc. the most important part of false chord vocals is air control.  Think about screaming as if your body was a cutting torch.\u000aYour abdomen is the tank. it's where the fuel comes from.  the stronger the tank, the higher the pressure, the bigger the flame.  the throat is the control knob. it can go as low as the lowest piq squeal (the brie brie thing) or glass shattering highs.  your mouth is the "flash hider" (i can't think of the name for the metal piece that the flame comes out of) it is used to give your "flame" the polish, the glow, and can be used in conjunction with your abdomen and throat to provide a plethora of different sounds, pitches, and tones.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf i ever get a chance to record some vocals, i'll try and explain what i'm doing.\u000a\u000aEDIT:  Congestion, weed, etc. dont' affect my vocals whatsoever.  When i perform, i prefer to be a little inebreated, as I get stage fright and the most important thing about false chord singing is being relaxed.  You should be "pushing" or forcing the sound, it should feel as nature as talking.  You don't push when you talk normally, or even shout, it seems to almost come by itself.  Remember to keep that in mind as you are learning.  It should feel natural, never artificial.
p1939
aVLol. Notice I attributed technique to his teacher and have for him a few pointers from a physical aspect that help me.  Now.... taking it as seriously as I do, and having worked as hard as I have, I don't suggest getting lazy and drunk and think that's going to help my stage presence or performance what so ever. The metaphor is dangerous. If you can't explain what you're doing, don't give tips. Each sound takes specific training and is different from the last. That being said, here's real tips.. GROWLING everything begins in your diaphragm, even better, your PC muscle if you're man enough. A real growler can go thru his whole day without letting his core loose... I grown from the pit of my stomach and use my tongue and mouth positioning to change from the roar to the guttural. Roar mouth open, tongue down, breathe fire motherfucker. If it hurts your throat, don't get used to it, do it right! Get your belly tight! Guttural, I'll manipulate my lips &amp; tongue, watch Phillybo from Whitechapel on YouTube. It's perfect. High screams and fry's you can go 2 different ways. Clear your nasal learn to fry and do it right OR scream from the derivative of 'talking like a little girl' which it makes no difference if you're congested or drunk. But you're going to hurt yourself that way, easy if you're on tour instead of playing 2x a week. Just like the drums I play, there's so many cheap shortcuts in metal it's a joke. If you take it seriously and wanna go somewhere, you'll learn to do it right.
p1940
aVPC muscle? really? i've never tried bringing it from that far down. definitely something i should try out.  being drunk doesn't make you lazy, it's just something I do when I perform in order to take the edge of my nerves.  it doesn't affect performance, if anything, it improves the "show" as I feel more into it and don't stand around as much.
p1941

asVWhat's a good guitar for playing metal leads and solos? [X-post /r/metalguitar]
p1950
(lp1951
VPicking out a guitar is very subjective. We dont know what tone you're looking for, whether or not you prefer a specific neck, or if you like floating bridges and what not.\u000a\u000aAll I can say is find out what your favorite bands/artists are using, go to a guitar center and test out that list of guitars and find one that is both comfortable to play and sounds great. 
p1952
aVIbanez RG series
p1953
aVThis is usually a safe bet.\u000a\u000aFor more refined advice I'd listen to anything this guy has to say:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6liq9e0_eg4
p1954
aVHe definitely knows his shit. Except when it comes to background loops for videos
p1955
aVI don't think you need a new guitar unless you really don't feel comfortable with yours. Even then, you can get a new neck or make adjustments.\u000a\u000aIf it's sound you're looking for, maybe get some new pickups like Humbuckler.
p1956
aVTo be fair, getting a good set of pickups would cost more than the guitar itself.
p1957
aVGood pickups can make any guitar sound better.
p1958
aVYou can also get some wicked decent pickups for half your price..
p1959
aVI'm sure this will get downvoted but it's not the guitar, it's you. You should be able to pick up any $100 POS and make it sound great. It's not an insult to you. If it's a $3000 custom PRS or a $300 Schecter, if you play the shit out of it, it won't matter if the "tone" isn't good.
p1960
aVWell, there's something to be said about how well you play having an effect on how well the guitar breathes, how sweet the vibrato is, and how smooth and full transitions between notes are. But that doesn't mean tone isn't different between guitars, nor does it mean that some or more flexible than others or designed better for other things. There is in fact a difference between a 100 dollar guitar and a 900 dollar guitar.
p1961
aVI agree there is a difference, but to the layman, whom you would most likely be entertaining, can't tell the difference.\u000a\u000aThere's a difference between a $10,000 bottle of wine, and a box of Franzia, but they get you the same drunk. 
p1962
aVI don't agree. Maybe between a $400 guitar and a $1000 guitar, but even before I played guitar just browsing for something that fit comfortably in my arms at GC with a friend I could tell the difference between a PoS and even a decent guitar.
p1963
aVThat's actually a good analogy
p1964
aVLeads and Solos you want a thin neck and probably at least 22 frets, preferrably 24. Jacksons are nice. ESP is also a good option. However, for your price range, you're not gonna get the real Seymour Duncans, but the Duncan Designed knockoffs at best. \u000a\u000a[This Dinky is $450](http://www.guitarcenter.com/Jackson-DKXT-Dinky-Electric-Guitar-107470494-i2079602.gc), with decent EMG's (or maybe the worst, I don't know about active pickups), obviously you might be able to get a better price somewhere other than Guitar Center but they list all the specs.
p1965
aVThose are passive EMG-HZ pickups, their cheap option basically. They're not bad but they're not close to their actives, which I'm not so sure I like anymore anyway.
p1966
aVJackson or ESP LTD.\u000a\u000aIbanez are good too.
p1967
aVJust so you know $400 is not going to get you a pro-level guitar. For that price I'd recommend a mid-range LTD or an Ibanez S or RG. Other options you might want to check out are PRS SE, Jackson, or even an Epiphone if you're into that. Just go to a guitar center and try everything you can in your price range; personal preference varies a lot.

In which case, i'd connect directly into your pc and record, assuming your pc specs are decent and are running low latency drivers like ASIO.\u000a\u000aProgram wise, [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/) allows for unlimited trial, but asks that you buy the product every time you load up. Give this a try, and afterwards, if you really like the product, you should definitely buy the license. It's only $60, way cheaper than most professional products, and considering that the developers are nice enough to essentially make the software free, the least you could do is show some support.

aVThe ORE FM app will use the listeners GPS location to play music by bands in a set range selected by the user. If there are no bands in that area, it will find something in the next closest range to play. Listeners will also be able to scan the globe for bands and listen to music from any area as well. We plan on having a large social network push as well as promoting by holding metal shows in larger cities and towns. We also have some other ideas in mind but I can't give away all our secrets. ;)

sVVocals FX/Mixing Help...
p1993
(lp1994
VFirstly I would add EQ and try and clean the vocal up a bit - take out bass frequencies, DeEss it, etc. Other commenters have discussed that though.\u000a\u000aI find slight reverb is a great way to have a vocal sit in a mix better. Set up a stereo aux track and put a reverb on it. I usually keep it at 100% wet. Create a send from the vocal track to the reverb. Not a bus - a send! Now solo the reverb track and the vocal track, and on the vocal track, change how much input is going to the send (reverb) until it feels good to you. Doing this mixes the reverb with the dry signal until it sounds the best.\u000a\u000aThen test it in the mix, and try and get it to sit right. The more reverb that is added, the more 'distant' the vocal will feel - the dryer it is, the more 'upfront'. Play around with it until it works! 
p1995
aV[deleted]
p1996
aVAs /u/microbe_fvcker pointed out, it's hard to give any targeted advice without hearing what you have so far.\u000a\u000aHow familiar are you with actual mixing techniques? Having some knowledge of good techniques will likely be the biggest help. In a nutshell, I generally only cut - as a rule. You want to make sure every instrument has a clear path for it's own sound, wherever the most defining frequency for that instrument is.\u000a\u000aIn the case of vocals, I would recommend taking and soloing the track and using a good multiband EQ plugin to zero out the track across the band. Then start and create a spike that you can sweep across the entire bandwidth range to find where the "sweet spot" is for the vocals - this will let you know where the other instruments need to have a sharp dip in them for the vocals to sit *in* the mix. They can then be heard without overpowering everything else volume-wise.\u000a
p1997
aVAnother tip that always gets glossed over is make sure your delay and reverb sends are high passed enough so you don't get mud. 9/10 people forget to do this and wonder why their mix is getting muddy after adding effects.
p1998
aVCan't tell you what you're doing wrong if you don't post a clip.\u000a\u000aMy somewhat simplified chain for mixing vocals below. Don't follow this to the point, mess with it yourself. Also check both soloed first then in the mix.\u000a\u000a(Lines in **bold** are for growl/scream vocals)\u000a\u000a* De-ess\u000a* **Compress to fuck** (compress 'normally')\u000a* High-pass/Low-cut filter\u000a* Search and destroy-type EQ cuts (usually just some mud around 200-500hz)\u000a* Hi-shelf @ maybe 8khz to pump some air back in to it\u000a* Add **liberal amounts of** reverb/delay. Sometimes you only need reverb.\u000a\u000aAgain this sounds like a recipe, and it is, for *my* style of mixing. But I think if you get the compression and EQ right + a touch of reverb, you're golden.
p1999
aVMight be a mixing issue, or something completely different. It's hard to give advice w/o hearing a sample of what you have.

asVCritique/advise me on my songs! Recordings inside.
p2001
(lp2002
VYour playing is solid, so nothing really a problem there. For "Qualify for Survival", the song definitely needs to be double tracked for guitar and have a bass thrown in. The same could go for "Rabbithole", as one guitar playing all parts sounds very empty. There are points where, when you're tapping lower strings, the reverb effects are overbearingly boomy over what you are playing, and then when you play higher strings, its almost empty and silent. I would, again, double track to get a stereo mix, then separate dry guitar tracks from the effects in order to get consistent levels on what's played while controlling the wet signal when it overbears. As a cherry on top, you could add synths and shit to make it even more spacey.
p2003
aVSo, by double tracking, do you mean record two tracks separately, or arm two tracks to record at once? That would give me two identical tracks for a stereo mix.\u000a\u000aI get what you mean about the reverb, I'm new to effects, digital amp modelling etc and was just messing about with it. Previously I've only played direct through the amp!\u000a\u000aAlso, I don't have a bass, but I could track a bass with a 6 string and shift the pitch down for now. I'm pretty sure I can also use a synth effect on guitar, unless Reaper has built in instruments etc like some DAWs, I haven't really experimented with it much yet.\u000a\u000aThanks for the feedback, really appreciate it :)
p2004
aVYou'll be recording two seperate tracks when double tracking. Duplicating a single track and panning them hard left and right would just give you a louder center track.\u000a\u000aIf need be, you could ask around here or some other subreddit if you need someone to lay down bass. Pitch shifting a guitar is good for having an idea to work with, but it won't sound good enough keep in the mix.
p2005
aVSo play the same riff twice, on two tracks, rather than arm one track and play it once whilst recording to both tracks?
p2006
aVCorrect. [Check out this link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1064562/Mixing/rythmguitars_test_1copypasted_2copypasted-nudged_3doubletracked.mp3) that u/ensi posted a while ago. The first part is two of the same tracks panned hard left and right, which just gives you mono track in the center. The second is the same, except one track is slightly shifted a few milliseconds, causing the tracks to be out of phase. You now have a stereo track with space in the center to put instruments like bass, however the phase issue cause some frequency cancellations and can sound hollow and distracting. The final part is two separate guitar tracks recorded as perfectly the same as possible, giving a fuller sound while still maintaining stereo.\u000aThere are some instances where you may decide to still stick with one guitar track. Usually this means you pan to one side while panning the bass to the opposite. I don't have any metal bands at the top of my head that do this, but i do know that bands like the Beatles and Red Hot Chili Peppers use this technique in lieu of having only one guitarist.

p2010
aVNo problem, test it yourself, it makes a big difference.  Pretty much every album you hear, the guitar is layered at least twice.

VYou're a bit off at times, like with a few of the drops and stops and stuff (iconic Gojira technique). And your tone is a bit too thin for Gojira, not enough "boom" coming from those punches. And the end sounded a bit silly because of how staccato you were hitting those points. I think you were muting the whole note altogether when in the actually song you palm mute the note but let that palm mute ring. I could record an example if you'd like.\u000a\u000aAside from that, I was impressed! Especially with the vocals. Not many people can pull a Joe Duplantier but you definitely can pull it off if you stick to it. \u000a\u000aBonus points if you learned this song by ear. That's how I did it. It's actually a very easy song to learn by ear. I meant to cover it a long time ago but you beat me to it! So I'm gonna maybe do Liquid Fire... Maybe Space Time. Or Explosia. \u000a\u000aOverall, 7/10. Great effort and I could tell you really thought out what you were doing.

aVThanks for the feedback. The tone I usually record with is much more punchier, but I tried to emulate the Gojira tone (and failed). If you could record an example that would be very helpful. I will probably re record it at some point and tighten it up etc.\u000aAlso I learned the song from guitar pro mostly, I didn't play along to the actual song. I should probably do that.
p2019
aVPlaying along to the track itself will definitely help! Lol. That way you'll really feel the timings and rhythms with the feel they created. Guitar pro can only do so much lol. I think it's a great tool for transposing but I don't take it too far beyond that. \u000a\u000aYeah man I'll fiddle around with my guitar and record some examples.

p2057

VGet a battle jacket it instantly makes you better at thrash metal.

p2060
aVDone!
p2061
aVAlso chug a few beers.
p2062
aVGet comfortable palm muting most passages, while lifting for a few accented notes. Also, alternate picking is a must. For a melodic sound, stay in minor keys. For the more aggressive sound, you need to use more dissonant scales, such as Phrygian or octatonic, but don't be afraid to make power chords based off notes in these scales even if they don't fit.
p2063
aVThanks, I will learn/attempt to learn some of that.
p2064
aVI've been playing guitar for 15 odd years and studied music theory in college. I've never heard of octatonic. \u000a\u000a
p2065
aVIt's also called a diminished scale. It alternates between whole and half steps.
p2066
aVAhh okay, thanks. :)
p2067
aVWhole-half or half-whole alternates as such. Diminished is a step and a half (3 frets) between each interval. It's fun to play the diminished runs that occur in other scales, such as harmonic minor.
p2068
aVHalf step down. Get your picking hand used to doing some intense down picking (Hetfield is a fucking god at this) 
p2069
aVBeen practicing down picking a while, I'm alright, but not like Jaymz.
p2070
aVPractice everyday. Even if it's only for 5 minutes.
p2071
aVI might be able to give you a few tips. I've only been playing guitar for about a year and a half (started at the ripe age of 26), but thrash/crossover are what I practice/play/write; pretty much the reason I started playing in the first place.\u000a\u000aA good way to understand thrash and speed metal is to download some of the tablature and use guitar pro to slow down the bpm. As mentioned by others in here, alternate picking and down picking are both important. The challenge is more in figuring out when to use them, which comes in time and as you get more comfortable with the riff styles of thrash.\u000a\u000aA real good start, also would be to check out some Power Metal, like Iron Maiden, etc. because it's more often than not slower than the 200+bpm crossover genre.\u000a\u000aAll that being said, here are a few tips:\u000a\u000a* Almost all thrash/crossover is played in E-standard tuning. Some guitarists might tune down half a step to Eb standard to make themselves pop out a bit more from the rest of the band, but for the most part E standard is where it's at (Ninja Edit: Except for [Vektor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZeltyIhaw0), who plays in F-standard and they are incredible).\u000a\u000a* Spend just as much time on your picking hand technique and rhythm as you do on fretboard logic/theory. In Thrash, there really isn't a lot of notes that ring out beyond a quarter note more than once or twice in a row, simply because much of what thrash contains is guitars that play every beat of the rhythm in the band, which is actually much different than the majority of other music in the world in which guitar is almost an accent to the rest of the band. This leads into my next point.\u000a\u000a* Rhythm is much more important than a slew of notes all over the neck when you're learning how to play thrash/speed metal. If you look back at old Exodus or Testament, some of their greatest riffs were astonishingly simple but have the fucking *groove* to it. Just a reminder: Rhythm is severely important, so get used to just playing to a metronome or backing track, all eighth notes for a few measures, all 16th notes the next couple measures, then 32nd notes, then 16th notes, and then back to eighths. Practice that type of rhythm exercise and put in a few notes here and there. This all goes toward establishing an internal metronome for yourself and it's tremendously rewarding when you start to enjoy the rhythms you come up with.\u000a\u000a* Toxic Holocaust is a great band and they are a great example of something that I am still very much working on which is: String skipping; being able to play rhythm whilst interweaving single notes, hammer-ons/pull-offs, from other strings right in the middle of your low E rhythm chugging. It provides accent outside of the groove that you are running on the low string(s).\u000a\u000a* Learning a few scales is important - as already mentioned - but don't get stuck in them. Minor/Harmonic Minor scales are used quite frequently, but there is an abundance of chromatic note sequences throughout thrash (if you're not familiar, chromatic meaning does not fit within a convention western scale). It's fucking awesome and can make for some incredibly unique riffs.\u000a\u000a* Last but definitely not least: Power Chords. You already know power chords are used, but what needs to be established is that there are a tremendous amount of power chord slides, palm muted power chords, single low-E notes amidst quick power chord shift on other strings. Get very familiar with the feeling of a power chord, use that as the basis to explore altered power chords, like those with raised 5ths, etc.\u000a\u000aI am by no means pretending to be an expert. I have so much to learn, just like you. I just got a bit of a head start. Hopefully some of this helps.\u000a\u000aHere are some other resources for you:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYT3GUjozKI\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EW-JZOcULA\u000a\u000aGood luck and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

aVStart slow with riffs and practice tricky parts at half speed. Only increase speed when you nail the lick.

p2076
aVI have heard that 4th chords can give the illusion of a lower tuning or just be a bit thicker when you need it. Otherwise, scoop your mids and cut a little bass, get that really good shitty distorted sound, and alternate pick some power chords.

p2083
aVA few simple rules of thumb... pull all the low end out of your guitars. *All of it*. Too much compression sounds like ass. Louder isn't always better.  A bit of reverb can save the day, or ruin a recording. Use it sparingly.  Recordings tend to use *less* distortion that you would use if playing live. Take that into consideration while adjusting your guitar tones. Pan your guitar tracks, with leads up the middle. Never pan snares and kicks, but feel free to play around with toms and cymbals. 
p2084
aVAre these more tips for mastering or for mixing? All this stuff is what I'd do for mixing, but I didn't know I they were also incorporated into mastering. 
p2085
aVIt's pretty much just mixing.  Maybe OP was confused at the difference and meant mixing?
p2086
aVlol what a truckload of good information. Especially on the distortion and tones, good call.\u000a\u000aI would like to add some stuff though, mostly that you can get away with having a little low end in your tones if you're quad tracking with two thin high shelves, or if your bass tone is frail or weak (and you want it that way.) Also, panning all of your drums is a more abstract thing to do but [it can totally be done successfully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16NaOFTIkug).
p2087
aV&gt; done successfully\u000a\u000aI'm afraid we have very different definitions of success. The recording would be better with centre panned drums, in my opinion. 
p2088
aVNah man, when you have headphones on and the bass is in one ear and the drums are in another its mind blowing. Totally accentuates the jam feeling.\u000a\u000a[There's an old Candlemass album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdVIx8GOLco) where the kick and snare are off center, but not completely left or right. They're on opposite sides, and it adds to the spaciness of it. It's not the kind of thing you would notice though, unless you took one earbud out and listened for it, but I studied this album a bit when I went to go do mixing on my own. Yeah, for headbangable stuff it's usually a good idea to throw them in the center, but again there are enough good examples of the contrary where you can do move them around *with caution*.
p2089
aVNow obviously I don't pan all the way, but I usually offset the snare to the left a few clicks. Any reason why I shouldn't do this?
p2090
aVIt sounds like ass 99% of the time, that's why.
p2091
aV[This video shows you basically everything you need to know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgr8nHCSOMs) Ozone is fan-goddamn-tastic. It's especially neat if you use the match EQ function to match to a well-produced album. I did that with a Devildriver song and it sounds like sex IMHO. But as with anything, and not just the match eq, be incredibly sparing and tasteful or it will come out sounding awful haha.

aVI did a two man drum and bass doom thing for a little, sounded great. and that's why I'm in this pickle, I still want my doom bass wall of amp, because I'll only be in this band for a max of two years before college, and I'd probably switch back to bass, in which I will carry on with a 215 and 410, but it'd be nice toknow if I could get a good guitar tone out of one and save having to buy another cab (but if it does come to it I will)

p2102
(lp2103
sVI really want to step up the quality of my recordings. Would appreciate some advice.
p2104
(lp2105
VThat interface would definitely work well for DI recording in a home studio. When considering an interface, you want to look into how many input/outputs you'll need, quality of preamps (does it break/distort), any extra features desired (level monitoring, usb 1/2/3 or firewire, xlr input, ect.), and reliability of brand. I'll assume the only recording you do is guitar/bass while leaving drums to a program, the forcusrite has more than enough channels for that. It also leaves the option of using a mic if you choose to down the road. \u000a\u000a[Here's a video of the guitarist of Periphery using the same interface](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er9VhozNHNk), except he's using Axe FX to get his tone. In your case you can either continue using the headphone jack of your amp (redundant), or as you suggested, just use VSTs.
p2106
aVThanks! I actually remember seeing that video a while back and it was one of the reasons me wanting me to step up the quality!\u000a\u000aWhen you say you "you can either continue using the headphone jack of your amp", do you mean plug that into the interface, and the interface into the computer? Would that make a difference compared to what I am doing now?\u000a\u000aAlso, what VSTs are recommended? I have only used a couple of free ones. \u000a\u000aAnd I like this interface because it has options for MIDI too, which I have dabbled with using my piano/keyboard.
p2107
aVNot really, although I suppose it may depend on the quality of your mobile device or sound card. Most people need pre-amps simply because going straight into the computer from an amp jack leaves an incredibly inaudible signal.\u000a\u000aListening to your song I can tell you that picking a different fuzz, EQing, and mastering are going to make the biggest different. Yeah, fancy DAW's that let you add frequency response patches will help add some of that fiece attack to your tone, but if you don't feel like pirating or paying tons of money for a cramped and resource heavy DAW, start by cutting the mids on your pre-production tone (on your amp) to give it some more bounciness, and high shelf one of the guitars on your recording to help distinguish the guitar from the bass. Then cut out most of the unused frequencies on your bass, cymbals, kick, and snare drum, and the you'll be able to increase the volume of all of the above while keeping the clarity of all of them.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, don't record super hot. I know a lot of people say turn the volume up to as high as it will go without clipping, in order to increase the volume to background hum ratio, but having some headroom in your bare guitar tracks is nice, so that in the event you want to boost a frequency, raise the volume of something, or just add harshness or dirt, you won't run into any problems.\u000a\u000aSong was good too
p2108
aVThanks for the comment!\u000a\u000aI find that when I turn down the mids down too much on my amp, it just starts to sound kind of tinny and low(er) quality. \u000a\u000aWhat does 'shelf' one of the guitars mean? In fact, I'm not sure what "cut out most of the unused frequencies on your bass, cymbals, kick, and snare drum" means either, could you please explain it?Sorry, I'm such a noob when it comes to recording. My recording setup is so barebones and I don't ever really mess with anything afterwards, so it's all really foreign to me.\u000a\u000aAnd thanks for the compliment, glad you liked the song! :)
p2109
aVWell there are no exact ways to do it but basically a high shelf is when you EQ out all the low frequencies to give one of the guitars a grainier higher tone. On it's own it sounds like shit, but when you play it simultaneously with one or a few other tracks , it richens up the sound. Do that to either your left or right tracks. Adding a third track with different distortion can also fatten up the sound if you're feeling lazy and don't want to record a piece four times (Entombed did this on their first album. The L and R tracks go through HM-2's and a third Center track is a DS or something.)\u000a\u000aCymbals are high frequency percussion instruments. So if you cut everything below 5000ish, you'll reduce the volume of the lower frequencies that just take up space and let the distortion and bass fill that in. For your bass you should also greatly reduce all of the frequencies above a certain point, but that really depends on how grungy you want your bass to sound.\u000a\u000aUltimately, the EQ tool is going to be one of your best assets when shaping the tone of your music.
p2110
aVI really wish I understood EQing better. I always hear people talk about it but I don't really understand it that well. The only thing I ever do with EQ is either increase the mids or decrease the mids, depending on what I want. But I don't really know anything else other than that. \u000a\u000aThe two songs linked in the OP were actually tracked 4 times for just the rhythm parts. But it's the same tone all 4 times. Two of the tracks were lower volume, though.
p2111
aVYeah, don't be afraid to use different amps/settings for different tracks.\u000a\u000aHonestly, you're going to have to got through a few shitty recordings until you get what you want. It's something you'll pick up over time and then get the hang of. There are lots of tutorials on tracking and high shelves and EQ in general on youtube though. One thing I've learned is that if you're going to make a cut, make it a big cut. Drop the frequencies you want out by like 20-30 decibels, and if that sounds too dead then lighten up on it from there. Don't just make some asinine wavy thing in the EQ chart with a few bumps. Only do that as like the very last step for minor tweaks when you've done everything else. Granted, I'm an amature, so if someone wants to correct me they can, but these seem to be good rules for me.
p2112
aVThe EQ that's shown in this video should give you a good idea of what to do for metal EQ (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6PHzkPjH7c). And for good EQ tools, you don't need Cubase or even Pro Tools. Any existing (Windows) DAW you have should be good as long as you have this plugin: http://www.vst4free.com/free_vst.php?id=478. Or if you want a free DAW, try LMMS. But the gist of is that you should look at the EQ settings the guy in the video used in his tracks, and mimic them in the plugin I just linked you to.

p2130
aVHave you ever seen American Idol auditions? People are not good at judging themselves. People are even worse at admitting they are shit at something they've dedicated time to. This will never work. He will think it sounds fine; just like he currently thinks it sounds fine. 
p2131
aVThat's... That actually would work I bet, when he finally hears it for himself outside of all the noise while jamming he'll finally see what I mean. Thanks!
p2132
aVAnother thing you can do: Blend his performance with quantatized drum samples, and use that, so you have his playing, reinforced by samples from a better kit.
p2133
aVAnd I forgot to mention the sad part of this was that his kit was a nice sized one: Three different sized crashes, two different sized splashes, three mounted toms and a floor tom, a 22' ride, hi hats, and two bass drums.
p2134
aVWhat sort of kit did he have, and what do you expect him to replace it with? A good drum kit is expensive, can easily rack up to the same cost as a custom-built guitar, unless you want to opt for a smaller kit or for a worse built kit.\u000a\u000aCan you give a list of what shells are at least less-than-partially damaged? What cymbals are not destroyed?
p2135
aVAlso if he knows who did it and has evidence,he can sue for destruction if private property
p2136
aVHe actually didn't even care that much when it happened. He even knows exactly who did it.
p2137
aVJust playing devils advocate, and I hope I'm wrong, but maybe he's using this an excuse to quit.  
p2138
aVNo he does genuinely love playing music and now he says its his last chance because he says he's going to join the air force to set his life straight unless we manage to get signed to a label in two months but he wants me to do a whole demo from scratch in two weeks.
p2139
aVWhat does he think getting signed to a label is going to change in his life? Especially in the state of today's music industry? While there are exceptions, If you guys think there is magically a pile of money thrown at you, you are going to be greatly disappointed. Being on a label gives you access to distribution and marketing, as well as potential gigs with labelmates, if you are lucky. In the old days, the label would front the money for recording and production costs and recoup it from royalties and other revenue streams, These days, with the ability to get professional quality on a lower budget, they often expect you to present them with a finished product you've funded on your own. Regardless, until you hit stratospheric record sales, any money to be made comes from your live performances. \u000a\u000aEven after being signed, the reality is most musicians still have to work a day job to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. And this is not something new, this has always been this way. This is especially true in metal. Did you ever say to yourself "Why isn't my [favorite band] coming to my city" or "Why are they only doing 12 shows?" The answer is they have to coordinate the time out of their day-to-day lives, front a certain amount of money for travel prep and schedule the shows with as little downtime as possible so at the very least they don't lose money by going on the road.\u000a\u000aWhile I'm not saying it can't happen, the two month window is an extremely unrealistic expectation with no obvious benefit beyond personal satisfaction. In the end it isn't a miracle cure for what is affecting your drummer.\u000a\u000aSource: I worked in virtually all aspects of the music industry - performer, manager, producer, roadie, tech, etc.
p2140
aVOh I know I won't be rich if I choose music as my occupation and I already knew most of what you said. I told him if by some divine miracle we were to get signed we'd have to have our songs down like the back of our hands and he hasn't even listened to any of the material and actually told me to rewrite all of it without even hearing any of it. I try and tell him this takes serious work, I personally love the challenge, but he says all the time not to worry because we can just "do it" and our music will be good. While I have faith we have the potential to be very good musicians, music just isn't like that.
p2141
aVIn all honesty, this arrangement sounds futile, and draining. It's incredibly difficult, but I've had to pull out of an 8-year project with a good friend because despite the strength of the material, it became clear that he did not have realistic goals or expectations, and was basically undermining our progress by not getting real. It's better to be serious about music first, and friends second, from my experience. YMMV.
p2142
aVAgain, not trying to be a dick, but those are some pretty rigid boundaries being imposed on any success. 
p2143
aVYeah I know, he sets himself up to fail.
p2144
aVWow. Dude, run.\u000a\u000aUse EZDrummer with Metal foundry for the demo. You need a literal miracle for a record deal, and if your drummer goes off right after you're getting contacted, you're fucked. Rather be straight with it and say you don't have a drummer than risk entering a record deal you can't fulfill.
p2145
aVHow fucked are the shells and rims?  If the damage is mostly cosmetic, and the rims aren't too bent to hold a tuning it might not be insurmountable.  
p2146
aVThey're pretty bent up in some spots, he lost all 16 of his tuning keys too
p2147
aVIf you can still stand to play with him, maybe just look into replacing the rims and heads.    If they hold a tuning you should be fine, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper than buying a whole new kit.  
p2148
aVAnytime a band mate has told me that I *need* to do something regarding my gear, I've never been inclined to listen.  I *need* to turn down the gain?  Well guess what!  The HM-2 is going up to 11!  I *need* to start playing solos?  Well too bad because the top two strings are coming off my guitar!  I *need* to move around more on stage?  I'm playing the next show sitting down!  Now on the other hand, if they *ask* me and are willing to have a conversation instead of just barking orders at me, then I'll probably listen and reach a compromise.
p2149
aVOh I only told him he needs to do those things because he told me, and I've written his drum parts and my guitar parts and baisically the bass parts too, that I need to rewrite and record our demo (he said it was to hard to work with, yeah he can only play to chug riffs and constant power chords) in two weeks otherwise he's giving up on music, actually he said he wants to do the whole demo in one night so if he doesn't do those things then he can leave the band. I gave him the option of programmed drums until his kit is back up to speed but he refuses and I want this demo to get us attention, possibly sign us with a label if we work hard enough on it, at least I know I have.

aVI can do black metal vocal fries and death growls and for these distorted styles you do want to build a bit of mucus by warming up before doing something like performing or recording because it smooths out the sound. You only need a bit so keeping hydrated is important. Some drink milk, others drink beer, I don't know about that.\u000a\u000aI do know that hardcore screams and Slayer-esque shout singing are the most difficult vocal styles to control and master.

VWhat are you settings on the 808 and amp model?\u000a\u000aSounds like you could do with backing off the the gain a bit taming the bass and treble.
p2175
aVI turned down the gain on both the 808 and the 8505 and it didn't make much of a difference, unless I turned the gain on the 8505 to almost 0.\u000a
p2176
aVWhat are you settings on the 808 and amp model?
p2177
aVMy 808 settings are Drive, Tone, and Volume at max. My 8085 settings are:\u000aGain: Max\u000aLow: Max\u000aMid: 3.5\u000aSweep: Max\u000aHigh: 5\u000aPower Amp: Max\u000aVolume: 7\u000a
p2178
aVTry turning the drive on your 808 all the way down and just boost the volume. You want the 808 to be pushing the amp it's going into, in order to thicken out the amps sound, rather than adding gain from the 808 itself. When you see guitarists using a boost before the amp, it's not to add gain, but to push the signal into the amp harder, therefore making the amp sound fatter, not to further distort the signal. I personally have my EQ as bass: 11 o'clock, mid: 12 o'clock, treble: 2 o'clock and the gain around 2/3 o'clock, but then using my boost pedal to push it harder. It means you get a heavier thicker tone, but not by adding more gain, which will make your tone less defined. Maybe take down the bass down to around 2/3 o'clock if you still want that mid scooped tone.
p2179
aVThis advice on the 808 (having gain at zero) and these EQ settings are exactly what I came to say. The only thing I'd add is that when mixing, use a Low-Pass Filter to get rid of some of that fizziness (I usually set mine anywhere from 9k up to 14k, depending on the sound). \u000a\u000a\u000aExperimenting with different Cab IRs can also help.  
p2180
aVGreat minds think alike. Yeah regarding EQing within a mix, I tend to cut my guitars at around 100/150Hz at the bottom, and anywhere between the range that you mentioned at the top. Of course this all depends on the guitar tone.
p2181
aVPersonally I'd add some mids and dial back the gain. You normally use much less gain when recording and you'll need the mids to cut through in a mix.\u000a\u000aYou've currently got your boost and your gain all the way up, so there's quite a lot there. The last recording I did was with a TS-9 everything 12 o'clock and then the amp gain also on 12. Came out plenty heavy, but you might need to double the guitar tracks. 
p2182
aVWaaaaay too much gain.
p2183
aVThanks a lot for the help guys. I made some changes based on all of your tips, so see if you think it's any better. https://soundcloud.com/haaris-sohail/thrash-metal-tone-test-v2\u000a\u000aAnd these are my settings. http://postimg.org/gallery/3kaebw66/e27afb2d/\u000a\u000aI also double-tracked this time, and added a Low Shelf Filter to one track, and a High SHelf Filter to another, since the hi-pass/low-pass thing wasn't working well in Garageband.
p2184
aVI wasn't able to listen on decent speakers, but it definitely sounded better from what I could hear. A lot clearer an more defined. Judging from the image of your settings, I think it would still be worth taking down the bass, especially if its going to be sitting amongst other instruments within a mix.
p2185
aVWhen you say 'bass', do you mean the 'low' setting on the 8505?
p2186
aVYeah man. Also, something else to mess around with: the tone knob on the 808 is set so at the left, the sound is a bit bassier, and at the right, it's more trebly. It might be worth fiddling around with that, in order to see what sounds best 
p2187
aVCool. So are you suggesting that on one track, I should have the tone 1/4 to max, and 3/4 to max on the other?
p2188
aVHave it at whatever sounds best. Don't just turn it up because you can. There is no right or wrong as to what the 2 different tracks have in comparison. I'd personally just keep the settings on the 808 the same for both tracks. Maybe just fiddle with the amp settings so they're slightly different on each track.

p2197
asVWhat makes this guitar part so compelling?
p2198
(lp2199
VOk, there are a few things going on here that make this riff great. \u000a\u000aFirst of all, let's talk about the scale. This particular riff is in the diminished octatonic scale. What's special about this scale is that it has eight notes, whereas most scales in the Western chromatic system have seven. The diminished octatonic is also one of those scales which, by association, tends to make us in the Western hemisphere think of exotic Eastern imagery, sort of a Lawrence of Arabia feel. It's also very common in Flamenco, and Spain was under Arab occupation for something like ~800 years, leading to considerable overlap in culture and music. \u000a\u000aNow let's talk about motion. This scale has four notes. When I play it on my guitar, which is tuned to D Standard, it looks like this:\u000a\u000aD------------------------------------------  \u000aA------------------------------------------  \u000aF------------------------------------------  \u000aC------------------------------------------  \u000aG------------------------------------------  \u000aD--4--3--1----3--0----0--1--3--4-------  \u000a\u000aAccording to the scale we're within, each of these notes are adjacent to one another, except for the transition 3--0. In music theory, we call this a smooth contour. That is, we don't really have notes that are making huge leaps to wildly different pitches. Smooth contour=simplicity, and for many, simplicity=compelling.  \u000a\u000aNow about harmony. This riff features power chords, which most consider to be a cornerstone element of metal guitar. A power chord, at its most basic, is a when a given note is played simultaneously with a [Perfect Fifth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4Ah37OU9ps) Often, power chords are played in parallel perfect fifths, which means that for every note on the fretboard I move up or down, my finger that stops the fifth retains the exact same position relative to the root. This riff features a parallel perfect fifth, which, when added to the initial root riff, looks like this:  \u000a\u000aD------------------------------------------  \u000aA------------------------------------------  \u000aF------------------------------------------  \u000aC------------------------------------------  \u000aG--6--5--3----5--2----2--3--5--6-------   \u000aD--4--3--1----3--0----0--1--3--4-------  \u000a\u000aHowever, there's a tricky little thing about parallel perfect fifths, and that's that it's really easy for them to sound like shit. The modern Western ear usually prefers that harmonies conform to the denoted scale. In Western scales, *e.g* the Major and natural minor scales, it's literally impossible to play parallel perfect fifths that remain in the scale. At the 4th scale degree, of the major scale (or the second scale degree of the minor scale), a parallel perfect fifth goes sharp, breaking scale conformity. Coming full circle back to the initial paragraph about the current scale we're in, here's another thing that makes this riff special: there ARE certain scales in which parallel perfect fifths remain diatonic and scale-conforming.  \u000aYou might recognize the Byzantine scale (sometimes called the Arabian, Jewish, Symmetrical, or Double Harmonic Minor Scale) from virtually any black metal song, or from bands like Nile. Nile will also often use the Hungarian Minor Scale as well as...you guessed it...the Diminished Octanonic scale, which is featured here. All of the above mentioned scales, as well as [probably] a lot more, are able to accommodate parallel perfect fifths without breaking scale conformity. This lends for the ear to subconsciously perceive the riff's harmony as being, for lack of a better word, symmetrical. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p2200
aVI like this breakdown for what it is (about the riff) but I would like to add more.\u000a\u000aPerhaps one thing that makes the riff so jarring is its location in the song. The key modulates when it changes to this part at 5:22. I don't have any guitars with me atm so I'm not sure what the exact key is to start, but the riff before it is a simple one, using the notes of the root and the flat fifth of that key. When the riff OP asks about comes in, the root is shifted down three semitones. Note however, that this riff doesn't start on the root note of the new key. It starts on the major third, or the fourth degree of the Symmetrical scale (Byzantine scale as drop likes to call it.) The preceding riff also doesn't *end* on the root of that riff, it ends on the flat five. So listening to the two riffs independently, you wouldn't typically draw a comparison between the two at all because there are few scale steps connecting the two... but if you were to hum the root of the preceding riff and sustain it over the beginning of the next one, you would hear that it rings out three semitones over the root of the riff in question. \u000a\u000aAnother thing that happens which makes your riff worth continuing, is that the rest of the song develops as this hook is played. When in its original context, it sounds eerie and disjointed, but eventually, the drum beat is doubled over, giving it more of a marching feeling. Most good artists in any genre are capable of recognizing when good times to do this are.\u000a\u000aI think it is funny you should find this one so interesting though, but I guess it just goes to show how different people's criterion for music are. Technically speaking, it wasn't anything that hadn't been done before, it isn't hard to play or remember, nor is it an intriguing complexity. It also doesn't capitalise on a particular groove or energy that extreme metal tends to shoot for. My favorite riffs in the song have always been the one at 4:43 for it's neck breaking metalness, the one at 7:47 where the song slows down temporarily into some pseudo chromatic nonsense, and 8:56, which is one of the first strong uses of atmosphere in the genre, until it aptly flies face first into blasting madness.\u000a\u000aI guess that is what's made Darkthrone such an appealing band for so long though. Their influences are widespread, and their disjointed, uncomfortable riffs, and bipolar switches from *facebangability* to *slow-march* passages have become a staple of their style and helped create a recognizable Darkthrone sound over their entire eclectic career. To answer your question simply OP, this guitar riff is compelling because *it's motherfucking Darkthrone.*
p2201
aV"This guitar riff is compelling because it's motherfucking Darkthrone."\u000a\u000aQuestion answered. (I love Darkthrone).\u000a\u000aThank you for commenting on other parts of the song, I will listen with new ears to those. Don't know why I zoned in on 5:22, but then I'm not knowledgeable I just liked it, maybe because it sounds exotic.\u000a\u000a
p2202
aVByzantine scale. So the way the power chords are arranged, it sounds exotic but still harmonious (or symmetrical?). I think I'd be able to recognize the sound in other metal songs. Thanks for explaining this so thoroughly!
p2203
aVFor what it's worth, I've never heard it called the "diminished octatonic scale" before. Usually you just call it the diminished scale (which is a type of octatonic scale). The Byzantine scale is a different scale altogether.
p2204
aVDoes that have anything to do with a Locrian scale?
p2205
aVThe first couple of intervals are the same but no, not really. The locrian scale is one of the seven [modes](http://musictheoryblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/modes-of-major-scale.html).
p2206
aVThe rhythm section.\u000a\u000aIf the rhythm is left to play even 8ths pounding out one pitch per measure all the pressure is on the lead to be interesting. \u000a\u000aA good backup back band can make good simple lines sound masterful when arranged properly.

p2208
(lp2209
VIt's actually not bad at all! A lot better then I expected XD Great job! \u000a\u000aThe guitars are well spaced, but it does seem like they are a bit thin in sound. That may also be due to the lack of bass frequencies from your kick and bass.\u000a\u000aYou should try experimenting with boosting some lower frequencies on your bass guitar and kick drum. It really helps fill out the center of your mix, which is sounding a bit empty.\u000a\u000aAlso have you double tracked each rhythm guitar part? If not, it's definitely worth playing around with! Record each rhythm track again so that you have 2 guitars panned left and 2 panned right, but with 1 from each track panned slightly less and at a lower volume (For exmaple, the two main rhythms are panned 100% left and right, and the 2 other rhythms are panned maybe 60% left and right and at a significantly lower volume). It will really help thicken up the mix!\u000a\u000aOther then that great job! If you don't mind me asking, what are you running your guitars through? XD\u000a
p2210
aVThanks. Firstly, [here's an update](http://soundcloud.com/iuploadmymusic/yo) on the mix. Nextly, the guitar structure I have is pretty complex. The guitar chain I have is Carvin DC800 -&gt; Pod HD -&gt; Mackie Onyx (EQing out some fizz at 2.5khz) -&gt; Mbox Pro. Just looking at where the rhythm busts in, the rhythm guitars are double tracked hard panned left and right through the rest of the song. The lead is actually the same patch I just stuck a compressor between the guitar and the Pod and then putting a digital delay on the channel in the daw. The leads are the most complex part. Its a harmony of two separate notes that are quadtracked. So that means I double track one note panning the left channel hard left and the right channel about 60% then doing the opposite for the other note. Then when the second part jumps in, I have just a double track with the delay but I also have a centered track without delay to add clarity. The delay tracks add a sort of ghosting effect to the clear track. What I probably should do is take the quadtracked leads and centralize them more and take the second part and pull them out of the space that the rhythm guitars are in based on your recommendation. Every bit of advice helps so thank you. I will also try to get the lower frequencies to fill out the mix by eqing the bass and kick. 
p2211
aV[Here's an update with a fuller low end and center](https://soundcloud.com/iuploadmymusic/bass-updated)
p2212
aVVery cool riffage, man! And in general it's a well structured mix. Is it Souncloud or your good self that is supplying the brick-wall limiting? You've got the 'Disturbed' effect on this track, so when the badass heavy bit kicks in, the sound actually gets quieter, leaving me feeling less satisfied that I would be if the full dynamic range was achieved and I was pinned to my back wall with nice loud brutality. So either back way way off on the threshold on your chosen limiter/compressor, or upload a significantly quieter version to Souncloud, so their built-in compression doesn't totally destroy the dynamic range of your mix.
p2213
aVThanks a lot! I didn't think I was pushing the limiter too hard until I looked in my master channel and saw a compressor had somehow found it's little old way into intercepting the signal. Dunno how that happened... Oh well, I fixed it and the heavy kicks in a lot heavier now. [Check it out](https://soundcloud.com/iuploadmymusic/asdf-1). Also I did some bass control and kicked the hell out of the kick.

VGoodness...\u000a\u000aOk, first you shouldn't just have a single, centered guitar track. Even if you're just playing the same thing, add a second track and pan them both. Your guitar lead towards the end should be centered but kept in the mix and not on top of it. \u000a\u000aSecond, the playing is sloppy. Don't put out a sloppy product. It doesn't have to be perfect (there are bands that leave slight imperfections) but, as a first time listener, I shouldn't be able to tell you fucked up a riff. 
p2218
aVOkay. The second song is the sloppiest, imho. I had a really bad day and want to re-record that one asap. And I have all the guitar tracks panned a bit. I'm new to this whole thing.

aVHere it is, didn't want to seem self-promotional as I've posted it here just a few days ago http://type-40.bandcamp.com/
p2226
aVI gave your songs a quick listen. First off, can you give a complete rundown of your set up? I might be able to help more if i know how you're recording.\u000a Second, it sounds like you're using the drum track from guitar pro. In terms of freeware, check out [Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/), its a decent drum machine that gets the job done. The initial samples are alright, but aren't too suited for metal. I recommend downloading the 'Death Metal' drum set library. 
p2227
aVOkay, I'll check that out in the morning. I use a Line6 spider iv 75, Jackson randy rhoads. For recording I use a t.bone sc300, going to a Sony ic recorder over a phantom adapter. And indeed, I use the gp5 drums. The recorder plugs into my laptop where I edit the raw wavs with audacity and mix it all together on ohm studio. 
p2228
aVI know spending money isn't ideal for you right now, but eventually down the line you're going to need to update your equipment. I'd first look for a recording interface so you can record directly into your pc, making recording sesions easier, and giving the option to use vst tones. Your mic also isn't exactly ideal for metal. Condensers are more suited for precise/sensitive recording, which means you'll be picking up alot more unwanted distortion fizz and overbearing blare usually gotten from micing to close. Try to look for a good dynamic mic (SM57) to add to your arsenal if you have the money.\u000a\u000aNow, working with what you have, have you tried skipping the use of the mic? From what i saw, your amp has a sort of direct out/headphone jack, which could be plugged directly into your recorder. Being a digital amp, i would imagine that it would simulate a cabinet tone at output. I would use this instead of micing, as the tone would be more 'intact', making it easier to mix with in Ohm. \u000aAs mentioned by Bronan, i'm curious as to why use audacity? I would imagine Ohm would handle all your needs, and then some. If you hadn't already spent money on Ohm, i would've highly recommended Reaper as well.
p2229
aVI haven't spent money on Ohm. I use the free version. I don't really need audacity, but I'm used to it. I'll try skipping the mic. I've got the proper adapters and cables and stuff here. Dunno why I've never tried that.
p2230
aVI tried to skip the whole mic thing.... Just listen for yourself... https://soundcloud.com/rekator/tried-to-record-with-the-headphone-outpout-of-my-amp-and-my-laptop
p2231
aVThat's...ummm....interesting? The first couple seconds seemed workable. A couple of ideas. Have you tried different settings and gotten the same results? ie. lower gain, lower volume, a clean tone? Second, how are you transferring audio from the recorder to your computer? Are you recording with the recorder, then hooking up the usb to transfer files? Or are you somehow recording via your computer, like in audacity? It sounds alot like one of those two devices is having processing issues while recording.
p2232
aVI was recording that over the computer. I tried different gain settings, both on the computer and on the amp. Nothing really works. I haven't tried the recorder yet, even though that seems fairly obvious. Lack of sleep does things like that to a person.
p2233
aVI'm willing to bet it's your computer having recording issues. It never occurred to me until now, but did you record directly from the amp into your laptop's mic jack? If this is the case, and assuming that your sound card is one of those stock built in ones, you're going to have some issues. Most vanilla sound cards can only handle simple audio processing, like voice chatting. Anything closer to real time processing, you will find latency/buffering issues with the card and driver. I used to have a ghetto setup like this when i was starting out, and it was very unworkable. You may be stuck having to record every session on the Sony for the time being if this is the problem.
p2234
aVEh, I can do that. Maybe I'll buy a USB sound card, they have those things, right? 
p2235
aVYeah, anything like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-2i2-USB-Recording-Interface/dp/B005OZE9SA/ref=sr_1_4?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398987595&amp;sr=1-4) is generally all you need. Something that will specifically appeal to guitar input would be ideal, just be sure to do some product research and check your pc specs are adequate. 
p2236
aVDon't use Audacity, it is an audio editor, not a DAW. \u000a\u000a[Reaper has a 60 day trial](http://www.reaper.fm/) but the licence lasts forever like WinRAR. It only costs $60 for personal use.

The subgenres featured are classical, thrash, power, black, doom and death, in order of appearance. In the actual game, they're all played at the same time and faded in and out as weapons are switched, so it would be important for them to have the exact same tempo, length, and maybe general chord progression. \u000a\u000aI like the idea in theory, but it seems like it may be sort of a PITA to implement.\u000a\u000aCan you give 6 bands that, in your opinion are examples of the subgenres you mentioned?
p2262
aVOooooh, great suggestion. That'll really give an idea of the sound you're looking for.\u000a\u000aIf we're talking about providing original music, I'd be happy to do thrash/death though the death would be more melodeath. 
p2263
aVWhen composing, the main inspiration I took for each was respectively: Black Sabbath (really just "Children of the Grave"), Riot ("Thundersteel"), just straight-up powercheese, Vegan Black Metal Chef, Black Sabbath again ("Black Sabbath") and Dethklok.\u000a\u000aMy metal-fu is not very strong, I know.
p2264
aVHi, I actually wrote this song for a video game that I was working on a while back but it fell through. Let me know if this is any good for you and I can fix it up and make it perfectly loopable for you.\u000ahttp://soundcloud.com/stephendavidsona5tar/this-place-is-death
p2265
aVReally cool. For what it's worth, I'm shooting for a less..."electro-ey" sound, if that makes any sort of sense. Little more than chuggy guitars, beefy drums and galloping bass, plus maybe some choir for the Power part.

asVPracticing without a microphone. (X-Post r/Screaming)
p2303
(lp2304
VIt isn't necessary, just like with any other form of vocalization. You can get the added bonus of being able to get different dynamics depending on how you're screaming into the mic, and fine tune it, but you get to work on tone and the raw quality of your screams without it. Practicing with a mic is ultimately just personal preference. As for your highs, in my experience highs are difficult to attain without A. alcohol (the numbness increases risk of damage though) B. warming up and relaxing your vocal chords and throat (Tea works wonders) or C. shit loads of regular practice. I've had friends who could do highs no problem, but not lows, and vice verse. A lot of how high or low I can scream depends on if I tuck my chin against my chest or if I look up and stretch my neck out all the way.

aVIt could have a psychological effect. Having the mic might add the motivation to go all out since you're "live"

asVTips on growling?
p2318
(lp2319
VCan you provide any more info on what you're trying to achieve? There are threads on metal vocals on here all the time, you might try finding some of those for more specific advice. Regardless, I'll assume you're starting for the first time. Here's the basics as I see them:\u000a\u000a1) Look up some breathing exercises/principles. If you're new to singing/vocals in general, the concept of breathing "correctly" can be weird and foreign to some people. Essentially it comes down to breathing deeply "from the bottom up" so your chest inflates rather than your shoulders rising. This is what people mean when they say "breathe from your diaphragm." It's a bit more technical than that, but that's the short of it. On the other hand, if you were in high school band or choir or whatever, you should have already been taught this, and it's probably second nature to you.\u000a\u000a2) Just try to emulate the sounds your favorite vocalists make. It's really that simple, and you'll pick up the basics quickly. Pay attention to inflection, phrasing, and where they place vowels and consonants. Everybody has their own style, find a range and some phrasing habits that work for you!\u000a\u000a3) Your endurance will be shit at first, but don't worry, it takes incredible amounts of practice. Your voice will get tired and scratchy, but it should NOT hurt. If you're experiencing pain, there's something up with your technique...take a break, drink some water, and try again. \u000a\u000a4) Drink water. Think you've had enough water? Drink more water. 
p2320
aVI don't know if this is everyone, but once my throat starts getting dry, I simply cannot growl anymore.  Keep a bottle of water handy if you're on stage.
p2321
aVI'm not sure why you are getting troll responses on this, but perhaps it would help if you gave more information on what you're looking for.\u000a\u000aFor instance : Do you already know how to scream / growl? Is your technique solid? Is there a particular type of growl that you'd like to be able to do? Are there tutorials you've watched that get you close to what you're looking for but need some clarification?\u000a\u000aOtherwise some general advice : It should not hurt - ever. Use your diaphragm (not lungs) to push and control all of your air and don't do anything that leaves your throat sore or your voice hoarse. Stay hydrated and shape your tone with your mouth and tongue - just play around with it to see what you can achieve. Also make sure to do at least some basic vocal warmups.\u000a
p2322
aVTry to do a low register kind of mumble in the back of your throat,then push it out using your diaphram.It shouldn't ever hurt though,it should be a bit like yelling tbh imo
p2323
aVTrust the sound that comes out: meaning don't get stuck trying too hard to emulate other artists or you could do permanent damage trying to strain your vcs to reach that sound.
p2324
aVIf it hurts too much, you are doing it wrong. Also, inhale vocals are really bad and unnatural and will guarantee you a short career as a vocalist.
p2325
aVCheck out /r/screaming\u000a\u000aLots of great stuff on there with practicing musicians giving advice and posting videos on the different techniques...it was a big eye-opener for me.\u000a\u000aedit: and this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teo7gZlJqXU&amp;feature=youtu.be

p2328
asVBass tunings??
p2329
(lp2330
VYou don't need to tune up. \u000a\u000aMeshuggah does this to match the eight string guitars. Now, Meshuggah are, uh... *unique*. when they began using eight strings, there were no commercially available eight string guitars, and extended range basses were a rarity. So not only did nobody know what to do with a bass that would have to be tuned nearly an octave down to match the guitars (Meshuggah tunes to F), there was no equipment available that could facilitate that for bass. Very few cabinets could handle that range, and no strings thick enough to hold tension there existed, so Meshuggah's solution was to just tune up the bass and have it play unison parts. Their explanation for continuing to do this these days is that it's part of the sound now.\u000a\u000aNow, I don't know about you, but the only bassist I've heard of doing this is Dick from  Meshuggah. These days, there really is no excuse to tune up anymore, except as an artistic decision. Heavy strings are easier to find, there are cabinets and basses that can handle F# (and even down to C#). \u000a\u000aThat's F-F#. A seventh down. The lowest you're looking at is A#, less than a fifth down. As a bassist, I can tell you this is FINE for conventional tuning an octave below the guitars. I wouldn't even call that a very low tuning. Alex Webster has been using A# since 1995 with great success, and there are plenty of people who tune lower than that no problem. Off the top of my head:\u000a\u000a* [Jeff Hughell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplRR_CfkkI) of Brain Drill, Reciprocal, and Six Feet Under tunes to Drop A frequently, but usually plays in G Standard, even lower.\u000a*[ Adam "Nolly" Getgood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMxbP1V3WBo) from Periphery tunes to all sorts of crazy stuff to match their seven and eight strings. Drop C with a low G below the C, Drop G#, and even F# Standard.\u000a* Every bassist [Nile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99KHIkENKBM) has had since 1993 has tuned to Drop A no problems\u000a* Derek Boyer from[ Suffocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peP_xXWXtPM) tunes to C# Standard with a low G#\u000a* Come to think of it, [Alex Webster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJQX4Ow2NHQ) uses [G# Standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3tTp7tgAbI) a lot in Cannibal Corpse, and uses Drop A in both his other bands.\u000a\u000aI myself have gone down to G Standard no problems. All you really need to downtune to drop C-A# are thicker strings. Most bass amps can reproduce those fundamentals or close to it, and those aren't low enough to warrant a longer scale length. This can be a little tricky, though, since string sets are made for standard tuning in fourths as a general rule. You may have to pick strings carefully to achieve a pleasant tension.\u000a\u000aSo yes. If I've confused you anywhere, please let me know and I'll clear it up. Otherwise, good luck!
p2331
aVThis is only when the guitars are too low for the bass to easily play an octave down. To me, this territory was anything lower than A#. This, of course, assumes 35 inch scale and commercially available strings. \u000a\u000a\u000aMost basses handle drop A with no major issues. 
p2332
aVOh alright thanks! Haha so what exactly would I be tuning to? I have to track some bass parts (I'm a guitarist) and have no idea what I'm doing, as bass is some differently entirely and a buddy of mines bass is super out of tune, a chromatic tuner can tune basses right?
p2333
aVIn the tunings you mentioned, you really shouldn't have a problem tuning your bass just like you tune your guitar. On a four string, drop A# would be A#-F-A#-D#, drop B would be B-F#-B-E, and drop C would be C-G-C-F.
p2334
aV[deleted]
p2335
aVOne of my guitars is in drop G# - my bass handles it fine, but it is a 6 string. Anything below that I would probably tune up to.\u000a\u000aSo if it's in Drop F, tune the bass exactly the same as the guitar. The bass itself produces more bass frequencies than the guitar in the same octave anyway. You will still get bass in your songs. 
p2336
aVMechanically you can have some issues; I had to drill out the bridge on my Schecter five-string to accommodate a low string thick enough to handle tuning down to drop A and my heavy pick hand. I agree with everyone else, stay low bro.
p2337
aVIn my band we play guitars tuned to drop C.\u000a\u000aMy bass player found the best solution was to tune his 5 string bass UP a half step, to put him in C standard. \u000a\u000aIf he tuned down to match us like a normal bass would, he would tune his E string to C and his B all the way down to G. By tuning up a half step, it made his lowest string one octave lower than the lowest string on the guitars. As long as he ran with light gauge strings he did not have any issues with the bass's set up. If he tuned down he would definitely have had to do some work on the instrument to get that low G to work.
p2338
aVI've never heard of anyone doing that before, and I think that tuning up to a low tuned guitar would cause everything to sound flat (dimensionally, not pitch-wise). The bass is supposed to occupy a different frequency range than guitars, and this is especially important in metal to get the "full" sound. Instead of tuning up, tune down or use a bass with 5th string.
p2339
aVAhh thank you, well I heard Meshuggah's bassist does this to be specific haha but yeah I didn't think it would work well drop A# but I wanted to give it a shot!
p2340
aVTheir bassist uses a 5 string, with the E string tuned up to their usual F# tuning. As for the other strings, I'm not sure. 
p2341
aVAhh yes I forgot about the 5th string haha

VI would turn up the main riff a good bit louder for the guitars. They don't pump enough. The structure is very cool and does make sense to me.  This track kinda has a Tool vibe and I like it.  I would suggest maybe going double time with the guitars to follow the drums around 2:22 or at least change your strum pattern a bit to give the song a different dimension through there. The song could definitely use some low end but I enjoy the guitars quite a bit. Cool track dude.

p2359
aVMustis used Symphonic Orchestra, which I believe is now called EastWest Quantum Leap Orchestra + Choir. I use it and I love it. I can't say I have any experience with their support. It also uses a shit load of ram compared to the other two options you presented.
p2360
aVHow much ram are you running, and do you experience any issues?
p2361
aV8 gb ram and I don't really experience any issues until I have about 12 tracks+ running. The lag is mostly when I'm loading a new track (after 2 or so tracks). After about 12+ tracks, the computer lags when I start playing a song, but only at first. It corrects itself after a few seconds.
p2362
aVAlright, so i should be good in that regard.
p2363
aVNI Session Strings sound really good and Voxos are really great choral libraries that require very little post processing.
p2364
aVWhelp, after some last minute thinking and a little new years alcohol, i decided to take a leap... a Quantum Leap that is (buh dum, *crash*). I opted for the EastWest symphonic orchestra and choir deal, as i felt the deal was a little too good to pass up. Maybe in the future when my budget opens up i'll add other programs to my repertoire. Hopefully things will work out well. Thanks for everyone's input, if all goes well i might do a follow up on how things turned out.
p2365
aVThe QL Orchestra and the QL Choir will work fine for you. Their samples are a bit old and not exactly state of the art but if you're producing metal metal then they will more than suffice. I don't think I've ever needed their customer support. iLok is a hassle but once it's set up it's done forever.\u000a\u000aKomplete is an awesome bundle but all it offers you directly for this purpose are the bundled Kontakt libraries. The Session Strings are good - and since most of the time "symphonic metal" means "metal with a string section" you may be in luck. But if you want brass as well (or, maybe less probable, woodwind and orchestral percussion), you won't have that. Guitar Rig is nice enough but I don't think it should be your main choice for metal guitar recording, even with the Rammfire pack that comes with Komplete. Revalver is better, as is Amplitube. And there are many freeware or inexpensive VST sims that are equal to or better than these (eg. the LePou collection, or the [TSE X50](http://www.tseaudio.com/software/x50v2).)\u000a\u000aBy comparison, I have no experience with Vienna Symphonic. They are supposedly better than the EWQL samples, but maybe the special edition is cut down. I'm sure you must realise that *"Dry samples that require a lot of processing to sound natural"* doesn't really make sense. :) A dry sample is the most realistic sample - what you probably mean is that it doesn't sound like it's been recorded in a massive hall, but that's easily solved with a reverb bus and maybe careful panning. You're going to want to EQ orchestral instruments to make them sit well in a metal mix anyway so don't expect any free lunches here from any of these libraries.\u000a\u000aRegarding resource use, samplers are cheap to run. The most important thing is that you have enough memory, which in this case means you must be running a 64-bit DAW in a 64-bit operating system. If that's not the case, you'll probably need to bounce down each track as you go, or work with less resource-intensive tracks during composition and switch to the full versions at the end (again, bouncing as you go).
p2366
aVThanks for the response. I can't tell you how reassuring a positive experience with QL is. With regards to Komplete, i think my main allure were the extra toys that would come besides Kontakt. I understand Guitar rig isn't the best for metal since it's a bitch dialing a decent distortion tone, and i have used LePou's amps and other free vst's, however the added effect tools and non metal amps are pretty convenient to me as a bedroom hobbyist not too concerned with solely writing metal. If anything, i may just buy their products next time they go on sale.\u000aWith VSL, you're right by what i meant with the dry samples. I think the concern i have is trying to replicate a reverb environment that would sound decent with what little tools and experience i have. This again is where i think tools from Komplete like Reflektor would come in handy.\u000a\u000aYou also mentioned QL isn't quite state of the art. Could you explain what you mean by that?
p2367
aV&gt; I think the concern i have is trying to replicate a reverb environment that would sound decent with what little tools and experience i have. \u000a\u000aPretty much any reverb plugin is going to be good enough for your purposes. Reflektor is powerful but isn't going to be significantly better than freeware alternatives and probably no easier to use either.\u000a\u000a&gt; You also mentioned QL isn't quite state of the art. Could you explain what you mean by that?\u000a\u000aThe samples are old, the way you use them is not as versatile as others (eg. there's no ability to map different velocities to different articulations), and newer libraries might have more articulations and more samples per articulation, making them sound a bit more realistic (though that will be the least of your troubles when getting to grips with orchestral scoring on a computer).
p2368
aVI was in a similar position and bought komplete. I am incredibly happy with it.
p2369
aVWhat lead to your decision? Also, have had any experience with any 3rd party developers that use kontakt?
p2370
aV[Symphobia 2](https://www.projectsam.com/Products/Symphobia-Series/1390). I use this more than any other orchestral library. It's on every track of my [demo album](http://Bretheren.bandcamp.com) for reference.
p2371
aVProjectSAM definitely popped up a lot in my search, and while Symphobia really sounds impressive, it's currently outside my budget. BTW, really dig the AOE track.
p2372
aVThanks man! They also have [Orchestral Essentials](https://www.projectsam.com/Products/Essentials-Series/1446) which is samples from Symphobia with some fat trimmed for cheaper. But I see you already made up your mind! EastWest is great as well, and honestly most of these libraries all sound good if you know how to use them properly! Good luck to you man
p2373
aVI have used both the Kontakt Factory Library and the East West Orchestra.\u000a\u000aThe Kontakt samples aren't quite as high quality and there aren't as many variations on the sounds for certain instruments, but it's far easier to use regarding MIDI control and simplification in general. The sounds are also easier to fit into a mix of other VST's or audio, especially in something like a metal track. \u000a\u000aThe East West samples are very nice sounding on their own but I find it more difficult to work with them. They have a lot of reverb on the samples and are pre panned to fit in the space they were recorded in with the other instruments. These are much harder to fit into a metal track because of how beefy and room-oriented they are. These sounds offer very little for customization. I really like the way East-West sounds in an exclusively orchestral setting, but it's overkill for any other mixes really. \u000a\u000aPersonally I'd go with Komplete because Guitar Rig is worth it for any metal musician, and the orchestral sounds are still very nice. Not to mention the other plugins and cool stuff it comes with. \u000a\u000aEdit: Did not notice you already with with East West. Still a good choice. :)
p2374
aVI still wouldn't mind getting komplete some time in the future, just not at full retail price. Seeing how NI doesn't tend to give it discounts, i'll probably wait for an occasional price cut of Guitar Rig, then cross grade when i have money to waste.

(lp2394
VMy two big criticisms are the guitars and the vocals. For the guitars, I think it would sound great if you upped the distortion and the volume, and make them sound 'huge'. Also, there's too much attack on the guitars. It kind of takes away from the massive 'wall of sound' atmosphere you're going for. Take the cue from Darkspace here. As for the vocals, they should also sound a bit more aggressive. Here, they sound like an angry mutter. Scream and howl into the mic, then tone it down and add your echo/reverb. Also, I might want to use slightly simpler, less snare-heavy drum patterns. If I were you, I would also try using a drum program like Hydrogen or the one built into Logic [if you use a mac]. That's the one I use for my project, and it sounds great when you play with it enough. I certainly enjoyed this song, but with some work, your future stuff could rival some of the more well-known space black metal bands. Good luck!

VYou should've named the EP "In Flames"
p2403
aVLol yeah...we came up with the name then realized it was an In Flames album already. Decided what the hell and still used the name. 
p2404
aVIt sounds decent for being on a budget (self mixing/mastering). The material was obviously created by competent musicians, I'm just not sure there is enough separating this material from the rest of the metalcore scene. But don't take that too harshly, I'm not much of a metalcore fan so it kinda all sounds the same to me anyway. 
p2405
aVThanks, I didn't have as much involvement in the mixing and mastering as  I would have liked for this release but I think we still got decent results. And I appreciate the feedback, we're still working on our sound. 
p2406
aVI really hope I didn't come off dickish. It's clear you're all talented musicians, and I really don't want to take wind out of your sails. As I said, I may not be picking up your distinct sound due to not being a big fan of the scene. \u000a\u000a\u000aThat being said, I don't think it would hurt to flavor your sound with something unique to possibly widen your audience.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, there's something to be said about knowing what you're getting when you pick up an album from a specific sub-genre. \u000a\u000a\u000aAll that really matters in the end is that you're happy with what you've got. If you are then fuck everyone else. \u005cm/\u000a
p2407
aVNot at all dickish, I'm looking for honest critique. We are looking to head in a slightly more proggy direction with our new music so maybe that's the part of our sound that can help us be some uniqueness. 
p2408
aVWhat kind of feedback? \u000a\u000aOn the mixing?\u000a\u000aOn the writing?\u000a\u000aOn the playing? \u000a\u000aOr do you want opinions?
p2409
aVYes to all really. Anything would be great.
p2410
aVReminds me of early Trivium, which is the best Trivium in my opinion. Songs are solid and production is good. Although I feel like there used to be a lot of bands that sounded like this, the metalcore scene seems to have been replaced with a bunch of Devil Wears Prade clones, so in that sense you actually do stand out a lot more than a lot of bands I have heard recently.

VYou got a good voice, but theres no dynamic changes throughout the song. Kind of boring right now, but if you add some louder rangers here and there, with some more melody behind the vocals, it would help.
p2421
aVThanks! agreed I really struggle with writing vocal melodies. I really do not like singing but its really hard to find dependable vocalists so every now and then I try it myself. I think my tone is okay but I struggle with knowing my range and do not have very much confidence in my voice.
p2422
aVDon't know why you're getting downvoted. Vocals aren't my specialty but I love how you sound. Going off of everyone else, yes you can improve dynamically but it sounds better than gargling nails and hoping for the best (which imo, is most of the singers here). You have a lot of potential to work off of and it sounds good.

VTypical lead guitarist, can't write a riff to save his life.\u000a\u000aBut seriously, the lead playing is outstanding, really fluid and interesting, it's just that none of the riffs stand out at all. If you worked more on the rhythm guitar and compositional side of things you'd have a much better song.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p2474
aVThanks a lot, I'm so glad that you pointed that out. It's like I knew all along but was in denial. I never feel particularly proud of my rhythm sections and now I realize why: I'm not approaching them the right way. I will definitely take the extra time and steps to improve that side of my composition. 
p2475
aVI agree, it seemed like a lot of the riffs were just taking up space between lead parts. Vocals will help fill that out some, but I still think you need to work on the riff writing.

aVI think you're talented ss hell, but yeah... the riffs could certainly have more hook.  I'm sure you've played with others before, since it's hard to develop chops like that on your own, but still... work with a real drummer.  He (or she) will force you to develop some of those rythms. Shredding is great and all, but that's not what makes a great song.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p2482
aVThis is definitely a good point to make. I'm a drummer but I have no real way of connecting with you. However I will definitely attest to the way in which I make the guitarists I play with seriously consider the rhythms they create, while they simultaneously help me to drum in a way that is conducive to good riffage. Either way, can't wait to hear more from you as you're quite talented.

p2495
(lp2496
VIt's a boring answer, but it's all practice. Your voice is made up of muscles. The more you work out these muscles (properly, mind you - don't strain!), the more elastic and responsive they become.\u000a\u000aIn my experience, the best way to gain range is a three-pronged approach. First, do 10-15min of scales and thirds, up and down, moving up and down keys chromatically. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MUSCULATURE! You must, MUST be accurate in every note before you move on. \u000a\u000aNext, break up the boring scales by singing a song you like, that's relatively easy to sing. Maybe just on the CUSP of your range. Finally, back to scales, then a few octaves (again ACCURACY), then try a song that's just a bit out of your range. \u000a\u000aGo slow, and work your way up. It's a process that takes a while. People don't turn into swollen monsters after one week in the gym, and you won't turn into Bruce or Dio after one week either. Sing everywhere, all the time. Take it slow, work your way up, and listen to your body.\u000a\u000aDon't forget to cool down as well!
p2497
aV&gt; First, do 10-15min of scales and thirds, up and down, moving up and down keys chromatically. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MUSCULATURE! You must, MUST be accurate in every note before you move on. \u000a\u000aCould you elaborate on this? What should a learning vocalist be looking out for, specifically?
p2498
aVSure. As you move through the scale, make a mental note of the musculature of your throat at the pitch you're on. This will slightly change based on your pitch. Higher notes will make the throat constrict tighter, and lower notes will open the throat. However, no two positions will ever be exactly the same. \u000a\u000aIf you pay attention to what, say a G# feels like in your throat, you'll have an easier time recalling that position when you're singing. Often times we're singing at shitty dive bars with terrible monitoring, right? :-) \u000a\u000aIf you can rely on your muscle memory to tell you if you're on the correct pitch ALONG with hearing the note, you'll be a much more accurate singer.\u000a\u000aObligatory self-whoring "here's my band" post - http://www.LordsOfTheTrident.com

V* Rhythmically, you could spice it up a bit. Just a lot of runs of 8th notes and 16th notes isn't that interesting.\u000a\u000a* Like /u/SolomonKull pointed out, timing is a bit of an issue.\u000a\u000a* You're out of tune. That's not a "playing" issue, but worth fixing on future play throughs.\u000a\u000a\u000aOtherwise, you have some good ideas. It can be improved, but it's absolutely not bad, just if you fix some of the more glaring problems.
p2506
aVThanks for the criticism! The tuning issue you hear is my guitar's intonation not being right for drop B tuning. I'm working on getting it fixed but I don't have any money currently lol
p2507
aV*Warning: I'm going to sound like a dickhead and deconstruct a lot of something that I'm sure you put some good hours into creating. But it might help you become better at what you obviously love doing.  \u000aFor the record, I have virtually zero social life and spend most of my free time absorbed in learning about music.  \u000aThere will be some heavy theory stuff here. If you don't know what the terms mean, look them up\u2014you'll be better off as a writer if you do. Remember, music theory is not a pretentious set of rules that you* must *follow, but merely an exhaustive set of pretty damn good suggestions and guidelines for writing music that pleases you, the composer, as well as has potential to captivate an audience. Also remember that it often boils down to ambiguous subjectivity.* On with it:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a**technique**  \u000a\u2013work on your timing. work on your timing. *work on your timing.* If you're gonna sit around and noodle and wank and jam by yourself without playing along to a song you're learning, **use a metronome.**  \u000a\u2013[develop consistent vibrato on sustained notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L68rxhMq6Kw)  \u000a\u2013develop muting technique (muting the strings not currently played), and tie a sock or stick a terry cloth wristband around the neck lower on the fretboard for recording super-clean lead passages.\u000a\u000a**composition**  \u000a\u000a\u2013seems like you've got a pretty good grasp on scales, but some parts jump out as completely non-musical. See:\u000a\u000a1. the sweep-diddly at 1:53 (that just might be a technical biff, or else an attempt at Kerry King-esque superfast atonality). Always ask yourself, "Does this actually call for [slick part you came up with]?" Yeah, sweeping and heroics are cool, but not always necessary. There's jarring ("holy fuck that transition was cool, he really changed it up there"), and then there's *jarring* ("that part didn't really make sense"). Consider that there's a time and place for everything, and it might not be here.  \u000a2. the C-natural at 2:01\u2014it's squawking out of key. I understand that you might be trying to achieve intentional dissonance, but this is not coming out as the "good kind" and really betrays an amateur status (not that I'm some fucking pro, 'cause I'm not). You're in B minor, and you've previously established the supertonic (2nd scale degree) as being C#, so if you're going to stick in a dissonant supertonic there, you might consider using the already established C#, figuring out a way of modulating into B Phrygian somewhere before this point and keeping the C-natural, or instead aiming for consonance using the mediant (3rd degree), dominant (5th) or leading tone/subtonic (7th). \u000a3. Try writing a solo that has some sort of form/pattern instead of one that's through-composed. One big, long solo that takes you around the world can too easily call to mind [this kind of nonsense.](http://youtu.be/qOFgKy_CDX4?t=2m10s)\u000a\u000a**instrument**  \u000a\u2013you've obviously been playing for some time, so I know you know how to tune your instrument, but (in my observation) even some experienced guitarists are completely unaware of the concept of intonation. I think your guitar needs an intonation fix, since a lot of your sustained notes are ringing out as in-key, but noticeably flat or sharp. You can take it to a music shop and pay to have some never-was rockstar turd with a lip piercing do it, or [do it on your own, it's very easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1ZM9IGnIcY) (it's difficult for me to see your bridge, but I think I got it right). Either that, or you're fretting too hard (in which case, be careful with frethand pressure, and get some heavier strings if you're not already using a very thick gauge.
p2508
aVIf i could upvote this more I would. I really do appreciate someone taking the time to deconstruct my material and tell me what needs to be fixed and what I am doing correctly. I do want to address a few things though. \u000aI do know the intonation on my guitar is set for drop C tuning so the notes being noticeably sharp or flat is due to the fact that I'm in drop B and I haaaaaaate staying in just one tuning because I feel like it limits what I can do. I'm trying to get a 7 string for that reason and maybe another 6 string so I can keep one guitar at a set tuning and not have to worry about my intonation being screwed up. But for now all I have is 1 guitar, one bass, and freeware recording equipment. \u000aI like the fact that you point out some of the non-musical things that I put in there because I had intentionally put them there to kinda add to the song because I intended for that to be the climax of the song. But this was my 3rd attempt at trying to write a song that didn't need lyrics to it (If you listen to most of the songs on my channel you will notice that they do need lyrics but I don't do any vocals because I sound like a dying cat) so while I might have 7 years of playing guitar under my belt, I only have about a year of writing material by myself and not with a full band. \u000aAnd for the super clean lead tones, I don't really believe in putting a sock or a wristband around the neck. I guess it's just a pet peeve of mine but I'd much rather attempt to get the best possible lead I can without the use of anything extra.\u000aAgain, I thank you for the criticism and I will definitely keep in mind everything you pointed out. If you would, I would love for you to watch for my posts and do this same thing again because I really do strive to be as good as I can be with my craft and people like you surely do help! 
p2509
aVI'm a lot more into thrash, stoner and death metal than the style you play, but here goes;\u000a\u000a* The shred parts seemed a little out of place, I think some kind of transitional lick from the preceding parts would help\u000a* The non-shred parts might go on for a bit too long, or could do with slightly more variation \u000a\u000aOther than that, I thought it was a decent composition. Maybe tighten up your timing on the shred parts like the other commenter said 
p2510
aV&gt; The non-shred parts might go on for a bit too long, or could do with slightly more variation\u000a\u000aThis is what I'd say. 1:07 to 1:16 could have ended at 1:09
p2511
aVYou lose timing at the 1:00 mark. Big time. In fact, whenever you play really fast, you have terrible timing. So, hone your timing skills. 
p2512
aVI appreciate the criticism! Although besides the opening fast lick I can't exactly hear anywhere else where I'm noticeably out of time. If you could point out another instance so I know what you are talking about that would be much appreciated :)
p2513
aV**timbre**  \u000athe lead guitar tone you're using may not be appropriate. Try nudging down your gain and/or lows slightly. Or drastically! The more gain you have, the more soft-clip compression you introduce to the pre-amp and amp stage within the vacuum tubes. This would be hard-clip on a solid state transistor amp (Dimebag-esque tone). The more lows you have, the more speaker cone compression you introduce. These principles apply as well to simulators (Guitar Rig, *etc*), since they intentionally attempt to emulate the behavior of real amplifiers. \u000a\u000aAnyway, it's relevant because the more compression you have (of either type), the more your picking articulation turns to mush, especially with fast passages and ESPECIALLY with palm muting. There's a very fast "breathing/pumping" effect that you'll learn to identify, and this effect can really easily fool the listener into perceiving your playing as being out of time, even if you're butthole-tight.

Putting a small mid scoop on the entire track and playing it off like you wanted a "vintage feel", subsequently winning a grammy.

p2523
aVNice. The "Realtime Export" option is in the bottom right of the audio export panel. It takes a while longer because it will play the track and render it "live".. it eats a lot of memory so try not to play any graphic intensive FPS's during the process.

aVAre you doing anything weird like up'ing the bitrate on export (16-bit -&gt; 24-bit) or anything? Are there any effects running on your master bus? Are you exporting a plain stereo-interlaced file and not some other weird channel or anything? In my experience Cubase does not make mistakes, there is probably something you are doing or some setting you have that is wrong.
p2529
aVI'm new to Cubase, so I very well may be missing something.  I just checked the Mix Console and there is nothing on the master channel and there is no clipping on the the master channel levels. \u000a\u000aIn terms of the export I've just been using the default settings, which are as follows:\u000a\u000a* Insert iMXL Chunk (It's a check box, it's checked)\u000a* Sample Rate: 44.100 KH\u000a* Bit Depth: 32 Bit (Float)\u000a* Export as Wave File\u000a\u000a
p2530
aVI bet it's the 32-bit thing. What are you recording in, 16-bit or 24-bit? I've never heard of using 32-bit to record. Export in the same bit-depth you record in, any other number doesn't make sense. More and more people are using 24-bit to record, but a CD will only support 16-bit so you'd have to downgrade the bit-rate and dither it. Anyway, try exporting in 16-bit and 24-bit and see if there is any difference.\u000a\u000aNot sure what iMXL chunk is, I probably have an older version of Cubase than you.
p2531
aVThanks, that's really good information to know. \u000a\u000aIs there a way to check the bit rate I'm recording in?
p2532
aVShould be under project settings. That's where you set the sample rate as well. 
p2533
aVAh, thanks so much for all the responses dude.\u000a\u000aIf you don't mind, could you give me a brief explanation of what Bit-Rate and Sample-Rate do? I think I have a basic understanding of sample rate, but bit-rate I don't.
p2534
aVFirst you have to consider what a digital audio stream is. When you feed an analog signal into an ADC (*analog to digital converter*, which are generally found in the soundcard or pre-amp outputs), you are essentially feeding a small, alternating voltage through the ADC. This analog voltage is usually generated from such sources as: a guitar pickup output, a microphone output, etc. From there, the ADC *samples* the voltage into a digital format. What you end up with in your digital waveform is essentially a digital model of the analog voltage you are sampling.\u000a\u000aSample rate is how many times per second the ADC *samples* the analog voltage. Bit-depth is how many bits you can represent the amplitude (volume) with. The way I like to think of it is like steps. If you are recording in 16-bit, you have 2^16 different steps with which to represent the volume with. 2^16 = 65536 (or 65535 if you include 0, which ADC's do.) This means that your ADC has 65535 available "levels" to sample the analog voltage at. If you zoom in super close to a digital waveform, it will basically look like stairs, and this is because you are looking at the limits of the ADC's ability to sample a purely analog signal. Then you have to consider that the voltage/signal swings from positive to negative, so you only have 65535 *in total*. On either the positive or negative side, you have half of that, 32768.\u000a\u000aSo when we put the two together, let's say you are recording at 16-bit, 44.1kHz (pretty standard), that means your ADC is tapping/sampling the analog source votlage 44,100 times per second, with an accuracy of 65,535 positions in total. Another way to think of bit-depth is to consider +32,768 as the absolute loudest sample you can possibly have before digital clipping occurs.\u000a\u000aThe reason recording in higher bit-depth and sample rate is good is because it more accurately mimics the analog signal. I like to record in 24-bit / 96kHz, which means the ADC is tapping the source voltage 96,000 times per second, with 2^24 (or 16,777,216 -- WAY more) available levels to represent the volume/amplitude.\u000a\u000aAnother issue is the *Nyquist frequency*, which basically states that the maximum frequency a digital system can replicate is actually half of the sample rate. This is because the most crude, yet complete cycle of a digital waveform requires at least 2 bits to represent. This is a horrible, saw-tooth waveform, with 1 sample representing the peak of the wave and 1 sample representing the trough of the wave. If you record at 44.1kHz, the highest frequency you can capture is half of that -- 22,050Hz. And even then, it will be a nasty saw-tooth waveform. At 96kHz, the highest frequency you can capture is 48kHz, which is easily far above the range of human hearing. This means that the frequencies that *ARE* at the top end of human hearing (usually around 20-22kHz) are more accurately represented, rather than being mocked-up as a shitty saw-tooth waveforms. High frequencies are stuff like the wash on cymbals or sibilance in speech. It's the air in the sound. Quiet, but noticeable. As much as people knock it, you need clarity at the very high-end of your spectrum. It's one of those things that is almost impossible to nail down but when you hear a great recording done in 24/96, you can hear it.\u000a\u000aFor what it's worth, I would recommend doing all rough-drafts/demos in 16/44.1 and anything you release, do it in 24/96 or 24/88.2 if you can. Like I said, I've never heard of anyone doing 32-bit recording, and even then, I wouldn't advise it. *Floats* are a type of data that are inherently prone to rounding errors due to the limits of the way CPUs handle these types of data, and I'm not sure the benefit would be worth the increased file size and processing requirements.
p2535
aVWow. Thank you for the amazing response man.  Not only did that satisfy my curiosity and give me enough knowledge to roughly understand, but the depth you went into made me really understand what is going on, which I think will really increase my ability to utilize different settings more effectively and actually know why.\u000a\u000aTaking some of the mystical behind the scenes bullshit out of what the different settings mean makes me a lot more comfortable with using the program/dealing with recording. \u000a\u000aEDIT: I just checked the project settings, it's recording as 16/44.1, so I think you nailed it with the wrong export bit-rate.  \u000a\u000aSo Exporting at a higher bit rate than it's recorded at will basically force the audio to split up into more volume steps which distorts the audio?\u000a\u000aAlso by the way, even if this has nothing to do with that rumbling, I still appreciate immensely. It's been really useful stuff to learn and you explained it really well.\u000a\u000a
p2536
aVNo worries, glad to help. The thing about digital recording is that it is basically an art unto itself. Sure, you're a musician. That doesn't necessarily mean a thing when it comes to digital recording. It helps to know a bit about how computers operate as well. I know from my old programming days that a *float* data-type is basically a digital representation of a decimal number. Since the computer works with 2-bit logic (0 or 1), every step further down the decimal you go (tenth, hundredth, thousandth, ten-thousandth, etc.) inherently increases the amount of data required to accurately represent that decimal place. At a certain point, accuracy just goes out the window. 16-bit and 24-bit bit-depths are an *int*, IE: an integer, which is a nice clean whole number and is much more easily (and more importantly, with full accuracy) represented via 2-bit logic. You can have 32-bit ints, but the fact that the makers of Cubase have specifically written "(float)" next to 32-bit means that when you record in a 32-bit depth in Cubase, it is storing all the values of your waveform under a float data type.\u000a\u000aAnyway, if you are exporting at 32-bit and recording at 16-bit, you're basically exporting at a level that is magnitudes above the level you recorded at with no actual gain.  16-bit is 65,535. 32-bit is 4,294,967,296. That's 65.5 thousand vs. 4.2 billion. It's like taking a photo with a nice DSLR camera, exporting the photo as a .JPEG with high compression, then renaming the file to the native file format the camera uses and expecting the quality to jump back up. It doesn't work that way. It doesn't force the audio to do anything, it shouldn't change your audio signal at all. All it will do is take up way, way more filespace for no reason.\u000a\u000aMy guess is that the source of your problem is that your soundcard does not support 32-bit audio streams in any manner and when you feed it one, the soundcard driver and/or the hardware itself trips out and chokes on the data-stream, essentially. \u000a\u000aAs I mentioned, just export in the same bit-depth you recorded in. It's better to start higher and downgrade later if you need to (IE: record in 24-bit then dither down to 16-bit if you have to). If you've recorded in 16-bit, there is no way to go to 24-bit or 32-bit. The notion is literally meaningless.\u000a\u000aEDIT: If you are wondering why they don't just use ints instead of floats for 32-bit recording, the issue lies in the fact that a digital waveform has to include positive and negative values, because it is modeling an analog alternating current, which intrinsically contains positive and negative values. A 32-bit int is a special type of int called an *unsigned int* which means it "has no sign" as in, no + or -. It is positive only, though the notion of positivity is meaningless when there is no negativity to compare it to. It *only* goes from 0 to 4.2 billion. If you try to do some negative-number math with an unsigned int, you get errors. What I'm looking forward to is a full implementation of the new 64-bit CPUs into audio recording. This means we could have 64-bit floats, and 32-bit int recording. 64-bit float would be 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (18.4 quintillion) available steps to represent volume, which is frankly rather insane. 32-bit ints is probably all you would ever need for listening purposes. However, with 64-bit depth you could get into some other strange uses for digital waveforms which are outside the realm of audio/listening. Of greater concern, beyond the 32-bit depth point, is a higher sampling rate. I'd rather have 32/192 as the norm, vs. 64/96 as the norm. Most people probably think I am nuts, though!
p2537
aVAnother thought I had is that your buffer size may be too small or too large. Are you using a fully supported ASIO soundcard? Sometimes if your buffer size is too small, you can get weird artefacts. A smaller buffer size nets you a lower latency time, because it fills and dumps the audio buffer from the soundcard into your computer more frequently, but if your computer can't keep up (CPU too slow or HDD too slow or both, etc., etc.) then you get weird negative effects. Definitely you should export in 16-bit if you record in 16-bit but also check out your buffer size. Set it as low as you can go before you start getting weird artefacts in your sound like pops/clicks/bird chirps/etc.
p2538
aVThat's another good point.  I generally set the buffer pretty low, maybe 5th lowest on a 6 point scale.  I've never noticed any artifact issues like clicks and pops though. I'm running a dual core i7 with multi-threading.\u000a\u000aI exported it at 16/44.1 and the rumble is still there but seems to be a lot less noticeable.
p2539
aVShould be good then. Another thing you can do is schedule your CPU to give priority cycles to "background processes", which includes dumping incoming audio streams from the bus into memory. I'm still on WinXP so the method is likely different for me. But I right click My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Advanced tab -&gt; Under Performance click Settings button -&gt; Advanced tab again -&gt; Processor scheduling -&gt; Background processes.\u000a\u000aThere is something else wrong if you still have the rumble. What did you record with? Did you set a HPF on any of your tracks? It maybe be that one of your mics just picked up some very low level frequencies and you never EQ'd them out.
p2540
aVI recorded direct with a POD HD400 and used EZ Drummer for the drums, so not a mic issue. I'll end up re-recording it at some point anyway I'm sure, so I'm not incredibly concerned anymore as long as it doesn't keep happening with new tracks.\u000a\u000aI haven't recorded anything since, so I'm not sure if it will keep happening. If it does then I'll really have to figure out what's up with it.\u000a\u000a
p2541
aVAhh... that's interesting. If you recorded direct with your POD HD400, you probably want to take a look at the sample rate of that thing and make sure it matches with your sound card. How are you feeding the signal? Via TRS (headphone jack) or XLR, or is it a digital feed? If it's a digital feed, you need to synchronize the timing crystals on both devices with a master word clock. You can do this by setting one device as a master device and the other as a slave device. Slave devices read the word clock from the master device's internal crystal for accurate synch across devices. OR, you can get a dedicated word clock device (like Big Ben), whose sole purposes is to synchronize other devices. This is likely excessive if you only have 2 devices. Keep in mind this only applies if the output signal is digital.\u000a\u000aYou have to do this because otherwise the two devices are basically sampling the signal at different times, in an absolute sense. So, say device 1 takes its first sample at 0.000102 seconds, whereas device 2 takes its first sample at 0.000104 seconds, simply because the crystal is different in both. These numbers are purely demonstrative, but the point is that if the samples themselves are not lined up to some reference point, then the two streams are shifted by a certain amount and you end up with crap like low-end rumble.
p2542
aVOhhhhh, shit that makes sense. So basically like beats between close frequency notes, but with sample rates instead?\u000a\u000aSo I'm recording:\u000a\u000aGuitar-&gt;Instrument cable (TRS?)-&gt;POD-&gt;USB cable -&gt;Laptop\u000a\u000aBasically I need to sync the laptop/Cubase and the POD?\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, how do I going about syncing the clocks haha?\u000a\u000aAlso, would this only affect the export, like what is happening, or would I hear it in the DAW as well?\u000a
p2543
aVOK, if you're going USB cable from the POD then that might change this. Does the POD show up as a sort of "fake", separate sound card on your computer when you plug it in? Then you select that sound card in Cubase? Or do you have another sound card that you're using in addition to the POD? If it shows up as a separate sound card and you select it in Cubase, you should have no problem with clocks needing to be synced, because technically you are only using one device in Cubase to record and listen back (the POD.) However if you are also using your main sound card in addition to the POD, you may run into issues. Before worrying about clock stuff, check the sample/bit-rate of the POD and match your Cubase project settings to it. It may be that the POD is recording in 48kHz and if you're recording/exporting in 44kHz you may hit issues there.\u000a\u000aIn fact... quoting the manual for this thing:\u000a\u000a*Sample Rate Converter Active:\u000aYou\u2019ll see this indicator light up whenever the\u000adevice is operating at a sample rate other than its **native 48kHz rate**. In addition to 48kHz,\u000aPOD HD supports 44.1kHz, 88.2kHz and 96kHz rates by utilizing an internal sample rate\u000aconverter. Please check your specific software\u2019s documentation for details on configuring\u000aits audio sample rate.*\u000a\u000aIt looks like 48kHz is the native sample rate. I bet that is your problem right there. Change Cubase to 48kHz and try an export and see what happens.\u000a\u000aAs for how to sync clocks, typically you need some sort of optical/coaxial connection between the two devices. I'm kind of thinking the POD does not require this. Typically synching clocks/crystals is only necessary on higher end, pro-level gear. I'm not really familiar with POD stuff. Does this device have any sort of firewire, or optical, or coaxial connection? Or anything at all other than USB or TRS?
p2544
aVSo much I didn't know haha. \u000a\u000aThe POD just shows up as a device and in Cubase I set the driver to the Line6 POD ASIO driver\u000a\u000aSo should I also change to *record* in 48kHz when using the POD? Because right now it's recording 16/44.1\u000a\u000aAlso, it only has TRS inputs, it has stereo XLR outs and one USB out.  \u000a\u000aI've tried going from the XLR outs to my Scarlett 2i2 to my computer through USB out, but I had just gotten Cubase and had issues setting up the inputs. Haven't tried again since, you think that might be worth it or pointless since the POD has a soundcard?
p2545
aVOn my phone have to be brief. Sample rates and bit rates need to be matched across the board on every single device. Yes Cubase needs to be matched to record at the same sample rate as the output of the POD which is 16/48kHz native. More later. 
p2546
aVAs for the XLR out into your Scarlett 2i2, it is something to consider. However you have to remember that every time you add a device to the chain, your signal quality inherently degrades.\u000a\u000aIf you are going POD -&gt; 2i2 -&gt; computer, there is almost two entire cycles of ADC -&gt; DAC (**a**nalog to **d**igital **c**onverter and **d**igital to **a**nalog **c**onverter) happening. The POD converts your pickup output (analog) into a digital stream, does the modeling, converts it back to analog (XLR output), the 2i2 takes that analog signal, again converts it to digital, does whatever it does, then feeds it to the computer via USB. I'm not clear on what the 2i2 does, it sounds like like a small 2in2out pre-amp interface or something?\u000a\u000aI would avoid it if you are using the POD. If the POD already shows up as a sound card that you can select in Cubase, and there is no functionality that you are missing that the 2i2 has, there is nothing to be solved by adding the 2i2 into the chain. However if there is something that the 2i2 does that the POD can't do, that you really want, you may want to add the 2i2 into the chain.
p2547
aVYeah that's what I figured about adding the 2i2 into the line, well at least about the signal degradation, didn't realize that it would be converting back and forth like that from the POD to the XLR.\u000a\u000aAlright, so I'll try recording in 16/48 soon and see if that helps!

asVFloyd Rose or Hardtail for lead guitar?
p2559
(lp2560
VI've been a die hard hardtail fan my whole life. After a while dive bombs just start to sound predictable. I do have a guitar though with a floyd rose and a locking nut, but the back of the bridge is bolted into the guitar body, so I don't actually use it, but the shit *never* goes out of tune.
p2561
aVYou know what's funny is my Ibanez RG has a FR and it still goes out of tune, albeit very slowly. I do a lot of solos with bends, so as the strings stretch out, I have to turn the fine tuning knobs to keep it in tune. Then at some point I reach the end of the threads and I have to unlock the nut and tune the whole thing again to reset the fine tuning knobs. So even that part is shit.
p2562
aVI mean occasionally I will have to reach down and readjust, but it's really really *really* stable.
p2563
aVThen a hardtail would be having the same, if not worse, issues.\u000a
p2564
aVAt least it's just a matter of tuning the knobs, rather than dealing with the locking nut and balancing the trem all over again.
p2565
aVPedals can divebomb and vibrato. Pedals can't make your guitar reliable. Hardtail is the way to go imo.
p2566
aVIf you're not going to change tunings often (or ever), get the Floyd. You can always block it off, plus you've got the option of using it for Floyd-y shit.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I can't stick with a tuning for more than a day so I only have hardtails.
p2567
aVThe tremolo is a whole other instrument.  If you're going to *play* it, please do so.\u000a\u000aBut, if you're just going to wank on it like you haven't gotten laid in a year, please leave it at home.
p2568
aVHahaha.. yeah I'd probably just wank it
p2569
aV[deleted]
p2570
aVIf you're going to use the Floyd Rose, try using it lightly on chords for a shimmery sound a la Rush's Red Sector A. That's a sorely underutilized technique.\u000a\u000aOther than that, I can't say much, as I'm a bassist. I have heard that having a ~~tremolo~~ vibrato bar makes one lazy on using "regular" vibrato (that is, with the fretting hand).
p2571
aVHere's how i see it. If this is your only guitar with a tremolo, go ahead and get it. The option to use it is there if you want to implement it, and if not, it's not like the guitar is going to be unplayable. Minor inconveniences like tuning and sustain are not going to ruin the guitar.\u000a\u000aI would skip the Floyd if you have another guitar with a tremolo though. It's a small feature that you probably only need on one guitar, so getting another will just cause more headaches when trying to set up.
p2572
aVSo yeah I have a low end Ibanez RG with a FR that I was planning on selling, but now I'm thinking I'll just keep both so I have that option.\u000a\u000aSounds like the hardtail is the way to go. That's what my gut tells me anyway.
p2573
aVFloyd Rose, I think, wins out for lead.  Especially if you want to get kinky and nasty with it.  The trouble that you've found and others have pointed out is they're a pain in the arse to change strings.  That can be remedied to some degree by switching out the stock tremolo for another one that takes the bullet-end strings.  The slot-and-go aspect of that kind of set up reduces at least some of the buggering about you've got to do with a standard FR.\u000a\u000a  [Example pic 1](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1435/1368796269_da587945b7_b.jpg)\u000a\u000a  [Example pic 2](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/FloydRoseSpeedLoader.jpg)\u000a\u000a  (I think it may prove less costly than pedals to do the same job for a fixed bridge.  Depends on your area and who can get on what I suppose)
p2574
aVup to you. If you like divebombs and vibratos and shit for you music, go for floyd rose.\u000a\u000aI personally hate the wankery, and I like the ability to tun my guitar instantly. Hardtail wins for me. 
p2575
aVWhat Floyd are you talking about when you say it stays in tune better and you have to tune it less than a hardtail?\u000a\u000aA Floyd is a floating bridge and any fluctuation in string tension affects the other strings tension. \u000a\u000aSustain on floyds can be fixed with a few mods - see floyd upgrades .com
p2576
aVI'm pretty sure the hardtail will stay in tune better. I have a double locking floyd rose, a (licensed) single locking F.R. and a bunch of hardtails and the hardtails always seem to stay in tune better. For me, its really about how bad you want to use the f.r. and if you are willing to deal with the tuning issues that come with it. If ypu really plan on using it, then get it. If you're not really sure, then get a hardtail. Or....  why not get both? Lol
p2577
aVReally? I thought that was the big draw of the FR is that it stays in tune better. F that then I'm going hard tail for sure
p2578
aVThe draw is that when you bend a whole chord, it stays in tune with itself. As far as I understand.
p2579
aVFloyd rose stays in tune better than any other tremolo maybe.\u000a\u000aEdit- also, the are different models of floyd rose, and there are "licensed" floyd roses that are a floyd rose design, but made by a knock off company. But even my real double locking floyd rose goes out of tune more than any of my hardtails. Especially if you do a bunch of crazy dimebag whammy abuse.
p2580
aVWeird, My floyd always stays in tune, and I abuse my whammy a lot.
p2581
aVIf you abuse your whammy a lot and you think its still in tune you are probably tone deaf.

p2584
aVA lot of guys get and subsequently block off Floyds and the like for additionally tuning stability. The issues only happen with significant whammy bar (ab)use or with lower-end trems.

aVDo people seiously believe that a floating tremolo can stay in tune better than a fixed bridge? I didn't mean to offend any f.r. users, I use them myself, and I know for a fact that a fixed bridge has more tuning stability and requires less maintenance than a floating bridge.

There are a few live vids from our first show just a few weeks ago up on youtube, as is the rest of the album. \u000a\u000aI have listened to metal for almost twenty years, and was a large fan of this project before joining, as the album, Becoming Flesh, is simply an amazing album. It's an honor to play with my bandmates.

asVVocalists, do you need to be drunk to record?
p2603
(lp2604
VGenerally, yes... I like to have a few beers before/during/after a vocal session. However, if it's gonna be a day long event, I find that the alcohol will tax my voice quicker (and perhaps an alcohol numbed throat makes me scream harder). In that case, I usually start the day with Arizona Ice teas... Weird, i know, but somehow I find it soothes my throat in a similar way to beer.
p2605
aVYeah definitely found that I hit like a... this is the best I've got and it was 10 takes ago moment.\u000a\u000aI'm a guitarist that's just trying to growl for the first time ever so I don't really know what the fuck I'm doing but it's sounding pretty great, luckily.
p2606
aVGetting drunk will loosen you up that's for sure, every vocalist i've ever seen telling people how to scream do not recommend any alcohol though.\u000a\u000aWarm up for a half hour and drink water is what they say.
p2607
aVIn addition, the water has to be lukewarm. Cold water will just interfere with the vocal cords, and hot water is a cruel mistress. Use some honey too, as it lubricates further.
p2608
aVYes, lubricate the throat hole...
p2609
aVNope.
p2610
aVIt's not just singing. A bit of loosening up helps a lot. Otherwise you can be too critical about your musical output, and cheat yourself out of giving your best. \u000a\u000aOverdoing the drinks would have the opposite impact of course.
p2611
aVNo alcohol or drugs- record early in the morning for best result.
p2612
aVNot if its gonna be a long day, you'll just end up trying to hard and being sloppy. though maybe the odd one here and there towards the end of the session. Energy, now thats what you need!

aVSome sessions "feel" better than others and I find that you get better results out of these, drunk or not.  Being wasted and making music is fun &amp; I bet its translated well on a number of recordings. I find that a little booze and smoke before playing helps (and Im a drummer/vocalist) but its a slippery slope because 1 too many beers (or highballs - i love whisky), and your performance, especially live, will suffer.

p2626
asVCan anyone teach me how to drums?
p2627
(lp2628
VThis is a really difficult question to answer. Many genres differ in their approach to playing drums, so how you approach writing parts depends on what's your style of music. In addition, drums rely heavily on feeling out the groove, so if you're relying on formulaic patterns, things might not work out so well. I'll try my best to give some general tips to get started.\u000a\u000aFirst, if you have absolutely no clue, start from the beginning and learn rock drumming and rock groves. The basic [rock groove](http://www.drumitinaminute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/straight-8th-rock-groove-a-and-b-combo.png) is just straight 8th note on the high hat, kick on 1, 3, &amp;(3), and snare on 2 and 4. This demonstrates some general principals of drumming:\u000a\u000a* The hi-hat maintains a constant beat that acts as a sort of backbone to the groove, similar to a metronome. We will call this the power hand. You will find that modifying the rhythm (quarter notes, 16th, triplets, etc.) can drastically change how we perceive the groove.\u000a\u000a* The kick and snare play out the groove, acting as counter points. The kick moves the rhythm, the snare emphasizes (notice the accent over 2 and 4)\u000a\u000a* The groove can be written out into 3 voices corresponding to each drum piece, and can be assigned a limb to play each part. This is important when writing out drum parts. Drum parts stop looking like a cluster fuck when you realize what limb corresponds to what piece, and then breakdown into individual voices. I find when i'm writing a drum part, i'll start with the power hand part (usually laying down a straight 8th/16th note on hi-hat/ride), followed by placing where i want the snare to accent the groove, and then finally adding kick in relation to the snare.\u000a\u000aAfter understanding the basics and applying to [similar grooves](http://0.tqn.com/d/np/drums/9781580628860_0150_002.jpg), start acquiring a repertoire of other well known grooves. Having an arsenal of rhythms that you understand can act as a starting point which you can tweak until it fits the song. In terms of metal, you should definitely have the [skank beat (or polka beat)](http://www.tigerbill.com/graphics/polka1.gif) and [blast beat](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/BlastBeatPattern1.jpg) down. [George Kollias has a good demonstration on these two grooves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDEA9Jy5VcA). Pay attention at the end when he takes his right hand out from playing hi-hat. Usually, since a straight blast beat can be repetitive and boring, drummers will remove the power hand from the hi-hat/ride and play a groove using other cymbals. This is one of the ways that you can incorporate crash cymbals into a song.\u000a\u000aI will emphasize again that your best bet for learning is to understand basic patterns, and use them as a basis for your drum parts. Seeing how you're using guitar pro, just grab some drum tabs from a song you like, and just copy and paste. I could try and go over more on cymbals and fills if you'd like, but this is already becoming a wall of text of me blabbering, so i'll leave this for now. 
p2629
aVI play guitar and bass, and this makes drums make more sense to me. Thanks man!
p2630
aVSome very common things: put the crash on the first beat of your pattern/riff, ride/hats/other cymbal on ever other quarter note or half note in a bar, snare on the second and fourth beat of each bar (or third of each bar for half tempo), every "and" (1 AND, 2 AND, 3 AND, 4 AND) for double tempo, and the kick drum following along with what the guitar bass is doing (either every single note or only to reinforce the important beats of the riff). Hope that helps you a bit. 
p2631
aV[deleted]
p2632
aVI actually memorized some guitar hero patters on the drums.  They sounded okay on the real drums and people actually thought I knew how to play.  
p2633
aVIts potentially acceptable to do anything that requires four or less limbs, but bear in mind the endurance of the drummer. Sure its possible to do a 16th note blast beat at 280 bpm, but how long could an actual person keep that up? The sky is the limit when creating new and interesting drum parts. Do anything that sounds good, as long as its possible its valid. 
p2634
aVI start out with a pretty simple approach when writing drums. I start with the kick, pretty much following the riff pretty tightly. Next I place the snare somewhere in the bar that fits the riff. The placement of the snare has a lot to do with the feel of the riff. Next I add whatever cymbal suits - the placement of these also change the feel of the riff, like the snare. Having a half-time snare (on beat 3) and half-time cymbals (beats 1 and 3) make it feel much different than cymbals every beat and a snare on beat 3, let alone on 2 and 4. Experiment with this - because why not?\u000a\u000aOnce I have this basic version of a drum track down - a draft, if you will - I listen to it in context and see where I can take it. The kick doesn't have to follow the riff - you can take kick hits out or add even more if you need. You can add more cymbals, add ghost notes on the snare and cymbals, and add fills. \u000a\u000aI find building from the ground up like this helps a lot more with drum tracks, as trying to tackle the entire drum kit at once can feel a bit daunting. \u000a\u000aHope it helps man! 
p2635
asVQuestion about strings
p2636
(lp2637
VIf your'e drop tuning that low you should re setup your ibanez because the intonation is probably gonna be way off, also the truss rod will probably need some adjusting. For drop C a setup isnt required, but is still optimal. Go with what string gauge feels the best, I use 11-49 with a floyd in standard and its too slinky on the bottom, try out different gauges and find the right one for the guitar and the tuning.
p2638
aVHow would I re-setup and adjust the truss rod?
p2639
aVIf you're planning to keep the tuning for a longer time and don't have much experience with setting up guitars i would see a professional to do the work. If you do have experience you can look up intonating and truss rod adjusting on google, but the jist of it is intonation- how the guitar is tuned with itself, determines if the fretted note is exactly on key or slightly but noticably off. Truss rod is a rod that goes through most of the neck and controls the bending of the neck, most truss rods can go both ways- adjusting the truss rod helps with intonation and action and also makes sure that the neck isnt overly bent. 
p2640
aVI'd probably do a 13-62 set for Drop A, and 12-60s for Drop C on the epi - it's got a shorter scale length so you'll need to compensate. Otherwise I'd suggest 11-56s. 
p2641
aVDaddario's 11-56 pack is my favorite thing in the universe. I use them for drop B on 25.5" scale and drop C on 24.75" scale. Also I use a 64 for drop A on a 27" scale and it feels great
p2642
aVI usually like a slightly lighter top... if they made a 10-56 set I'd be stoked, that'd be a solid match for my preferences in D Standard.

aVIt's all perspective. To me this IS a light top after playing on 12-52 for a year haha. Having a 4th wound is magical though.

p2670
aVSure thing!  About 2 months ago, I switched over to Reaper for my DAW, and it's really amazing, considering the price.  The guitars were recorded using my POD HD, via USB.  It's the Treadplate (dual rectifier clone) with soundgate &gt; tube screamer (75% output, 0% gain) &gt; soundgate &gt; red comp &gt; Amp.  Of course, 2 guitar tracks, hard panned left/right.\u000a\u000aNow, for the bass, I cheated.  I took one of the guitar channels, and copy/pasted it into a new track.  Then I ran the Cockos pitch shift plugin to drop it an octave, then threw an EQ on it, boosting the bass frequencies.  \u000a\u000aDrums were done by hand using Reaper's inline midi editor, and the kit is a modified version of Frederik's Bleed Kit preset in Superior Drummer 2 Metal Foundry.\u000a\u000aAnd then on the master effects channel, I'm running the FabFilter Pro-L vst plugin, using the "Metal - Natural Loudness" preset, with the overall volume boosted 3 dB.\u000a\u000aAll the guitars were recorded with an Agile Intrepid 8-string.  I absolutely love it, though I've got some new, heavier gauge strings on order for it, and I still need to take it in and get it completely setup.
p2671
aVI just switched over to Reaper too(not like I really knew how to properly use any DAW to begin with), do you have any tips or tricks for someone getting started with Reaper or in general?\u000a\u000aI'm stealing your bass idea. That never occurred to me. \u000a\u000aOh, and most importantly, that song rocks. Thanks for posting it.
p2672
aVThanks!  I'm glad you liked the track!  Feel free to follow my SoundCloud page, as I upload stuff to it pretty frequently, and have a back catalog of demos I've done.  I'm actually working on my debut solo album "Entrancer", which I hope to finish later this year.\u000a\u000aAs for Reaper, the best suggestion I can offer is to play with it, record demos, and just expirement with the program.  I've spent countless hours at my computer with my axe on, just recording random stuff, and playing with the individual tracks to see what can be done with different VSTs, virtual amps, etc.  There's also a ton of tutorials (both written and video) out there, and just watching them can help you understand different aspects of the program you didn't realize were available to you.  I'm a computer enthusiest (and work as a R&amp;D lab technician), so I enjoy screwing around in reaper for hours on end, though sometimes it drives my girlfriend insane, haha.

I'm still trying to get better at mixing/mastering, but I think this is my best attempt to date. I just need to get a bass.
p2677
aVYeah, I think a bass track would definitely fill out the mix!  You could try some limiter plugins to help up the overall volume a bit.  I like to use FabFilter's Pro-L on the master VST chain.  Like I explained before you could make a cheater bass track using a pitch shifting plugin to drop one of your guitar tracks an octave and boost the bass frequency with the EQ on the track.\u000a\u000aI've used the Le456 before, with LeCab and an orange cab impulse, and gotten good results for guitars.  Part of my overall tone is also the use of a tube screamer in my effects chain with the gain at zero, tone at 80%, and output at 75% to add a bit more bite to the channel before it hits the amp.  I'm also using an 8 string with passive pickups, so that definitely adds to the beef of the guitar sounds.

aVI rarely listen to metal. Not to say that I don't like it. The vocalist sounds like he's dealing with a phlegm issue. From the metal I've heard it's supposed to be growling and deep. I don't know if that's what you guys are going for. You guys should probably have your vocalist see a specialist to know if he isn't going to sacrifice his voice before you guys get to an album. There's an up and down side to this: he may, physiologically, never be able to growl in a way that's satisfying because growling isn't really special, just like pop singing you have to be within a certain range to do it; or he has vocal chords that can take a beating. I'm a novice but maybe once he has the fear of going deeper into the growl conquered he'll sound less like an actual teen.

I still have a spider II 1x10 combo in my bedroom just for noodling around, and my roommate has a spider 3 1x12 combo in the living room just to have something to throw ideas out. You can get some awesome sounding tones out of them with the right amount of tweaking. Just use your ear. Whatever sounds good to you, use it.  And yes, fuck the haters, hahaha. I use a 5150 III 50 watt head for our band, but always come back to the spider's for keeping my chops up between gig's and band practice.      
p2703
aVThe best tones you could possibly use are the ones from the Slipknot presets.  You can modify them to sound like what you want if you need to.  If you're not getting tone out of it, press the dial button in and move the d-pad over 3 spaces.  Then move down until you see tone and turn it up to like 90.  It obvioully gives it more tone/thickness.  The amp works best without a lot of mids.  Killswitch engage works well too.  
p2704
aVI've got the Spider III HD150 head. I'm using a B-52 cabinet, the 480 watt one. The high end tone from the Line 6 and the deep, low end of the B52 make a beastly tone. Incredible mid range. I'm hoping to upgrade soon but this head has been a solid piece of gear.

asVhow da shizz do you tune a 5-string bass to accompany a 8-string?
p2766
(lp2767
VI would tune up to C#F#BEA, Dick Lövgren tunes up in Meshugga rather that tuning down to F like the guitarists &amp; it sounds fine.
p2768
aVHe does this, but with the low string down to a B, if I'm not mistaken
p2769
aVI used a 5 string in a band where the guitarists had 8 strings. I had to find .135 gauge strings and have the bass set up to tune low enough the strings don't flip around. 
p2770
aVTune up, or get a longer scale bass (or at least longer on the bass side - think Dingwall, 37"-34" fan or something) and use heavier strings (Kalium makes 'em).\u000a\u000aDon't worry about tuning up vs down having an effect on how "heavy" the sound is - Periphery tunes down and Mehuggah tunes up, and I can tell you which is the heavier band pretty easily ;)
p2771
aVYou've got that backwards- Periphery tunes down and Meshuggah tunes up. Bass-wise, at least.\u000a
p2772
aVShit I flipped them around. My bad. I was thinking the right thing, though.
p2773
aVI have the same problem. I used to turn up to what would be drop A, and just not play in open.   But I got smart and strung a 4 string baritone, which works much better. 
p2774
aVwoah. that's smart. \u000ait must be a cunt to play though
p2775
aVTune your 8 string down a half step and tune your bass up a half step. They'll line up nicely.\u000a\u000aF Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb &lt;= 8-string\u000a\u000aF Bb Eb Ab &lt;= 4-string bass\u000a\u000aAlternatively you could just tune your 8-string down a whole step and leave the bass in standard.\u000a
p2776
aVWhat tuning do the guitarists play in? If it's anything lower than F#, I'd tune your bass in unison instead of an octave down. An interesting mod you can do to help thicken your tone and be more up-front in the mix, is to add a second output jack, and run one output with some light overdrive or distortion, and run both outputs into your rig. You can also use a signal splitter into two rigs if you don't want to mod your bass.
p2777
aVIn all honestly, I typically tune basses up from E to F#. But I'm just a guitarist...
p2778
aV[deleted]
p2779
aVDepends on how you want to do it. I'd just tune the bass down a whole step for extra low notes. And find the low notes of the guitar on what would now be my D string. If you want to tune really low like the guitar, get a bass with a longer scale to increase tension.
p2780
aVMatch your 8 on the top 4, drop the fifth. Example: F# standard, tune your bass to B#F#B#EA so you can go down an octave under the 7th string but you can match on the F#. For Drop E on an 8, just go in BEADG. I hope this helps
p2781
aVTell your guitarist to stop it. 8 strings is silly. 
p2782
aVIt's really not, it can definitely broaden your range if you can adapt to the extra strings as well as know at least some basic theory and scales/modes
p2783
aVThis. If TechDeath or metalcore, just leave the band. If Progressive, get a sixer and leave it in standard. \u000a\u000aRemember, guitars work exactly like basses do in extended ranges. Both of you can keep standard tuning, and it'll sound just fine. \u000a\u000aShit, I have a 5006E in E (EADGCf#) to accompany my girlfriend's standard six MLX. Sounds amazin' when harmonized. 
p2784
aVi'm not asking for wisdom on the virtues of different genres, i just want to know what tunings are usually employed. meshuggah seem to get on just fine with a 5.
p2785
aVThey also play open and 1 a lot, being djent. \u000a\u000aWhich in that case, you're just playing percussion. Who cares about tuning after that. Just overdrive it, fuzz it up, distort it, compress it, and rob it of all the treble possible. 
p2786
aVOP, this is exactly what you *shouldn't* do.
p2787
aVBelay that, OP. This guy has no idea what I'm talking about. 
p2788
aVNo one has any idea what you're talking about because it's classic TE trying to troll. You can't even do that half-well - pathetic. \u000a\u000a

aVI'm not trolling. I'll troll stupid threads (DAE PAUL MAKARTNAE), but this? This needs attending. 
p2790
aV&gt; This needs attending. \u000a\u000aI'm sure everyone is waiting on bated breath. 
p2791
aVIf your problem is the low string why would you spend so much money to get a bass with the same tuning but with an extra higher string. Why not get a longer scale neck and put it on your current bass. Or if you're not into that FIND THE NOTES ON YOUR FRETBOARD!!!! Seriously so many of these comments telling you to tune up?! You know you don't have to play the same frets as the guitarist as a matter of fact you don't need to play the same part as the guitarist. I say either stay in standard or tune a whole step down. You don't need extra strings or to tune up. Just find the notes on the bass!!! Sorry for making this so long and mean sounding but I really just wanted to get my point across since it seems that everyone else is giving the same bad idea.

p2793
(lp2794
VI'm not a real life drummer per se, but I do have superior drummer 2.0 with the metal foundry and all that stuff, and I'm pretty good at making drum tracks. I can play the drums, I just don't have a set. If you wanna do dumb and goofy, I'm more than down, and we can make tracks that are absolutely insane with blast beats and doing stuff that a drummer probably couldn't even really do lol. \u000a\u000aIf you're interested PM me or something and let's see what we can do. I can send you some tracks of stuff I've done with superior and my little set up at home. 
p2795
aVThat'd be good. I've thought about programming but o find it to be a chore and not enjoyable.  I make music to have fun I don't want it to feel like work.  The project I have on Monday is called ground chuck and I wanna call it carnivorous death grind.  Songs are gonna be all about how gross disgusting and delicious eating meat is.  Very tongue in cheek.  I've got some riffs and lyrics ready need some drums figure it'd be fun to put on band camp and piss off some over sensitive became.  So if that does not offend your sensibilities we could try it out.  Let me know.
p2796
aVYeah I've been doing the programming thing for about 4 years now, so I've got it down to a science, and I think I'm fairly good at it. I've been looking for a project too. I'm always working on my own stuff and writing and what not, but I find working on other stuff with other people also helps me in my own writing and stirs up my ideas and creativity a bit, so I'd be happy to work on this with you because it's quite a bit different from what I normally do, and I'm all about having fun with it and making music just for the sake of making music. I was in a serious band for a really long time, and these days I just like to make stuff for the hell of it. \u000a\u000aAnd none of that stuff offends me or anything like that lol. I think it's an interesting/funny concept and I'm more than down dude. If you want to PM me your email or something, I can send you some tracks of stuff I've done later this afternoon once I'm home from work. It's not grind stuff, but it'll show you some of what I can do with drum programming. Honestly, making grind/blast beat type stuff is easier because blast beats are a lot of cut and paste and just changing the velocities on certain things, so we can make it happen for sure, and I'm sure we can make something pretty interesting. We just got to stay committed because I know a lot of people try this online stuff, and the interest falls off once people start lagging.

asVtips for an aspiring vocalist? (death metal, black metal, grindcore)
p2835
(lp2836
VBasically put, most vocals (screams included) are going to sound like shit without proper processing. \u000a\u000aWhen I record vocals, you have to have a good mic (condenser is my preferred), a good room to dampen the excess reverb, and multiple takes to get the correct sound. On top of that, you'll want slight compression to keep your vocals more even in wave form. You'll correct the rest later.\u000a\u000aThen you'll want to further compress, at a higher ratio 8:1 to 16:1 (tweak to your preference) and bounce the track through. Then to give it further volume you'll need to eq it. This will be a whole other story. Cutting low ends (30hz and below), and the far high end (20k plus isn't needed), while boosting mid to high-lows. Somewhere between 250 to 500hz.\u000a\u000aThen slight room verb to fill it up some more, and some slight chorus. Maximize, and compress, and presto. Vocals. \u000a\u000aOh, and lest I forget the most important part. DON'T CLIP (when the audio level goes above 0db). Clipping does not sound good under any circumstances, and will render that entire take useless. \u000a\u000aSo long story short, it's not as simple as plugging in and screaming. There are a ton of factors that go into it.\u000a\u000aFeel free to message me with any questions. 
p2837
aVso if I've already recorded through audacity is there any way I can modify the present vocals to sound good? 
p2838
aVAs long as you didn't clip. Audacity should have a compressor built in. Look up a tutorial online for it. 
p2839
aVCould you give any examples of your vocals, as well as a complete rundown of your signal chain and rig? The voicelive looks interesting for doing live gigs, but for recording, i would personally record dry vocals and then add processing afterwards in my DAW.
p2840
aVI'm a huge noob, I'm afraid I don't recognize most that terminology ^^;\u000a\u000aThe mic is plugged into the voicelive which is connected to a peavey 2x14(?) amp, the recordings are done via usb. 
p2841
aVThe signal chain is basically everything you use from the instrument to what's recording, so essentially that was mostly what i needed to know. If you can share the mic model, that would be helpful too.\u000a\u000aThat said, i think the main issue here is using the peavey amp as a recording interface. I'm going to assume it's a guitar amp with a usb output that you hook to your computer to record. The problem here is that amps with these features need to simulate being played through cabinet speakers, so that someone recording guitar via usb doesn't need to mic up their amp. Your setup now theoretically is your voice to mic, through voicelive(negligible), through an amp (colors the signal), out through cabinet speaker (simulated, also colors), back through a mic (also simulated and colors), and then to your computer. Vocals need to be as direct as possible when recorded. The signal chain should essentially be your voice, to a mic, through a recording interface, to the computer. Unless your voicelive has a usb feature, or the peavy has a bypass feature, you're going to be stuck with a PA sound issue until you upgrade to an interface.\u000a\u000aAs for tips on singing, giving an example of what you can do would be helpful in critiquing and possibly pointing you in a right direction. Otherwise the best i could do is explaining how i, as an amateur, approach singing and recording metal vocals, which may not be relevant to your style.

I like that. \u000a\u000aI don't particularly dig the guitar tone you are using. You're also playing to the original tune, which makes me unsure of what you are playing vs the original recording.

Reddit is full of Tool material, because they are amazing etc. \u000a\u000aI would prefer to see what original material you have, OR, a full cover of Vicarious. \u000a\u000aThis of course, would require finding a drummer willing to cover the material as well. \u000a\u000aAlso a vocalist.

aVI play in a progressive metal band. I used to own a bugera 333xl which i lost in superstorm sandy. At the time i was in a thrash/groove metal band. It was a good amp. My first tube amp in fact. It had its quirks like the low end on the lead channel can over bearing at times. It can also be very noisey on the lead channel. The cleans were ok. Never needed or used the crunch channel. I really liked the amp but decided to go for a different tone after the storm. For about the price you would get one new you can get a used 5150 or 6505+

asVQuestion about squealies
p2903
(lp2904
VThat is a pinch harmonic, also called a false harmonic.  You're activating a harmonic node along with the original pitch being fretted, same as touching the string lightly at the twelfth fret.    The guy who explained it to me basically told me to "stop playing like a pussy - dig in".  What he meant was the need to pick deeper into the string and catch a bit of it with the flesh of the topside of your thumb between where you grip the pick and your thumbnail.  Envision it as a little shovel,  digging out a tiny hole-that visual seems to help some of my students who are having issues with it.  They may also be juicing it with a wah or whammy. It's certainly mixed  so that it's prominent,  but you can get them to speak loud in performance without them.  To my ears, it doesn't sound particularly wha or whammy-ish.  At the end of the day, focus on your timing of brushing the string with your thumb immediately after the pick hits. Keep at it - good luck! 
p2905
aVThank you for the help!
p2906
aVNo problem!
p2907
aVIf I asked my guitarist to "make a squealie" he'd probably fart.
p2908
aVA number of things can make pinch harmonics easier like overdrive, hot pickups, etc.. however ultimately your technique is going to be critical.\u000a\u000aThe metal soloist commonly grips the pick with only a small amount of the pick's tip protruding from the edge of his thumb.\u000a\u000aYou'll find its more of a wrist rotation than anything else, where the edge of your thumb brushes the string after pick contact.\u000a\u000aI've found 7th fret on the G string (and really the G string in general) is very responsive to pinch harmonics, so that may be a good place to practice. \u000a\u000aYouTube probably has a metric butt-load of videos that can illustrate this.\u000a\u000aGood luck on your journey to metal mastery.
p2909
aVSounds like you have step 1 down which is making the actual harmonic. If you don't then you just need to choke way up on a small thick pick and find the right place to hit the string to get a clear pinch harmonic going. Then to get that "squealy" sound (lol by the way) you need to get a super fast super exaggerated vibrato (bending and releasing string quickly) going on. Tuning down or using lighter strings helps with this part. No Whammy effects or anything, it's all just high gain and vibrato on a pinch harmonic.
p2910
aVYou need super wanky vibrato to make them pop like that.
p2911
asVChurch Of Misery - Candy Man (Dean Corll) - My Bass Cover
p2912
(lp2913
sVWhat does my doom tone need?
p2914
(lp2915
VNobody has said cowbell yet? I'm going with cowbell.\u000a\u000aNo, but in all seriousness, a bit tighter and longer distortion. Also the bass could be a bit heavier/darker.
p2916
aVOkay. What do you mean by that? Like I know the distortion breaks up a lot on the chugging parts but how do I dial in a tone that doesn't? When I play out of my amp it doesn't sound like that, but gooing line in into my computer records a muddier sound.
p2917
aVUnfortunately I'm not an expert of any sort when it comes to audio production, so I have no idea how to achieve it. What I mean, I guess, is you could try and get the sound to last a little longer to get a bit more "doomier" feeling to it. Maybe some plugins can help with achieve that?\u000a\u000aLike I said, I know jack shit about these things, nor the proper English terms for any of it, so this probably isn't very helpful. I'm just a vocalist who shrieks and growls when needed.
p2918
aVHow are you recording your guitar? Are you using any type of interface or are you literally using 'line in'? If you're running like a 1/4" cable from your amp to your computer's 1/8" mic in, that is probably the culprit. Especially if you're using active pickups. \u000a\u000aHowever, if you're running your guitar directly into your computer, I'm actually pretty impressed. I used to do that and I found that my guitar sounded fuzzy.
p2919
aVNope I've got a pre amp but basically yeah the unprocessed signal gets thrown straight onto Audacity. I took everyone's advice here though and redid everything with it, it sounds unrecognizable. Good EQ and compression, and some ambience VST's can come pretty close to making up for having an awful DAW haha.
p2920
aVMids are your friend. Some more mids in your guitar (maybe just a tad more bass too) will fatten it up significantly while still allowing it to cut through. More mids will make those chugs sound way bigger too. Cutting mids on a bass is a mortal sin in my opinion as well. \u000a\u000aOne question, what are the chords being played between the quick melodic licks in the intro? My ear is bad at deciphering distorted non-power chords still.\u000a\u000aCool riffs though, I really enjoy this.\u000a\u000a
p2921
aVTuned to C (I think?) so here's a tab for the bottom two strings.\u000a\u000a\u000a    F   5-7---7---7---7---7---7---7---7-\u000a    C   ----0-8---8---4---4---3---3---3-\u000a\u000a    F   5-7---7---7---7---7---3---3---3-\u000a    C   ----0-8---8---3---3---1---1---1-\u000a\u000aSo C is the tonal center the whole time the way I hear it. The intervals in the chords would be a major third down, a minor sixth down, a major sixth down, and then of course a power chord on C#, the minor 2nd in the scale of C.
p2922
aVI like the progression a lot. Thanks!
p2923
aVAnd is everything mixed well etc? Thanks.
p2924
aVPretty cool! I just think when you play the chugging type part it could use more low end, but not so much that it makes the instruments muddy. Just a tiny bit more. Kind of the same thing with the whole song. Some suggestions for achieving those kinds of sounds would be to turn the tone knob down on the bass, turn down the treble a little bit and the bass up on your amp (also do not scoop mids. Seriously first mistake any metalhead makes when EQing), use the bridge humbucker on your guitar. I'm actually pretty curious what gear you use.
p2925
aVLess bass, more mids, play the riff 4x times (not copy/paste) 70% left, 70% right, 100% left, 100% right\u000a\u000aPlay the riff twice somewhat clean &amp; twice the way you have it. When you blend it all together it'll sound sick. 
p2926
aVThanks. I quad tracked this. Twice with a muddy and grungy distortion and twice with a gnarly and scratchier heavy distortion. One of each got panned to the left and right, but on one side the gnarly one got a high shelf and on the other the muddier one got a high shelf. Also on each side one was panned 100% and the other like 70% but idr which ones got which. You're saying what I should do though, is record two tracks with distortion and two tracks with a cleaner tone? And should the high shelf always be on the outside and bigger tones more near center?
p2927
aVYeah man, the clear tone will make your tone sound unreal. Keep the cleaner tones at 70% pan. 
p2928
aVAnd the distorted ones 100% L/R should be the high shelf? Should they be as loud as the other ones or quieter?
p2929
aVCheck out this video: http://youtu.be/L6PHzkPjH7c\u000a\u000aIt goes over those details
p2930
aVlol someone just posted this in this subreddit recently. I did take your advice on the center tones, I got an Iron Horse distortion going in on low dist and high tone mid level volume, it's cleanish but the chugs are tight as fuck, then I just put the gnarly stuff on the outside, it just sounds like one big slab of doom!
p2931
aVI like the mixing, I'm not a big fan of the snare. I think you need a looser, more "thud" like sound to it.
p2932
aVSounds sweet.
p2933
aVI think the bass could be alittle bit tigher and more defined, but that's about it.
p2934
aVI actually think you could make it a bit more loose.  Add some more bass, and a lot more mids.  Also, if you're thinking of buying a new pedal, maybe think about getting a phaser.
p2935
aVYou actually don't want more bass. You want to make sure you're leaving sonic space for the rest of the band. Remember that. A lot of people spend a long time chasing a bedroom tone and then find that it doesn't work in a band setting. 
p2936
aVWell, that could mean a lot of things though. It could mean a more audible bass, or a smoother bass. It could mean more bass frequencies or a louder bass guitar. I think I've successfully made the bass better after re-working it. It is more noticeable and easier to follow, and blends well with the guitars without sacrificing rumble and good old fashioned doominess.

V* Sleep when you can, where you can. \u000a* Get a Nalgene water bottle or something similar. Water is free and important to your body. When you run out of money (Which you will) - a good reusable water bottle is nice to have.\u000a* Depending on climate, pack accordingly. Don't just bring shorts and tanks for a tour that might go thru the mountains. Bring a hoodie and jeans.\u000a* Roll on de-oderant or shower in a bottle. Life saver\u000a* Baby wipes, seriously nice to have around\u000a* Bring a pillow and a blanket\u000a
p2944
aV* Bring something to do in the van, books are good.\u000a* Bring ear plugs and use them.\u000a* When you arrive at the venue, don't disappear. There's work that needs do be done, do your share. Also, if you go somewhere, tell someone where you're going and how long you expect to be back. Take your phone and answer it.\u000a* Tours are a lot of waiting (in the van, at the venue, at the hotel or wherever you sleep), have something to occupy your time.\u000a* Be willing to compromise with your band-mates.\u000a* HAVE FUN.
p2945
aVBasically what everyone else has said.\u000a\u000aBeen respectful to the other bands you are playing with. Sound check at 6? Be there for 5:30, new strings, tuned up and ready to go. And you know that new song you guys have been working on? Y'know, that one that kind of trails off after the bridge? Yeah, don't play that song at sound check. Play your most proficient and tight song.\u000a\u000aTime wise, work out your set to give you roughly 5-10 minutes before and after to factor in your stage clear off. \u000a\u000aMost importantly, enjoy it.\u000a\u000aThe first tour I did was around your age, 17. I had a miserable time. Didn't know what to expect really, totally unprepared. Thankfully now I have quite a bit of experience.\u000a\u000aSo in terms of being prepared, you gave us very little information on your band but this is some overall generic advice from a guitarist point of view.\u000a\u000a* Bulk buy a box of strings not sure where you live but I use Strings Direct in the UK. Or drum sticks if you're a drummer\u000a\u000a* Same goes for guitar picks. Or drum heads.\u000a\u000a* I'm not sure if you'll have a guitar tech or whatever but bring a small tool kit with. Nothing fancy, some small screwdrivers, pliers/wire cutters (for cutting the ends of your strings when you replace them.. or doing your nails. Whatever), duct tape (show saver for me once).\u000a\u000a* Depending on your pedal set up, bring batteries. At least 2 for each pedal. Yes, even if you have a power brick or some other power device for them.\u000a\u000a* Be nice to your sound guy. I would say buy him a beer but given the age that will be an issue. Seriously though. He is your last line of defence in regards to not sounding like shit. Don't turn your amp up unless he tells you to. By all means dial in your tone but leave the volume levels alone. Just because you can't hear it properly behind you on stage doesn't mean it doesn't sound good out front. If you're struggling to hear yourself, your vocalist, whatever speak to him about turning up the wedges. \u000a\u000aFuck, I could go on. I'll leave it for now. Hopefully you have enough now to get you going!\u000a

aVEveryone has good tips, but some additional ones and I will highlight other important ones:\u000a\u000a* It's not all fun and games; it's A LOT of work\u000a* But still, have fun\u000a* Sleep when you can or you will get sick\u000a* Bring some MRE's, Ramen Noodles, or something of the sort. There may be days where you WILL be hungry and have no money or time to eat\u000a* Water. For fucks sake. Bring a water bottle. A bobble or Brita bottle is good if you end up in areas with poor water conditions.\u000a* Not sure the popularity of your band, but don't be surprised if you're up early doing signings, interviews, promotions, etc. Again, highlight sleep if this happens\u000a* Shower when you can since it will be infrequent\u000a* Pillow and a sleeping bag/blanket\u000a* Books, Nook, or something. There may not be a lot of waiting around time. But it's boring as shit between cities\u000a* Can't highlight this enough: Be nice to your sound guy if you're not doing it yourself. Their attitude can affect how awesome or shitty you sound.\u000a* Bring extra everything! Extra guitars (or drum heads), sticks, picks, dicks, etc.

p2984
(lp2985
VNOTE: I said "first legitimate track" because this is our first track that isn't just a guitar track or a jam track. This is our first song with bass, drums, and proper mastering and mixing (though it is my first attempt at that, so do be gentle).\u000a\u000aUPDATE 1: fixed the solos and some off-sync rhythm parts. Link is the same.
p2986
aVI can hear the click of the kick, but the bass lacks presence. If you haven't already, try sending the bass to a second track and put on a R.A.T. distortion or a guitar amp or something. The kick click also sounds too "airy"- if you boosted the upper range somewhere, try shifting the frequency and finding something more palatable, probably higher up in the register. Make sure you cut other instruments in that area to carve out a spot for it.\u000a\u000aThe guitar tone sounds great, but they're played somewhat sloppily; make sure you've reduced latency as much as possible and always record to the drum track, and then listen to each track individually with the drums and do some editing if need be.\u000a\u000aThe vocals need work. Sounds like you used quite a bit of distortion and reverb. I would reduce the amount of distortion and the wet-dry mix of the distortion to around 15-35%- it just needs to be a hair. Then turn the reverb room size and wet-dry mix down so it gives the vocals some air. You shouldn't really be able to hear the actual reverb reflections in the mix itself when all of the instruments are playing. :)
p2987
aVThanks!\u000a\u000a1. There is actually a 2nd bass guitar track with added distortion, but the reason it "lacks presence" is because the double-tracked bass was a bit too loud in the mix, so I turned it down a little. \u000a\u000a2. I see. Tell me where you feel our playing got sloppy and I'll go back and rerecord it.\u000a\u000a3. The problem with the vocals was that while I did the whole song in Reaper, my friend (Hersh) was using Garageband to do the vocals because he did them separately at his house. But I'll ask him to send the raw MP3 file without reverb.\u000a\u000aEither way, thanks for the advice.

VTo record guitars straight into a computer, you'll need either a digital effects processor, or a USB interface (which you'll also need for mics). If you go the processor route, I'd recommend getting a used Line 6 POD X3 off of eBay. If you go for the interface, I'd recommend a Behringer UM2: great sound, zero latency, and only $50.\u000a\u000aFor recording programs, I'd recommend Reaper: it's free, and is just as good as most professional DAWs out there. And if you go the interface route, you'll need plugins to get a kickass guitar sound. I'd recommend the following combo: TSE 808 (screamer) + Poulin SoloC (amp) + Poulin LeCab (cabinet).

aVThis is pretty much what i'd recommend, maybe pick up a cheap version of cubase if you can. The 'vintage' range of free vst's are pretty good, and there are a ridiculous amount of free plug-in instruments should you need them. Also, if you can, compress EVERYTHING on input, even just a little bit, you'll thank yourself for it when it comes to mixdown. 
p3012
aVReaper isn't free. They give you a free unlimited trial, but if you like it and continue to use it, you really should buy a license. It's only $60, and in my opinion worth way more.
p3013
aVReaper for the work station and pod farm for guitars 
p3014
aVThis is the slightly illegal approach, but my brother and I torrented Logic 10, then bought Joey Sturgis's impulse drivers and mixed the real drum samples they have in Logic for a metal sound. \u000a\u000aWe bought all our hardware though; the USB interface, compressor, and all the other stuff you need. 
p3015
aVHow is logic 10? Is it complex or a heavy learning curve? 
p3016
aVLogic is basically the simple version of Pro Tools. Pro Tools does more, but it's also a shit-ton more complex. Logic is fairly basic and does everything you essentially need to record music. \u000a\u000aMy brother just watched a bajillion videos on it. That's literally the only way he learned and we've been producing professional sounding music for a few months now
p3017
aVReaper is the way to go for your DAW. I'd recommend spending a little extra and trying to find a used Pod Hd500. It's well worth the money as a reliable piece of gear and as an effects processor with endless possibilities. In terms of drums, I'd say get an electronic drum kit and superior drummer 2. That way your drummer can play through those samples. Or skip the kit and just program drums if your drummer is cool with not playing his actual parts on the demo. For vocals, any condenser mic will do, I've got a Rode NT1-A that I highly recommend for both vocals and acoustic instruments. Lastly, get izotope Ozone 5 if you want a professional sounding demo. I would also recommend a solid interface, you'll need it to record vocals. Can't go wrong with the Scarlett 2i2. All in all, this would run you around $1,000, assuming you already have a computer that can handle all this. It's well worth it if you're serious about music and want to pursue it.

asVAre lyrics welcomed here? Here is an entire albums worth.

(lp3020
VThey don't really have anything to do with WWI.  It's like you are describing a photograph from WWI that doesn't have any detail... much of what you are saying could be referencing any generic battle.\u000a\u000aI suggest you do some research and start from scratch.  You need to elaborate on the basic ideas you have presented so far.  Look for creative ways to discuss specific WWI issues - gas attacks/masks, trench-foot, wounds/injuries, deserters/executions, fear/mental health, shellshock, military structure and ranks, misleading propaganda, the sounds/sights/smells... rather than simply referencing their existence as you have.  Maybe even go as far as researching language and colloquialism of the time/country in question to pull your listeners away from the impression that you are simply describing a photograph in 2014.\u000a\u000aI'm definitely interested to hear the final product though!
p3021
aVThanks for the constructive criticism, lyrics are a new-ish thing for me. I'm also taking a different approach to the music in that the lyrics are written first.\u000a\u000aWorking on imagery is never a bad thing.
p3022
aVLyrics first is my favourite way to write!  Setting music to an existing text is so fun!\u000a\u000aI recommend [this book](http://books.google.co.nz/books/about/A_Glossary_of_Literary_Terms.html?id=MGkzngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y) or something similar to skim through when writing lyrics... you will come across lots of interesting ideas to give your writing an intelligent edge.

VI would normally criticize the subject matter of your lyrics, but it really works with the sound of the song.  Also, I'm in process of writing a deathgrind EP about a hungry walrus, so who am I to judge?\u000a\u000aI like the riffing, tone works well for it, it's good stuff.  Equalization on everything needs a bit of work, just to bring out the lows, make everything sound a little less flat, y'know? And watch those high notes on the vocals. Overall though, good song, I like it.

sVVocal advice?
p3031
(lp3032
VBest advice I can give is if you are new to vocals, regardless of the style you are doing take vocal lessons. I'm a metal vocalist myself, mainly doing melodic but I do I growl and scream for effect.  I took vocal lessons for opera to primarily work on my strength and breathing technique. I wasn't able to growl and scream right away, but I was able to build upon the operatic techniques over time. \u000a\u000aThere are a few good dvd's, I think on of em is the Zen of Screaming or something. Worth checking out!\u000a\u000a\u000aGood luck! :)
p3033
aVJust started myself, I was going for a more poison the well scream but that aside, the best advice I can give is to force yourself to do as much clean singing as possible. A half hour to warm up before harsh vocals and daily as an exercise when you're going to work or wherever you find some time. It really works even though it doesn't sound as fun.\u000a\u000aHope this helped.
p3034
aVJust practice. I'm just starting to get my sound with it, and you need to warm up and not be drinking or eating anything other than water. Also, you will sound a lot different in a mic.
p3035
aVKeep in mind, above all else, that you're growling from your diaphragm, not your throat, and that if your throat really starts hurting, you stop and try again later. Properly learning metal vocals isn't overly damaging to your throat but fucking up on the way can be. 
p3036
aVWarm ups are necessary. Learning to constantly use your diaphragm takes work. And above all else practice, practice, practice. Don't try to sound like your favorite singer. Trying to sound like someone else fucks you up. Just be natural. Let it come to you, don't force it.

aVI've always wanted to add drums, or even remake the theme from the Tim Burton Batman. Basically the bit in the Batman: Animated Series intro.
p3044
aVabsolutely!!! its Danny Elfman that inspires the strings and the choir for this song and i try and write like how John Williams would for an epic battle. 
p3045
aVNice. For some reason, I was obsessed with Elfman's score for Sleepy Hollow for a long time and wanted to add some metal drums to part of it. Maybe I still will. I recently got some V-drums and am looking for excuses to record them haha.
p3046
aVdo something you want to do and make it sound awesome for you! then others will like it. (its like people know when your forcing it or enjoying yourslef) Elfman and Williams are my 2 favorite film score writers they inspire probably more people than most bands now a days tbh. record that sleepy hollow and send me a link!!! 
p3047
aVMaybe I will. It's been a while since I've listened to it. I'll try to map out a part sometime. Someone on YouTube tabbed out the batman intro for piano, and I tried to translate it to guitar, but I didn't get far. I'm not a guitar player though.

p3056
aVThe production needs a little help, but I think you've got some promise.  My first advice would be to ditch Reverbnation in favor of Bandcamp.  Reverbnation will try to get you to commit to paying for bullshit extra services, and isn't taken very seriously by booking agents &amp; promoters.  Are you a performing band, or is this primarily a songwriting exercise for you guys?
p3057
aVWe want to eventually perform but are currently without a bassist and don't have the vocal equipment we need. As for improving production quality, it's a new learning experience for us doing it all ourselves so the more we learn the better we get! I am also looking into buying an Avid Eleven Rack which comes with Pro Tools 11 which should also be a major help as we are currently using Reaper. In this recording, a friend recorded us on his Axe FX 2 but we were very limited on time so this is the product of about 5 minutes of playing with the tone and 3-4 hours of recording. And thank you for the tip, we will definitely make a bandcamp! We just made the reverbnation because it syncs with facebook and made it easier to share with friends. Thank you so much for the constructive criticism (rather than just saying we suck like that other guy haha). This is really helpful advice, you're awesome! Have a nice day! 
p3058
aVBandcamp also integrates with Facebook.  Having used both bandcamp &amp; reverbnation, I can assure you that reverbnation offers very little that bandcamp can't.    \u000a\u000aI know that recording everything yourself sounds appealing, but a professional recording goes a very long way.  My advice would be to hone your chops live as much as possible &amp; book some studio time with a legit engineer.  Dave Otero runs Flatline Audio (look him up) in northwest Denver, and he's made tons of amazing metal records, including stuff by Cephalic Carnage and Cattle Decapitation to name a few. Don't worry about having the right vocal gear to gig-  every legit venue in Denver that hosts metal has a PA.  For a practice setup, a cheap option is to purchase a keyboard amp with an XLR output jack, and just sing into that.  My band is on our 3rd record at this point, and we still use this cheap-ass setup for practice, so don't fool yourself into thinking you need to invest thousands in a soundboard just to practice with a singer.  \u000a\u000aCheers, &amp; good luck!
p3059
aVThank you so much, this is all really good advice! If you don't mind, what's your band's name? You've been really helpful, and i'd like to give it a listen and support your music!

aVFor sure. I see where you're going with it,  but the song definitely would benefit from a real drummer. Any plans on doing a full blown release?

aVNot exactly sure what you mean by full blown release but possibly.
p3069
aVComplete and finished, to be downloaded,  sold, distributed etc. As opposed to unfinished,  work in progress, or unmastered.

aVOh I see. I don't have any plans for it in it's current state but I would be willing to go through the process of getting to a more finished state if you were down to do some drums for it. If it seems like something you'd enjoy doing drums for then I could put the extra work for the track, but if it's not your thing then no worries.

The band's I do like usually have really good clean production.\u000a\u000aProbably the only two bands I really like in the genre are Borknagar and modern Satyricon.

p3088
(lp3089
VI think it likely depends quite a bit on where you are located and the studio ( equipment and experience with similar bands ).\u000a\u000aI think generally it seems to me that for a "decent" product I expect around $200 / song. That would be recording, mixing and maybe light mastering. Full-on mastering is a whole different beast that traditionally costs more and uses different equipment than a standard recording studio will have - though these days you can frequently get a pretty good master by just using things like Ozone.\u000a\u000aI would recommend saving up and doing your research on the studios you're looking into. In my opinion, it's a complete waste to spend any time and money on a cheaper option if you dislike the end product. If you're not happy with it and proud of it, then it will be difficult for you to sell it to other people.
p3090
aVYou really should just call local places and ask about their rates and what all is involved.  Definitely shop around.  Ask local bands where they have gone and what their experience was like.  Do not overlook places because they have non-metal bands in their client list.\u000a\u000aMany pro studios where you go in, set up your gear and record and mix charge per hour.  But are flexible to alter pricing if you want to reserve an entire week/month or however long you need.  (you can do this step yourself actually...but it's much less of a headache to simply go to a studio imo.  They are pros at it, and experienced and unless you are too...you wouldn't be asking this).  Economically and logistically speaking it's best to go into this with 3-4 or more songs.  It's a waste of time to go in, set up gear, record and mix, and break down after just 1 song.  Drums are time consuming and more involved to set up and mic properly.  Ideally you want to get all the songs done in one session for the sake of the drums alone.\u000a\u000aMost mastering houses charge per song.  With limits based on the length of the song.  For example if you send them a 16 minute song then they'll up the price.  Definitely shop around for mastering.  Listen to their samples.  Some even master one of your songs cheaper so you can get a feel for what the end product will be.\u000a\u000aFrom there you can pick a service that will follow through with pressing and all that.  Or you can DIY.  I've always done pressing myself.  Basically after I get mailed the masters I send it to a pressing house to make the CD or record.  If you are pressing records expect a 3-4 month lead time.\u000a\u000aThere's also studios that do the entire run from recording to mixing to mastering.  IDK what their rates would be like but I expect it would be equivalent to...how good their service is, and how much of their time you are buying.\u000a\u000aFWIW my last 13 track album I spent about $700 overall.  3 other band mates also dropped about as much money too, we tried to split it up comfortably.  That covered recording in the studio, mixing in the same studio.  Mastering somewhere else.  Pressing onto CD (qty300) somewhere else with a digi pack that had 6 pages of sleeve art (3 inside, 3 outside).  I wanted to go with a digi pack that only had one panel, but the other dudes voted for 2 panel so there's that.
p3091
aVAll depends on the studio. My band recorded our three song demo for $375. $125 per song. That was only for recording, mixing and mastering. We did the rest ourselves. There is another studio around here that I know the guy charges $500 per song. He has a much bigger studio with bigger equipment and I think that includes sending it to discmasters for print.
p3092
aVLow rates I've seen are around $75 per song with as high as going about $500 or $1000 for high-end studios. 
p3093
aVWe just released our 11 track full length. This one cost altogether $5000, including mastering. We pressed ourselves. Bit on the pricey side, but for 12 days in a high-end studio, with mastering, it's worth it. We recorded at a studio many bands that have influenced us have been recorded, and we got what we payed for. That was mostly producer time in that figure as well. He improved our sound, made changes to the music here or there, and added sounds to improve it and make it feel like a full album. We also got to record through some badass, and for my amp at least, rare equipment. We wouldn't have thought to use an accordion in a song either, that's for sure!

aVI've always been a Jackson guy myself.  [The soloist](http://www.jacksonguitars.com/en-AU/guitars/soloist/models/usa-sl2ht-soloist-ebony-fretboard-black/) with the string through body has a certain drool factor for me.  I have however been a convert of Gibson the last few years after picking up a flying V for cheap because it had a mild paint scratch on it (no one would touch it because of a mild imperfection).  It's well balanced, stays in tune even with my heavy handed picking style and sounds great even with just the stock pickups in it.

aVI love the bridge on my Ibanez fr2620. They still make the FR1620, if you're looking for a higher end guitar.

aVIf you're into playing floating bridge guitar already and wanna stick with that there are good options for metal guitar in higher end price ranges that won't so readily detune. Gibson explorer is an obvious one, but for more of an ibanez sound peavy makes one under the model name EXP with tuning locks on the neck that's badass.

VI have no experience with this stuff, sorry. However, your band is awesome! Consider me a fan! I'll be buying a copy of your album when I get paid. Does it support you guys more to buy a physical copy or just the download? Anyway, sorry I couldn't be of more assistance.

aVGlad you dig it! Any support is good support, so I'd certainly recommend the physical copy so you can get the nifty artwork and booklet. We probably profit more from downloadable purchases, but there's nothing like a physical copy for sure.
p3145
aVWow, good question.  I don't know either but expect that's something I'll run into when my band releases an album... assuming it's any good and people are interested in it.\u000a\u000aMy own thought on this is that you should send them a free lossless digital copy and nice high-quality images of the album art, lyric sheets, band photos... essentially a "press kit" in a zip file.  That way they can't complain that the audio isn't high enough quality to review properly and you don't have to pay tons of shipping costs.  I suppose some could take offence and call you cheap, but I would think they'd understand that most bands aren't rich and need to be frugal, so who needs those guys anyway?
p3146
aVYeah we're in a weird time were we're using both physical press kits and e-press kits. That's a good idea though.
p3147
aVIn my experience, I always ask for a physical copy to review but I always leave it open for the artist to send me a download instead.

aVIt's not weird to request, it is sort of a bonus of spending the time to right up a proper review and market their website/blog etc. \u000a\u000aConsider where the request is coming from. Do their reviews include the packaging details - cover art, lyrics, etc? Do you think they will generate sales, either digital or physical, for you?\u000a\u000aIf you like the person's style, respect their reviews and think they can get your music out to people who wouldn't otherwise hear of it, then it may be worth it to send a physical copy. You can check the popularity of a site/blog a variety of ways - look for page ranks and backlinks. Check twitter followers, etc.
p3150
aVYeah most of them have been a lot smaller and have seemed kind of boilerplate, like not so interested in us specifically as much as the chance to maybe get a free cd or just any band to expand their publication. That's really a good point though about their time spent being more-or-less a trade in services. Thanks for the reply!
p3151
aVI don't have any personal experience with this but here's my 2 cents for what it's worth:\u000a\u000a- I don't think it's strange for them to request a copy of the album for free. In their minds they're providing a service to get you free promo so they want something they can use to get your music out there.\u000a\u000a- Whenever possible, I would suggest sending a download link to the album for free. If you've got several formats available through bandcamp downloads that's the perfect way to do it so they can get whichever works best for them.\u000a\u000a- If they absolutely need a physical copy, ask them if they'd consider sending a UPS label. Then all you have to do is drop it in a padded envelope and send it off at their expense (minus the envelope).\u000a\u000a- If they're not willing to pay for the shipping and just have to have a physical copy (for whatever reason) then it's really up to you. Take a look at what their reach is and how many potential fans you'll be reaching out to. If you decide you really want to do it and are going to pay shipping, consider requesting terms of your own before sending it off. I don't think it's too unprofessional or unrealistic to ask for x radio plays/week or some sort of cross promo online for reviews. Featured posts on popular review sites and facebook can go a long way if done correctly. It all matters on how much pull the publication has. When you're talking to Revolver magazine there's almost no question, lets send out a copy. But some college blog may not have as great an impact.\u000a\u000aRemember that it's all up to you. It's your music and you can promote and release however you like.\u000a\u000aNinja Edit: You might also consider putting together a press pack for the album with a download link, band photos, and copies of the cover/album art so they can really push it. Consider newspapers - a shitty article with a great photo will likely get placed first before a great article with no photo.
p3152
aVThanks for all the thoughts! That's a good point about asking them to send a label, kinda gauging how serious they are. It's been pretty much all really small radio/review sites with small readerships, and the messages have all been kinda boilerplate, so it's been tough to gauge if they're just browsing bandcamp every day and sending these things out en masse, wanting free stuff, or are truly interested. I'm not so worried about cost as it is just getting ripped off or copyrights stolen, or I guess just a general paranoia due to being new at all of this. I definitely like your ideas though, as they kind of 'vet' the asker to see if they're genuine or not. Thanks!

aVSorry can't help...BUT\u000a\u000aHoly crap do I love the color palette / cover artwork/ and logo of your band. Music is good too!
p3154
aVYes, it's common. Most of these people aren't being paid so this is their perk of the job. The problem is, few of them appreciate that every CD we give away loses us a future sale and costs something up front too. On top of that, a bunch of these sites are just vanity projects with a handful of readers.\u000a\u000aMy policy is to give physical copies only to print media, with exceptions made for online media outlets where I'm confident they have a large readership.

VDrums are too loud, vocals sound like they were recorded in a bathroom stall, the guitars are too thin, and I can't hear a bass because there isn't one. Make the guitars sound thicker, pull the vocals forward, and turn down the fucking kick drum. \u000a\u000aDecent tune, though.
p3158
aVthe drum sounds like it's the main part of the song. It's good and I like it but it needs to be pushed down ever so slightly. \u000a\u000aCrisper guitar might do the trick too. Other than that it's cool!
p3159
aVEdits I've made so far:\u000a\u000a -Compression on the rhythm guitars\u000a\u000a -No more reverb on the vocals\u000a\u000a -Compression on the vocals\u000a\u000a -Turned down the drums a little bit and turned down the bass freqs on the drums since I can't individually turn down the kick\u000a
p3160
aVNothing seems 'off' to me - vocal performance seems ok, just not a great mix job, on the whole. If I had to improve those vocals I'd be automating the levels to get the volume consistent, making them louder on the whole, adding more compression, and probably dialing back the reverb a notch or two.

sVWriting 2 guitar parts that go well together?
p3164
(lp3165
VOkay so you seem to be aware of how strictly harmonic lines work, for example one riff played with the same riff a third higher. This works because each interval ends up being consonant because you specifically wrote it to be - for example guitar 1 plays C-E-F-G-A and guitar 2 plays E-G-A-B-C at the same time. All of these intervals are either minor or major 3rds which sound pleasing to pretty much everyone. \u000a\u000aAssume now you wish to have guitar 1 play the same thing, but guitar 2 play a completely different (rhythmically) line at the same time. You have to make sure the intervals are still consonant (for the most part) for it to sound good. Lets say guitar 1 still plays C-E-F-G-A and these are all eighth notes. If guitar 2 wants to play two quarter notes and an eighth note, you have to make sure each quarter note is consonant with the 2 eighth notes guitar 1 is playing. An acceptable solution may be G-D-E. The G makes a perfect fifth with the C and a minor third with the E, the D makes a minor third with the F and a perfect fourth with the G, and the E makes a perfect fourth with the A. \u000a\u000aObviously this is much more complicated in practice, because you'll have complex lines that may not be as easy to harmonize, especially when you add complex rhythms as found in most genres of metal. Often you won't be writing in a clear cut minor or major key and you'll have to be inventive. However, the key to success is making sure the majority of the relationship between the two riffs is consonant - or at least that the important parts are. You should be able to play each individual interval one at a time and like how it sounds - if you don't, it won't sound good when you add rhythm either.

aVI suggest learning how chords are constructed, not just triads but the whole deal with 7's and higher, sus chords, etc. You should explore modes and scales after, but not before. There are many ways to write leads and harmonies. Consider techniques like counterpoint. \u000a\u000aAnd don't just narrow yourself to the guitar. Don't forget bass exists and you can use that to your full advantage. I kind of dicuss some of these points here:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDTaTGAAHU
p3169
aVI think that's most composers dilemma.  The only way to solve it is to keep trying.  You'll figure it out eventually.
p3170
aVThe lower one you would probably approach more as a bassline and can even simply have it mirror the bassline itself.  It's obviously going to be a rhythmic part.  Which means it's going to need to interact well with the drums.  You'd write your "lower" riff with the bass and drums.  I'd even say write whatever this lower riff is on the bass first.  \u000a\u000aThen write your melodic lead part separate from that.\u000a\u000aOr were you trying to do a counter-melody with the lower part?  That's a bit out of my experience to explain because I've never done it.
p3171
aV&gt; my impression is that guitar harmonies have the exact same rhythm on both guitars and only the note pitch varies\u000a\u000aNo, harmony is simply the concept of multiple notes playing at once. Many harmonies played on guitar have the same rhythm for both parts but it's not necessary and it can sound pretty boring that way.\u000a\u000aGenerally speaking, you need to understand scales. Once you understand scales, and know which scale you're in, then you can build simple harmonies based on the scale. The simplest one is to do what are called "thirds", so-called because they include the 1st note in the scale and the 3rd - or, the 2nd and the 4th, the 3rd and the 5th, etc. The traditional Iron Maiden/Thin Lizzy stuff is basically a lead line with a 3rd harmony stacked on top. Lots of melodeath bands also use 3rds in their riffs - not typically on the bass/pedal notes but on the accented higher ones.\u000a\u000a(A third harmony is basically the first part of a typical chord triad, so knowing your chords helps here too.)\u000a\u000aThirds aren't the only harmonies you can use - they're just the most obvious. You could use seconds, fourths, fifths - the only issue is that sometimes they sound dissonant, depending on where they are in the scale. That may or may not be a problem, depending on how long you play them for and what the context is.\u000a\u000aIf writing parts where the notes overlap (ie. they don't have exactly the same rhythm), you just need to consider each change in note a new harmony. If you're playing an E and a G (a 3rd, in E minor) and the G rises to an A, that's now a 4th. etc.

p3213
(lp3214
VNice tutorial, thank you very much. Just a thought: especially with metal bands, one should keep in mind that the band will most likely be expected to play the song live. So either make sure that they have the gear needed and it can be setup in reasonable time span, or refrain from using plugins or editing for "special effects". A signature sound you can't reproduce is rather haunting for a band, i can imagine.
p3215
aVMetal can be hard to get to stick. Always comprimising, and when it comes to fast drums (like the blastbeats of tnbm) you will end up choosing either hear the double bass drums or the sharp drum machine gun fire. Cause both wont fit !! Sound is Krieg !! 
p3216
aVIf this track is any indication, don't take any advice from this guy about mixing a snare drum
p3217
asVAs an experiment I tried making a doom metal song entirely with garageband (no actual instruments). What are your thoughts/opinions/comments?
p3218
(lp3219
VDamn the guitar sounds great, to the point it almost sounds like it's being picked. The drums are okay. Cymbals sound find, but that snare is so dull. And the bass could be thicker. Basically some EQ magic would go a long way.\u000a\u000aI wouldn't know how to make the snare "bite" more, but the kick could be stretched out with a bit of reverb.
p3220
aVNever realized how realistic their guitars were. But as far as comments on the track, the second riff seems to really drag being repeated 4 times instead of perhaps twice. Doom metal is far from a genre I have any expertise in, so maybe I'm wrong in saying that because you very well may be going for that droning vibe that it creates. Nevertheless, interesting track! Keep pumping them out and they'll progressively keep getting better and better. 
p3221
aVThanks. When I was making the track I was focusing more on trying to get the guitars to sound natural and less on the actual song-writing. To get the "double tracked" effect on the guitars I had to mess around with the distortion settings so that the one on the left side had a slightly different sound than the one on the right. Then I basically copy-pasted the riff from one track to the other and manually moved each note around so that all of the "strings" would sound like they were being struck at slightly different times. \u000a\u000aOverall I don't really like using garageband's programmed guitars since I can only make it sound realistic in this style of the longer held-out notes, and any sort of palm muting effect is impossible (or at least more trouble than it's worth to try and achieve). That being said, I'm pretty happy with how this track came out. 
p3222
aVYa, it's not hateful by any means (as in "not bad"). From my experience, if you want any palm muting on synth guitar tracks, you have to make it its own separate guitar track that just handles the palm muted notes. Not very practical or efficient, but if you're going for realistic, that's about the only trick I've found. Hell, the same goes for pretty much any different technique on a guitar; you have to set up a new guitar instrument/track that gears the settings toward their respective sound.

aVAlright, I just woke up and I'm gonna put in a fresh pot of coffee. I hope you like death metal. 
p3300
aVWord. I'm at work for the next eight hours, so I won't get a chance to jam on it until tonight. 
p3301
aVCool beans, by the time you get off I'll be heading to work lol. So once you get it, if you can jam and record something and get it back me before you go to sleep (I'll probably be up to at least 2am, my sleeps cycles all fucky) I can probably have the whole thing finalized before the week is up. It doesn't have to be perfect, but I want to kind of go for a Dethklok kind of approach: silly song themes and ideas and lyric, but serious music as a whole. 
p3302
aVRight on man. I can't promise that I'll have something finished tonight, but I'll try. 
p3303
aVAlright. I'll post the song on here when I'm done. 
p3304
aVhttps://soundcloud.com/christophersmith-15/untitled-w-click-track\u000a\u000aAlright, I kinds just threw this together. I figured i'd keep it short and simple. I included a click track because I thought it would help. I can see a lot of lead parts being awesome in this. It's in 4/4, 175bpm. Let me know if you need anything else. You should be able to download straight from soundcloud. Let me know when you do so I can delete it. 
p3305
aVOk cool. I'll take a gander when I get home. I figure something simple would be best to start things off. 
p3306
aVAlright cool. 
p3307
aVI like it! I've been jamming on it for a bit, but I haven't recorded anything yet. I'm still new to using Reaper with my electronic kit, so I'm trying to get the drums to sound right. Is it cool if I speed it up a bit, maybe 190ish? 
p3308
aVYeah, go for it. I can downpick up to about 220 bpm so I can handle that. 
p3309
aVYo, I should have something for ya tomorrow. I didn't have much of a chance this evening but I'm free tomorrow. 
p3310
aVAlright good stuff. I should be finishing up a project tonight or tomorrow sometime then I can go straight to this again and probably get some lead guitar work going. 
p3311
aVhttp://m.soundcloud.com/txmmiller/untitleddd \u000a\u000aThere's a stab at it. It's flubby and there are part I'm going to change, but it's something to start with. I imported the track into reaper at 175 bpm, but kicked it up to 190. There's a drum-only track on there too. I'm new to recording, so let me know if the mix sucks. 
p3312
aVMan that was the shit! Oh god I'm about to jam out tomorrow. I may need to actually go out and buy a bass because I can see this being a fun little project. \u000a\u000aI just listened through it real quick before hopping in the shower so I just played it through my phone. So I'll just worry about mixing later, right now I gotta worry about practicing! Gotta get them palm mutes to sync with the double pedal, then we'll be talking. 
p3313
aVRight on. The guitar work seems pretty dang tight, so if anything isn't syncing, it could be the drums. \u000a\u000aOne thing that I can't figure out is how to get my ride cymbal to 'ping' loud enough to hear for blasts. I only have two cymbal pads, so I'm fairly limited. I plan on grabbing a third soonish though. 
p3314
aVOkay I actually do have something to ask of you. In terms of mixing, I actually like the sound a lot, but I was wondering if you can make the kick drum pop just a little bit more? It already sounds really good tone wise, it's just behind the mix a bit. If you can raise it, and may EQ it a little, if that's possible, it will be perfect. I can worry about how it sits in the mix with everything else later. 
p3315
aVYea, I noticed the same thing when I played it on different speakers than my computer's. I think lowering the low end and kicking up the highs of the kick drum might help it punch through. I'll take a crack at it after work. 
p3316
aVYes, this so much! I think that's all it'll need.
p3317
aVRight on. 
p3318
aV[Here ya go.](https://soundcloud.com/txmmiller/sets/asfd) Is that any better? I updated both versions and set them for download.
p3319
aVhttps://soundcloud.com/christophersmith-15/untitled\u000a\u000aHere ya go. I made the guitars way more tighter and I threw some harmonies in there (the part after 1:00. :D I love it). I'm gonna work on some lead guitars tonight but I prolly won't be done until sometime tomorrow. Maybe even after work.  But, I should be able to come up with some good stuff. 
p3320
aVVery cool. It sounds good on my phone. Can't wait to check it in my car 
p3321
aVYea that part after 1:00 is pretty rad. This is shaping up nicely. I spent a little time tinkering with the drum mix and I think it sounds cleaner. I brought the cymbals and low end of the kick back some and it's made a difference. 
p3322
aVAwesome. I'm going to try to invest in a bass soon to see about getting that laid down. 
p3323
aVWord. I've been trying to get my hands on one too. Pretty much all of my ex-band members that played bass sold all of their gear. How am I supposed to borrow their stuff if they sell it? It's just rude.
p3324
aVHa, yeah. I used to borrow a friends' bass but his older brother took all their basses when he moved out. Which is stupid, because no one in that family plays bass anyways. \u000a\u000aAt the closest pawnshop near me though, they have a really sick looking 5-string for 100. I want to get it, but I'm currently having my cash sapped from me and my job just notified me that theyll be docking basically $200 from me, so I'm not happy about that at all. Because they still owe me a check for about 800 :/
p3325
aVUgh that sucks. I'm still in debt to Guitar Center for my gear. Luckily we aren't on any schedule, so I'm in no rush. 
p3326
aVOh did you finance with them? I really want to finance a new guitar. 
p3327
aVYea, they had a 18-month no interest deal happening, so I got one of their cards. It's dangerous though. I went back a few weeks after and couldn't resist buying a Pod for my guitar. It's hard not to go back and get more stuff.
p3328
aVLol, I can imagine. The only thing I need is a new guitar and new cable. Then I would be set. 
p3329
aVWhat kind of guitar are you looking at buying? About a decade ago I bought a basic PRS (ce22 I believe), and I love it. I'm not very good though, so I just mess around on it. 
p3330
aVI want 2: Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro Ebony and Schecter Omen with active pickups. The Les Paul goes for about 500 and the Omen for about 300. 
p3331
aVI just googled those. The Les Paul looks sexy.
p3332
aVThey both sounds amazing. The Les Paul will be perfect for leads and cleans and really anything that needs to sound beautiful. The Omen is a beats for rhythm. It's easy to play, but it's still a very solid guitar. I can play fast riffs on it all day with easy. Unlike my current gear which need over 200psi for each damn downstroke to get a good sound lol. 
p3333
aVWell, for what it's worth, what you've recorded sounds tght and crisp.
p3334
aVThanks man! That's why I want a new guitar so bad, take my skill to the next level. 
p3335
aVWhoo! That's killer! I'm about to have so much fun with this. Sounds perfect. I'm about to work on this now. I may have all the guitars and stuff done by tonight if not earlier. So I should have something back for you to listen to later. 
p3336
aVSweet. Let me know if you need any specific changes to any parts. 
p3337
aVI play guitar/bass for like 10 years and I'm looking to do the same thing. What kind of stuff do you like to play?
p3338
aVAnything rock/metal oriented, but nothing too technical. I grew up listening to, and playing, punk, but as I got older I got more into metal. I'm really not picky. I like stuff from all over the rock/metal spectrum. The Bronx, The Armed(Spreading Joy EP), Rotten Sound, Kill the Client, some Thrice, Cave In(White Silence), and a lot of common favs like BDM or Mastodon. I'm not limited to stuff like that; those are just some bands off the top of my head that I'd consider some influences. 
p3339
aVI probably should mention that I'm not into anything djent related. I just never could get into it.
p3340
aVDOOOH wish I knew you two months ago, I just finished a grind album inspired lb Rotten Sound.

aVSweet. Anything online? It's been two-or-so years since I've played anything 'extreme' on a regular basis, so two months ago I would have had to practice a ton to get my chops up!

asVHow loud do vocalist actually get?
p3353
(lp3354
VI know some can go really really loud. I think it was the vocalist of Pig Destroyer who broke his mic on stage and then screamed over the entire band without a microphone. Pretty incredible actually, I'll see if I can find it.\u000aBut to answer your question more generally, most vocalists are at about shouting level. Some slam/bree kind of vocalists are really quiet though.
p3355
aVYep: http://youtu.be/2BdP6lI6kqc. Dude's a fucking monster.
p3356
aVshieeeee
p3357
aVholy fuck thats fucking insane
p3358
aVoh my god i can just imagine that headache.
p3359
aVAs a metal vocalist myself, my voice is "loud."  the pig destroyer vocalist is going to destroy his body doing that. the hardest part of false chord/metal singing is air control. not to hard, not to soft. it's a little similar to an "outside voice" maybe louder, but not by a huge margin.
p3360
aVYeah I'm a vocalist too and I know that. I don't think he does it all the time though, I think he did it because the song was very short and his mic was broken.
p3361
aVI think it varies from person to person. That said, no matter how loud you scream you're not going to outmatch a guitar amp, and those don't shatter car windows. The sound coming out of the PA when a frontman is talking in between songs is already a lot louder than any vocalist I know of could project without amplification.
p3362
aVWell, when I'm doing vocals it's like shouting or yelling in volume. Easily drowned out by an amp. 
p3363
aVThere's a limit to how loud the vocals can be from the speakers when playing live: if they're too loud you're going to get [audio feedback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_feedback) (e.g. singing \u2192 microphone \u2192 speakers \u2192 microphone again \u2192 speakers again and so on, leading to a terrible noise). That's one of the main reasons why the vocals are usually very low during live performances.\u000a\u000aNot really what you asked for, but I think it does explain a part of your post.

aVDon't most people today gate their mics though?
p3366
aVIf you pass the threshold of the gate that doesn't matter.
p3367
aVIt varies a lot depending on what sort of voice you are using. I mean, I find I can get some of my roars pretty loud, but not too loud to do in my room, but I can easily get a strong belted note or heavy metal scream to be far too damn loud for a small undampened space. Seems to be this way in most vocalists I know. I also find that most people have some parts of their roar/scream range be much louder/quieter than others, everyone's voice is different.\u000a\u000aOn stage all vocals should be gated/compd, so you can't really tell, its brought into level with the rest of the band so the vocalist is in their comfort zone (or at least it should be that way in the mix).

VFIRST QUESTION: does your guitar have new strings on?
p3408
aVNo. haven't changed the strings in a few months.
p3409
aVThat's probably a fair part of it, new strings really help, especially when recording direct and using VSTs.\u000a\u000aAlso, I think your guitar tone is perfectly usable, but if I were to change one thing I'd go with less gain. It's pretty saturated, which isn't always the best thing.\u000a\u000aAnd by the way, trying to sound like someone else isn't the path to finding your own musical voice; it'll be a good starting point and idea source for tones and techniques, but ultimately your own ears and tastes should determine what you use. Don't sweat that it doesn't sound like the video if it's still good.
p3410
aV&gt; trying to sound like someone else isn't the path to finding your own musical voice\u000a\u000aI definitely agree with that. I've been playing and writing music for more than 10 some odd years. It's only recently I started trying to record and set up a little home studio. If i've realized anything it's that production is immense. I'm just trying to use these videos as a starting off point. I realize at some point I'll feel comfortable trying different cabs and settings, but for now I'd like a little but of structure in terms of learning.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately there's no book entitled "learning to produce metal with vsts". I would totally own that book otherwise.\u000a\u000aPerhaps I'm being hard on myself, but I hate feeling like if I could do it better than I should do it better because I really enjoy this. The problem just seems to be that the information is kind of hard to come by. Like I have no idea where in the chain I need to make adjustments and otherwise I feel like I could spend hours turning knobs wondering wtf I'm doing lol. I've certainly considered upgrading my guitar or getting a better interface, but if it's unnecessary I just want to figure out what I'm screwing up.
p3411
aVHonestly, as far as making adjustments in the chain, add and adjust  one thing at a time, and start with the things that most directly affect your tone. So, as far as the VSTs go, start adjusting the amp sim first, for example. Most of the gain and tone shaping happens in there. Once you have that sounding good, try out different impulses, because no matter what you're going to use those. Once you're happy with one of those, if you feel it needs more tightness or edge, back off the gain on the amp Sim and then put the pedal before it. Adjust only that until it sounds good. If you're less happy while it's on, then it's better to not have it. Same with EQ. If you don't feel the EQ adds anything special, leave it. \u000a\u000a(While we're on EQ, [this](http://youtu.be/gdB9iamvk08) is how you subtractive EQ. Use a narrow boost to find a frequency that you don't like, then cut it. It's honestly the best way. And again, if you can't find a frequency you need to remove, you don't need to remove anything.)\u000a\u000aBut yeah. The basic principle is to make the biggest changes first, keep them, then make more specific adjustments and additions until you're pleased. I hope this is helping.\u000a\u000a
p3412
aVDefinitely :)\u000a\u000aThanks!
p3413
aVNo problem! Feel free to message me or reply if you ever want to ask anything. 
p3414
aVI tried using some of the feedback I got in here. I think it helped and it sounds a little better. Idunno what do you think? https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/hibria-master-2
p3415
aVWell I definitely think it's better! Nice work. Keep at it!
p3416
aVGood. The best strings for recording are dead strings. Seriously.\u000a\u000aI read an EVH interview ages ago where he said the title track to 5150 was recorded on a Flying V because it was the only guitar in the studio that day with dead strings. [You can hear it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxHAN6JIkNo)
p3417
aVCrank up the mids. A scooped tone will almost always sound flat in my experience. For amp eq, I usually go about 5 bass, 9 mid, and 8 treble. Also a little less gain on the amp and a little more volume on the OD pedal; maybe even consider reducing some drive on the OD pedal. A double tracked tone will sound far clearer and sharper with less distortion. \u000a\u000aAlways experiment with new VST amp/cab plugins as well.\u000a\u000aAlso, consider using a compressor before the OD pedal. Personally I use Guitar Rig 5, but I'm sure you can find free compressor plugins that will work nicely. Your EQ looks pretty good, maybe consider a little boost in the 1-2k range, not much but just enough to give it some sparkle. \u000a
p3418
aVThis. More mids, slightly less treble than you think you need, way less bass than you think you need (that's what the *bass* guitar is for).\u000a\u000aAnd the OD advice is good too. A little gain on the amp (think over-driven Marshall). Same with the OD, give it a little gain, but crank the volume. This gives you a very dynamic tone with huge amounts of gain, yet clarity.
p3419
aVAwesome. I played around with this a little and i noticed a big difference. Thanks a lot!\u000a\u000a2 questions- when you say reduce the amp gain you're referring to the pregain on the X50 right? And I've heard about using compression, but I've never heard about using it at the start of the chain. I think I've only heard about it used at the end after EQ. Am I wrong?
p3420
aV&gt; when you say reduce the amp gain you're referring to the pregain on the X50 right?\u000a\u000aYes... amp, simulated or real, reduce the pre-amp gain. Honestly, you could probably put it on 3. On the OD, max the volume, put the gain/drive at say 9 o'clock, and the point the tone towards the volume for starters. Adjust as necessary.\u000a\u000a&gt; And I've heard about using compression, but I've never heard about using it at the start of the chain. I think I've only heard about it used at the end after EQ. Am I wrong?\u000a\u000aI don't know about recording... but for guitar signal, you want compression first - if at all, otherwise you risk compressing the life out of your sound. This may be over simplification, but compression will flatten your sound. You want the effects (gain, distortion, reverb, delay, whatever...) to liven up your sound. You don't want the compression to squash all that.
p3421
aVYeah, the pre-gain. I'm not familiar with the X50 but I believe the post-gain is just volume essentially. \u000a\u000aCompressors can be used anywhere and have an effect, but when used on the clean signal (at the start of the chain) it will act towards equalizing the volume for all sounds. This is desirable for things like harmonics and not so desirable for things like line noise. I usually use noise reduction before a compressor to make sure anything less audible than, for example, a squeak when sliding from fret to fret does not come through into my signal. Then the compressor boosts and equalizes everything volume-wise, which makes your tone a bit fatter and makes things like harmonics come through clearer. Experiment with the compressor controls until you find a sound you like; I usually don't crank it up very much, just a little compression does the trick most of the time.  \u000a\u000aIn addition, I often use EQ after my compressor instead of at the end of the chain. It has a far more drastic effect on tone when a clean signal is running through it, and the amp EQ shapes the tone more at the end, which I personally prefer. But these choices are obviously up to you, and if you like the EQ or compression at the end then go for it. You could even have two EQ's or compressors doing slightly different things if you want.

aVJust Nick has a [great video about compressors for guitars](http://youtu.be/hMSCKz4GRZY). The talking starts at the [1 min mark](http://youtu.be/hMSCKz4GRZY?t=1m).\u000a\u000aHis main points, compressors\u000a\u000a* reduce attack transient and therefore presence in the mix\u000a* make the signal "darker"\u000a* even out and "tighten" the volume of the signal\u000a* increase apparent overall volume, or increase average volume\u000a* increase sustain\u000a\u000aAlso, check out [Fluff's channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/fluff191) for tons of recording tips.

V100% not trying to come across as rude, make you feel bad or discourage you from playing at all. For a first song you should feel proud. \u000a\u000aDiversity is the key. The reason your band doesn't want to play this because it's just limiting them on what they can do. For example from a drummer preservative there's only so much he can do can do when someone is playing guitar like this. \u000a\u000aAlso the timing is just very odd and your cord progression just don't really go anywhere. I can't explain it in musical terms very well because I'm personally self taught &amp; just pretty much know everything from ear myself. It's just not very dynamic. \u000a\u000aI'd highly suggest just trying to slow down, get a metronome &amp; work on just getting the timing down and not just over using the same not. It's not a bad thing to use the same note a lot. You just have to have the other elements in the song to make it work. \u000a\u000aTake the song [ Skeleton Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOV56JKiL_A) by slayer. That song just rides the same not for EVER! Still it has elements that add to make it something that stand out and give it a twist that makes it sound unique. Don't take that to literal, just off the top of my head tossing out and example. \u000a\u000a\u000aFor you personally, I'd suggest getting guitar pro if you don't all ready have it. Get use to playing with metronome and work on your timing. I found a lot of Metallica, Judas Priest then working my way up to some Megadeath really helped improve my playing. Sometimes in order to progress you'll have to play things you might not really like, but you'll understand later on it's a build block. \u000a\u000a\u000aAlso Maiden. Like the Aces High Cord progession is amazing. You can hum it and hear right where the vocals would line up with that! That's what you need to be making, something that works well with the entire band. \u000a\u000aAlso, I always suggest Steve Vai\u000a\u000a[Ten hour work out!](http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/s/steve_vai/10-hour_guitar_workout_tab.htm  ) There's also guitar pro tabs for that on Ultimate guitar. Really cool just lower the tempo. This is good for people of any level. Starts out really simple and really picks up. \u000a\u000a\u000aStill like I said, be proud of yourself. Just understand that you still have to tighten up. Play with as many people as you can and just keep pushing more and more. Hope that was helpful. I know it was a massive wall of text but I kinda just wanted to try to be clear &amp; stay respectful and not just tell you blind thing with no reason behind them.

VThis series is great, thanks for keeping this going!  I just wanted to leave some positive feedback so you know your work is being read, since this sub is pretty small.  As a bass player who wants to graduate from playing covers to writing my own death metal, these quick overviews of important concepts are giving me all sorts of jumping-off points -- places to start experimenting and doing deeper research.\u000a\u000aOne thing I'm wondering about is whether I should work on my guitar chops if I want to write full songs.  I don't have a band (at least, the friends I practice covers with aren't at all interested in death metal) and it seems like a lot of bands write guitar parts first.  I've also got a keyboard I can use to write with, and I know it's possible to write guitar parts on a bass with a bit of imagination... I guess I'm just asking if you have any specific advice for bassists who want to write full songs.  I know that seems a bit off-topic, but well... I need some guitar parts if I'm going to practice writing contrapuntal bass lines!
p3467
aVHaving some skill on any instrument is hardly a bad thing, even if only to write songs. I don't have much of a way to work on guitar myself, but if I could I certainly would.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, writing a song based around a bass-line can be an interesting exercise in itself. For that I'd recommend getting a drum machine, so you can have a beat.
p3468
aVThat part in Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite Maiden moments. Guess this explains why I like it so much! I'll have to try and write some stuff utilizing this. Thanks for the write up!
p3469
aVMy pleasure. Good luck writing.
p3470
aVCool post. Nice to see some music theory here. I'd say that understanding harmony (for tonal music of course) is a prerequisite to writing meaningful contrapuntal line, especially for bass. Without a good understanding of harmony, writing contrapuntal line simply amounts to "write something different than what you do on guitar". Which isn't saying much.

aVThat is true. I guess I should have prefaced this with a discussion of harmony...too late now, I guess.

VTo be honest I'm not really a fan of the style, but man, that looks *stupid fun* to play.

Then when I heard you change over to the lower string I was surprised how natural it sounded. Thumbs up for creativity.

aVOn the site that I linked, the guy that posted that vocal track has another vocal track called Blackwater which is pretty good. Apart from that, it's pretty hard to find metal vocals tracks that are actually usable for this kind of thing.

aVNot bad. Very classic metal sound but not too simple to keep it interesting. I would redo the 1st solo cause it ends a bit out of tune. Unless that was the goal. I like the structure of the piece. I think it flows from part to part very well. Love that Major 7 chord at 3:50. It sounds like the song is over there but then you kick it back in with the main riff. Neat tune. 
p3497
aVThanks! I was using crappy old strings for this song that didn't stay in tune very well, I have since learned that new strings sound a lot better!

VReally nice.  The use of the interview footage is really cool but I feel like the track could use some original vocals/ less repetition of clips.

Also something about the way the drums are mixed makes it seem distant and inappropriately subtle. But really, I'm a fan and the whole thing is super creative and original.

aVThank you! Ye some of the repetition was a bit of a question mark for me. Could not deside what was too much. Alway good to find out lol. Drums were a problem.

Shit sounds huge.  I like each rig enough that I'm now in the market for an A/B/C/y pedal so I can play all 3 simultaneously live.

p3521
aVI'm in the process of building a doom rig, would love to hear how this came out.\u000a\u000aDid you re-amp through all these at once or did you send the signal 3 different times?\u000a\u000aAre you using any pedals to get to your tone? \u000a\u000aHow'd you get to the conclusion of running the 2x15 with the XXX?\u000a\u000aWith the Sunn being a bass amp did you run into any issues with that?\u000a\u000aMy current rig right now that I'm messing around with is:\u000aFender Bassman 100\u000aMarshall Cab w t75s\u000aKrank Krankenstein\u000aMesa recto w v30s\u000a\u000aI wonder if I added my 8x10 ampeg and my Peavy VB-2 to the mix but have no idea how I would split the signal a  third time (currently using a chorus pedal with stereo outs to do the split now)
p3522
aVI used an A/B/Y box to go to 2 amps at a given time.  Of the 3 guitar tracks recorded for each song, 2 were cut using the Sunn + the Laney, while the 3rd was cut using the Laney + the Peavey.  Pretty much the only pedal I used this session was a Superfuzz clone made by wattson.  That pedal sounds huge.  I also used a pigtronix class A boost for a lead at one point.  The sunn rig actually strips out much of the high end coming from my guitar and functions as almost a clean bass sound to offset the guitar sound from the laney.  The XXX through the 2x15, by contrast, has a dirty bass sound, so all three rounded things out nicely.  I got the idea to run the XXX through the 2x15 from having previously sent guitar heads through it with good results in the past.  I bought the cab off a friend in Primitive Man, and he had told me to give a guitar head a shot through it, so I did.  \u000a\u000aLook into getting an A/B/Y box to split your signal.  I'm considering getting the Voodoo labs pedal [in this link](http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B000CSPP5U/ref=smi_ge_rl_btns1_setch?_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;pldnNew=1) as it can run up to four heads simultaneously.  
p3523
aVThanks for the info. Was actually able to assemble mine a bit this weekend. ended up with two 4x12's and my 8x10 running at once. Massive. \u000a\u000a
p3524
aVI love that combination.  There's nothing like standing in front of a monolithic wall of cabs and feeling your shirt move from all the air you're pushing.  
p3525
aVHow the hell do you keep the thing quiet?\u000a\u000aI hooked up my setup with a Black Arts Toneworks Destroyer pedal and I get an unbearable hum/feedback and the Oath side of the pedal doesn't allow my Noise Gate to even close it's pushing so hard. \u000a\u000aAny ideas? Or do you just play thru it and turn off your drive pedals when your not playing? 
p3526
aVThe quality of your a/b/y setup has a lot to do with it.  When I first started experimenting with multiple amp setups I bought the cheapest a/b/y box I could find.  It worked, but there was significant amp buzz whenever I had both rigs running.  I then picked up a Radial Bigshot a/b/y which has an on board transformer as well as settings to help phase match amps, and that helped considerably.   Ground loops cause a ton of excess noise with these setups, but decent a/b/y boxes will eliminate them.  
p3527
aVI'll look into that for sure. \u000a\u000aTried running just the pedal straight in to just one amp - same issue. Thinking I've got some wicked back ground loop going on somewhere in the rig. Gonna demo it with my live rig for the other band and see if it does the same thing. 
p3528
aVI would bet that a lot of the noise is coming from splitting your signal from that chorus pedal.  A decent A/B/Y box is a worthy investment, and your rig will sound immense without a ton of superfluous racket going on.  
p3529
aVDo you use any kinda of noise gates, compression, ect?\u000a\u000aI want to use this rig live at some point ya know. Might need to check my cables from bad grounds.
p3530
aVChecking cables is always a good call.  At this point, no, I'm not running anything like that.  I've used noise supressor pedals on occasion in the past, but this hasn't been a huge issue for me with the current rig.  It'll feed back like a motherfucker if I have the fuzz on and am standing close to the heads, but that's something I'm also actively going for, and I use the feedback sounds live in conjunction with neck bends and other techniques like punching the body of the guitar to get cool noises from it.  
p3531
aVThanks for all the info - i'm a fuckin greenhorn when it comes too doom rigs. Been playing metal my whole life and it's nice. \u000a\u000a\u000aPost a recording of that studio stuff when you get a chance - would love to hear that shit. \u000a\u000a[Link to my band](http://www.speedgodband.com)

aVHaha, no worries.  I'm far from an expert.  I've learned most of what I know from experimentation &amp; trying to achieve the meatiest sound possible.

asVHow is my tone? Advise to improve? :)
p3539
(lp3540
VDjent isn't really my thing, but the tone does seem to fit pretty well for what you're doing.\u000a\u000aYou might wanna increase the lows, though. This is just me, but I feel like the tone is just a little bit too treble-y. It'd be pretty cool if you were to EQ it such that you have a bit more bass in there.
p3541
aVThanks dude, I'll try that :)
p3542
aVNP. Also, the first tone was better. Much cleaner.
p3543
aVI like them both. Depends on the style you're playing. First one deff more djent. Second one sounds like a good raw death metal tone.\u000a\u000aI dont get the hate for pod farm. They got good stuff. Sure there are better, but I just like pod farm's amps for some reason more than guitar rig or amplitube. \u000a\u000anice riffage tho
p3544
aVYeah no one seems to be digging the 2nd one very much, I like the twangy-ness of it, but still obviously needs improvement.
p3545
aVFirst is definitely much better. 2nd is much to 'hairy" sounding. What are you using for drums?\u000a
p3546
aVI also just want to say, the 2nd one loses all of it's power. Makes the whole thing sound weaker and much more like fake amp sims. That first tone in near perfect though. Very well done. 
p3547
aVSuperior 
p3548
aVI like the first one better, second I think has more potential though, but you need to give both tones some bottom end. It's really trebley. I'd also advice you to dial just a tad back on the distortion. Line 6's amp emulation has a habit of sounding very digital once you add too much distortion.\u000a\u000aAlso, a bit more compressor wouldn't hurt. :)
p3549
aVYeah it does sound very digital, I've dialed the distortion pretty far back already, but I could try more. The aim was to get more mid range to make the tone sound more full so it probably brought out the digital aspect a bit more. Thanks :)
p3550
aVThe 1st one sound really good (but maybe pretty "classic" too). But the drums and the mix need a lot of improvement: the snare and the kick don't fit.
p3551
asVBack with another tone test (Sorry, I know). Feedback is appreciated.
p3552
(lp3553
VMy two biggest critiques of your tone would be: \u000a\u000a\u000a1) Cut the lows and pump up the mids. Your tone is very heavy on the low end, which is okay when it is by itself. However, in a full mix, your tone would be burying the bass guitar while failing to cut through the mix as a whole (due to a lack of mids). \u000a\u000a\u000a2) Be careful when quad tracking. In the example you posted, the quad tracked guitars are quite a bit off between the right and left. Granted, I'm wearing headphones and you only made a tone test. To me, there is almost a 'perfect' echo or mimicry between the right and the left, so maybe it's an issue with latency or something instead (I hear the right note and the corresponding left guitar note is delayed almost in perfect halves). \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEven though that video recommends a Low-Pass Filter around 16k (interestingly, I think that is high for rhythm guitars; I'd say a better range is between 9k and 14k), I would have guessed that your sound had a very low Low-Pass Filter. Not sure what is going on there, but it could just be due to a lack of mids and highs dialed in. Look at the guitar track in ["Take This Life"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdtp-Y2DuPU) by In Flames, for example. I'm not a fan of the tone there but you can see how relatively high and thin it is by itself. 
p3554
asVAre my programmed drums too bland to continue with!?
p3555
(lp3556
VFor me, Animals As Leaders' debut album proves that if you put enough effort into them, programmed drums don't have to hold you back.
p3557
aVthose are awful\u000a\u000aput the snare on the 2 and 4, or on the 3\u000a\u000acymbals go steady on quarter notes\u000a\u000atake the toms out
p3558
aVMaybe should have mentioned this is sort of an "intro" into the song but either way I guess ill try that, also I'm a guitarist of 8 years but a drummer of none so it's difficult for me to understand how drumming works sometimes, though I understand the basics are keep the "structure"; a constant rhythm haha.
p3559
aVThe riff is pretty cool, but you aren't accenting the feel of it with the drum part. You want to make it groovy. A good place to start is a strong accent on the first beat of every measure, with a kick and a crash. \u000a\u000aFor that particular part I'd probably do two eighth notes on the kick to start so it would sound like bum bum badaba badaba bum bum badaba badaba. Putting a snare over the kick on the first beat of the second measure would give it a good balance, so it would be like\u000a\u000abum bum badaba badaba CRACK bum badaba badaba\u000a\u000aand the crash could just ride on the quarter notes\u000a\u000ahope that makes sense  \u000a\u000aremember that simple drums can do a lot to provide a good foundation for your guitar parts to shine through. offbeat stuff on the drums is more a drummer's thing
p3560
aVI think program drums sound fine but I didn't really like this track, what are you using?
p3561
aVIm using Hydrogen for the drums, the FLAC_GSCW-2 kit and 2 chinas and a splash from the "death metal" kit to be specific. The guitar is an AXL Mayhem series Clutch with alinco EMG passive pickups that came in the guitar with Reaper as my DAW, recording straight from my Peavey Vypyr 30 VIP-1 haha. edit: the only thing truly bothering me is the snare and toms (not heard in the sample!) because they sound like ass; to me at least!
p3562
aVdrums don't sound like theyre following anything. Drums are suppossed to act like a metronome. I understand if you want to have fills and what not, but those cant just be random. \u000a\u000aI suggest start off simple, like bass-snare-cymbal, and then work your way towards complex drum patterns.\u000a\u000aAlso, pretend that the programed drums is human. Would a human be able to play your drum track without being confused?
p3563
aVI played around with SD 2.0 for a while in pro tools but gave up shortly after and went back to Ableton Live. I found a myriad of categorized samples on a metal forum and using abletons drum rack, just mixed the samples, made rooms for them and ended up with a pretty decent sounding kit. Unfortunately, I haven't yet figured out how to layer the samples in one midi space, so changing the velocity of the hits only changes the relative DB level.
p3564
aVThey actually don't sound bad at all. I'd keep it.
p3565
aVI think you should send me your track without the drums and I'll see if I can play something to it if I get time. Might be fun...

asVHow to tell the difference between models of Schecter Hellraisers?
p3567
(lp3568
V&gt;I know the newer models come with 81TW and 89Rs. Older models come with 85s.\u000a\u000aThose are the coil split-able 81 and 85. Earlier models (mine, woot) have the standard 81 and 85, no coil split.\u000a\u000aFrom the EMG faq:\u000a\u000a&gt;you can tell the specific model by the color of the EMG logo on the face of the pickup. For example, if you have a humbucker sized pickup with a silver logo, it is an EMG-81; with a gold logo, it\u2019s an EMG-85.
p3569
aVBut see that doesn't appear to be the case. If you go to the EMG website and lookup the 85, it has the silver logo, whereas the 81 and 89 have the gold logo. Maybe it didn't used to be that way, but it is now.
p3570
aVMy info is from EMG's website, so you might drop them an e-mail asking for clarification.
p3571
aVIIRC the 89 is just an 85 that allows for split coil.\u000a\u000aMaybe you could ask the seller if it has a push pull knob which should tell you?\u000a\u000aFWIW I've got the 89 in my Jackson with push-pull coil split.  It's not that useful, with my gear I can hardly tell the difference between split or not.  If the coil split is the sole reason you prefer this model I'd suggest trying one out if you haven't yet.
p3572
aVMy main reason for wanting the 89s was that it ensures I'm getting the newest model of the C1.\u000a\u000aSo when I've found listings for the C1, I notice all these small differences, and it's hard for me to tell what model it is. There also seem to be the special and deluxe models which don't appear on the Schecter website, so I try to avoid those entirely.
p3573
aVWhat I would like to know is what the "diamond series" is all about. My C-1 Hellraiser is a diamond series, and the best I can reckon is that it's like a budget model because I came by it cheap. 
p3574
aVThe diamond series means it was made in South Korea. Otherwise, it could be made in China or Indonesia. I don't know really what the difference is though.
p3575
aVSchecter originally was a custom shop. When they started producing non-custom guitars, they labeled them "Diamond Series". Other than that, the SGR series is their super cheap end ones, and above Diamond series you've got USA Production and Masterworks.\u000a\u000aSo really, Diamond Series just means it's not their super low-end line or their super high-end line - it's everything in between, which is like 90% of their stuff. And there is Indonesian stuff in the Diamond Series - the Demon level stuff, for instance.
p3576
aVDiamond Series really just means production line (although their super budget line, confusingly called SGR, doesn't seem to be Diamond Series) as opposed to US custom shop production models, Matserworks or custom stuff.\u000a\u000aThe Hellraiser series is roughly in line with the ESP LTD 1000-level stuff. Here's kinda the hierarchy:\u000a\u000aSGR; Omen (followed by Omen Extreme which apparently are priced higher than Demons); Demon; Damien/Damien Elite, Stealth, and "Retro" which are similar quality more-or-less but different feature sets; Hellraiser, Custom (Hellraisers but fancy looking), Banshee, Blackjack, Hellraiser Hybrid, and the signature Artist models.\u000a\u000aThat's mostly based off price.
p3577
aVThanks for the clarification! It's a C-1 Hellraiser Diamond Series that I got second hand via ebay and... well, I haven't picked up my old budget epiphone since. It's a great guitar. The best part is that it sounds *incredible* for what it is - I use a Cool Cat Metal II distortion pedal and a behringer practice amp jacked into my pc and come out with a guitar sound that is way better than I would think I could get.   \u000a\u000aWorth every penny.
p3578
aVThey're solid guitars. I've got the LTD H-1001 which is similar and kicks ass, as well as a Hellraiser C7 which is awesome. My old guitarist plays a black Hellraiser C1, it shreds and sounds great!
p3579
aVOne of the first things I noticed was how *comfortable* it was. I'm a novice to indermediate player at best, so no shredding for me... but I can do chords and drills higher up the neck with very little effort or fatigue, which is awesome... and if I ever do get good enough to learn to shred, I am sure it will be a breeze.  \u000a\u000aWith my current setup I found a tone that I really love, using tons and tons of distortion but still sounds awesome, not muddy or chunky. Love it.

aVWell, metalcore has changed so much over the years that it can't really be categorized into such simple aspects anymore. It's gained some more musical qualities and progressive influences which hell I'm all for) but for the most part, music with breakdowns, really modern production, and "whiny" screaming is, essentially, metalcore. This song was okay imo. It's technical and cool for guitar nerds and stuff but I will have to agree with TechnoEquinox on a less dickheadish level, it's not entirely metal. It would be better with an angrier production and no triggers to me. That gating has *got* to go. But nonetheless you did a very good job, and you obviously worked a lot on it, so you get an A from me.
p3599
aVMost certainly is metalcore... but with man vocals.  Very cool track and sick guitar playing!
p3600
aVThis is Tech/Progressive Deathcore, just like my previous album ['Kaonashi'](http://theravenautarchy.bandcamp.com/album/kaonashi). And honestly, you need to stop using the rule "breakdown = metalcore" as reference because it is not reliable; use your ears instead.

p3619
asVHow do you make things sound louder without clipping?
p3620
(lp3621
VThe trick is to use a mastering limiter on the master track, lowering the threshold would make everything sound louder. If you go too crazy with it though, you get Death Magnetic.
p3622
aVA great way to use EQ is to split out the frequencies of double tracked guitars so they don't cut into each other. Boost the bass on one and the treble on the other. A multiband compressor will also let you selectively control different frequency ranges instead of just flattening the whole track.
p3623
aVBefore you apply a limiter to your master track, you'll probably want to make sure that you don't have a lot of extra frequencies taking space in the mix.
p3624
aVhow would I know that?
p3625
aVUsually what I do is take a band pass filter and move it up and down the frequencies of a track to pinpoint some undesirable frequencies and cut them a bit. Especially very high and very low ones(&lt;40Hz). They're not usually contributing much to your sound and just taking up space. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I bring everything in the mix to about -6db in the master track, apply any mastering effects and throw a limiter at the end of an effect rack to bring the volume up.\u000aLike the first comment said though, don't try to push too much through your limiter or it'll be forced to compress everything and it'll sound terrible...
p3626
aVmhmm... i know some of those words...

aVHonestly your cleans aren't too bad. It's not terrible or cringeworthy, but it could use some work. Why not just keep practicing and try to get it right? All you need is a little improvement, you're not too far off from getting it to sound good. The rest of the song kicked ass though!
p3640
aVThanks! This song is going to be on my bands live set once we start playing shows again, so I'm gonna be singing it live even if I use a guest singer on the studio version. The main problem for me practicing vocals is just the fact that I'm in high school and always have family in the house so I can't loudly practice without it getting awkward or them complaining. Someday when I live on my own or with room mates who work different schedules than me I'm gonna practice my singing like 24/7!
p3641
aVI know how you feel. I live with my parents still and it always seems weird when I sing. I'm in a condo and the walls are paper thin too so all my neighbors around me and people who pass by my window can hear lol. I'm afraid if I start doing metal vocals they'd think I was dying haha. 
p3642
aVI have no problem practicing metal vocals around people, since they know me as the metalhead guy that does death metal. What makes me uncomfortable is doing my crappy clean singing around them, since they also have the stereotype that metalheads are terrible singers and I don't want to be judged that way.

aVthanks!
p3647
aVWant an honest opinion man? The mixing is poorly put together. The vocals completely overpower everything else. I could barely hear the guitars, bass, and drums unless I really cranked up the volume. It reminds me a lot of Job For A Cowboy in their Genesis and Doom era (not a bad thing, but not sure if that was what you wanted to go for). You guys definitely have a lot of potential but seriously consider working on the mixing and production, especially in the vocal region. Boost up the volume on the music or lower the vocals and you guys may have something going. Hopefully you guys can make a sound for yourself and make something happen!
p3648

aVAlex Webster from Cannibal Corpse. I play bass in a grind/death metal band, so the guy is one of my idols. Met after the first show they ever played in my hometown on the Kill tour. Super chill dude. His demeanor with fans is legendary and I can see why. After I got the fanboy bullshit out of the way, I asked him some techniques on 3 finger plucking, and he showed me on his water bottle how to count the timing. Since then, I took that advice to heart and read some of his books while my band was recording. I've definitely become a better bassist and can keep up note for note plucking with my guitarist at 250 bpm plus with that single bit of advice he gave me. 
p3701
aVThe dude is insanely knowledgeable. I watched the making of Torture on YouTube a while back and the someone asked him the scale that some part is in and he just friggin takes off. Totally makes sense why he'd be in a band with Ron Jarzombek. I didn't realize it until I read an interview with Ron that Alex actually wrote quite a few of the parts on the Blotted Science album and ep.\u000a\u000aThe technique you're talking about, is it the accents on 1 thing? When you accent on each finger (i.e. 3* 2 1 3 2* 1 3 2 1*) I saw him mention that on an interview and started working on that. It's tough to get the hang of, but I know it'll make my plucks a lot more consistent when I finally do get it.
p3702
aVHe went to music school somewhere, so yeah, he knows his shit. That's the exact technique. I took away from it to quit thinking with 3 fingers and start focusing on strumming on the beat with whatever finger is handy(heh.) He also commented on wrist position, which helped me to create an even tone across all 3 fingers as, at least for me, my ring finger is not as flexible at the second joint and is shorter so it sounds different than my index and middle. From his books I learned a lot about string skipping that helped tremendously. I've incorporated his techniques into my own practice style and I'm much more confident. I'm throwing in triplet sixteenths in a riff that I couldn't do a year ago.

What was supposed to be a two song set turned into an 8 song show just because he wanted to. Talked with him for a bit after and then he signed my copy of Deconstruction.\u000a\u000aLater on at the show, I was on barrier and he remembered me. Looked at me, and made faces at me the entire show. Then after the set he came off the stage, straight to me, shook my hand, remembered my name and thanked me for coming and supporting him. He then went from one side of the barrier to the next thanking everyone, and then in the end came back to me and shook my hand again. Will NEVER forget that day! One of the most humble, down to earth people I've ever meet.\u000a\u000aTL;DR Met Devin before the show. After his set, he comes down, shakes my hand, and thanks me by name. Such a fantastic person.

aVSimilar story. He hung out with the crowd after a show in New Zealand. Shot the shit about anything and everything. Such a humble, compassionate guy. My most prized possession is the Ziltoid shirt that he signed after on that night.\u000a\u000aMy favourite memory from the whole encounter, however, is of a man of Indian descent who happened to be wearing a shirt that read approximately: "God is too big for one religion." Devin noticed it and remarked that he liked the shirt. The young fellow then insisted that Devin take the shirt and they ended up swapping shirts. \u000a\u000aI think about that shirt sometimes and wonder if it ended up in Canada, perhaps displayed with other memories from the road. In all likelihood it probably got thrown out, but a man can dream can't he? A man can dream.\u000a\u000aTL;DR Devin Townsend swaps shirts with a fan after a show in New Zealand.
p3707
aVI once got to talk really, really quickly to Matt Pike after a Sleep set. He's a *really* nice and cool guy, and a little spacey, and of course he was really sweaty, too. Pretty much just what you'd expect from him.
p3708
aVI dig the Primus reference in your username. 
p3709
aVI dig that you caught my Primus reference!
p3710
aVI met Alan Averill from Primordial when he was in town recording with Blood Revolt. My friend is friends with Chris Ross (Axis Of Advance) who is also in Blood Revolt.\u000a\u000aMy friend called me up and asked if I wanted to tip pints with Alan from Primordial. I said hells yeah!\u000a\u000aAlan is a very interesting and honest guy. Very serious about his music and the direction of Primordial. \u000a\u000aPretty much the only metal musicians I know are local guys who have day jobs and such. It was interesting talking to someone in a real "working" band.
p3711
aVNot exactly the impression I got when I met him in a urinal. He conforms to the rest of the Dublin metal scene, musicians and fans alike, which can briefly be described as not caring about music so much as street cred. How many albums and singles you own and how rare they are. Discounting anyone who's a fan of metal that isn't the obcurest of obscure, underground-est of underground as "knuckledraggers." In a word, hipsters. Completely hypocritical, of course: when asked his opinion on Opeth, said they're "not that important or influential." His most popular song, The Coffin Ships, is a blatant love letter to Opeth (accompanied by wildly out of tune singing). I could get more in depth about his lyrical content being rooted strongly in Irish nationalism/ Irish grudge against England zeitgeist. Dude is half English. Maybe he is very serious about his music, but he's not objectively aware of it. Very "rockstar" personality, which is understandable considering that Primordial is the  Irish metal band anyone is most likely to have even heard of. 
p3712
aVYou got all that from taking a piss beside him? :)\u000a\u000aI know nothing about the Dublin metal scene .. this happened in Calgary, Canada.
p3713
aVAlan: you're a tall fucker  \u000ame: you're alan  \u000a*zip*  \u000a*zip*  \u000awe continued chatting in the pub after we finished our business. He DJ's regularly at Bruxelle's Harry Street in Dublin.
p3714
aVI met the guys from The Ocean after their show in Brisbane, Australia a few years ago. I saw the drummer and tried to buy him a drink but he said "come drink with us man!" \u000a\u000aThey were awesome. So friendly, and they bought me and my cousin drinks all night. I had a huge conversation with Jona Nido. He gave me his email after. Amazing band and really great people. 
p3715
aVI met Jeff Loomis from Nevermore once outside on the parking lot of the *LKA* in Stuttgart . Super nice down to earth guy. \u000aNevermore didn't play that night because Warrel Dane didn't make it in time. Jeff and the other guitar guy (Attila Vörös, who was also quite nice btw) were really sad that they would have to cancel and then invited me and a friend to see them a few days later in Munich.\u000aWe talked a little more, had a beer, and then i went back inside, because the next band was on. Really friendly guys.\u000a
p3716
aVI actually assist in setting up shows in Denver so I've met quite a few. Some people stand out:\u000a\u000a* Russell Allen (Symphony X) - Really cool dude. He wasn't feeling well so we just got hammered before he went on stage. He was hitting on my friend the whole time, which bugged me because he's married.\u000a\u000a* Nevermore - Warrel is kind of a dick, or just really egotistical. Jeff was fun to chat with. This was big for me because I'm a huge fan.\u000a\u000a* James (Arsis) - Weird situation for me. He was high off his ass and I don't smoke so it was just awkward for me while we were in the bus. Also note that I'm not a fan of Arsis.\u000a\u000a* Fear Factory - Went to a bar across the street with the guys. Dino is fucking hilarious; I was crying laughing so hard. Burton was more reserved, but a pretty chill dude.\u000a\u000a* Vitek (Decapitated) - Cool guy, but he stands out because of his death. When I found out I was really very sad since he was my age. \u000a\u000aI've met just about every major band that's traveled through Denver except the really big ones like Metallica and Megadeth. Feel free to ask questions about any of them. 
p3717
aVDo you subscribe to /r/TouringMusicians? Your knowledge of the Denver scene could be helpful!
p3718
aVI do not. I'll check it out, thanks. 
p3719
aVAwesome! I used to go to a lot of shows in Denver, usually at the Ogden or Gothic Theater. Who had the most unexpected personality once you met them out of all the bands you've encountered?
p3720
aVSame here. I love how small the Ogden is. The Fillmore is fun too.  I've only been to the Gothic a couple times.
p3721
aVNice! The Gothic might actually be my favorite out of the Denver venues. I bet I would have loved the Ogden's 21+ area if I hadn't been underage at the time. Now I'll have to go check it out again whenever I'm back in Colorado.
p3722
aVMan I love the Gothic. I've grown fond of Marquis and Summit Hall too. Summit reminds me of the Fillmore before they banned metal. \u000a\u000aMost surprising? The dudes from Watain. I thought they were all shoe. I was wrong. 
p3723
aVMet Dream Theater?
p3724
aVI met John briefly. He was pretty quiet.
p3725
aVGoing to guess Myung.
p3726
aVMy friend and I smoked up Dave from Intronaut a while back when they were opening for Animals as Leaders. Super down to earth, and a really cool guy. 
p3727
aVMet Periphery when they opened for Darkest Hour(so not all the same guys are there) talked to their bass player at the time and played Soul Calibur with them at the merch booth, been a fan ever since
p3728
aVI've met quite a few but by far my favorite was hanging out with Joel Stroetzel of Killswitch Engage the handful of times I did. He used to come to my old bands rehearsals sometimes, and occasionally we'd end up back at his parents house, and one time he even let me play his Caparisons and PRS. He's really a humble, friendly, selfless guy. \u000a\u000aOne time I saw Porcupine Tree with him and some friends, and I went out to smoke a butt with him and when we came back inside, we ended up in a group of me, him, Brian Fair, Phil Labonte and some of the others guys from Shadows Fall/ATR. I was kind of in awe and kept my mouth shut, but they were very cool, friendly people. It's rare to not see Brian at local shows around Boston.\u000a\u000aBesides him, my other favorite interaction was seeing Opeth in MA back in 2005 or so with the original lineup. It was like -10F outside and there were a bunch of us waiting by the bus. Mikael came out in a huge fur coat, signed autographs, was very friendly, but ran right back inside exclaiming that "it's colder than Sweden out here!", however, Peter Lindgren stayed and just shot the shit until everyone left. Single-handedly the most handsome man I've ever met, I've had a bit of a man-crush on him since then.
p3729
aVI met Nuke, the guitar player from Motograter, he came over for a jam session and smoke out with my old band. Cool dude, down to earth - in fact, so down to earth and a pleasure to hang with, that I felt ridiculous for even being a little nervous. 
p3730
aVMy most recent encounter was with Bill Steer and Jeff Walker from Carcass after a show in Miami a few weeks ago. \u000a\u000aThey were both super cool and very gracious to me and my buddy. They were about to go on the 70,000 Tons of Metal cruise and were kinda nervous about it. Really nice guys. 
p3731
aVI'd be nervous about being trapped on a boat with a bunch of sweaty metal dudes too. \u000a\u000aAlso, gotta reschedule again. Beers next week fro' shizzle, maybe during the week.
p3732
aVNext week sounds good to me. During the week might be problem though, I do Crossfit and Jiu-Jitsu all week. PM me your phone# if you want. 
p3733
aVI met Chris Adler (Lamb of God Drummer) after one of thier shows. Actually a super cool guy. He seemed genuinely complemented that we liked his band and that we would come see thier show. He was just really chilled out and nice. \u000a\u000aI met the guys from Protest the Hero one year at Warped Tour, they were also awesome, I was mainly shooting the shit with Luke about guitar stuff, they signed my t-shirt that I bought and we went on our way.\u000a\u000aLet's see, who else... Met the dudes in the Chariot twice at two different shows, Josh Scogin (singer) was a little stand offish, but the other dudes were all cool. Oh yea, met the singer from God Forbid, he seemed pretty annoyed about something, so I didn't really have much of a conversation with him.
p3734

aVNot in the biz.  I just went to shows all the time.  If I think of any more Ill post em.  Cheers
p3737
aVOne of the last times I saw the Black Dahlia Murder, Trevor Strnad and Brian Eschbach were literally just standing next to the stage after the show so they could hi five and say thanks to everybody who came. I got a sweaty, shirtless hug from Trevor and it was the greatest day of my life
p3738
aVI met the drummer of Iced Earth a few years ago. Really nice guy. We talked about drumming for around 20 minutes.
p3739
aVMet the dudes from Wintersun last summer when they did the meet n greet before each show and got to listen to their soundcheck.\u000a\u000aSuper fun guys, was a little akward, but fun. Their soundcheck was awesome as well; got to hear all the samples going. Lots of fun.
p3740
aVGary Holt and Rob Dukes of Exodus.  Incredibly nice dudes - both made a point to come introduce themselves and say hi when my band opened for them back in 2010.\u000a\u000aThe day before one of our Texas stops on tour last year, we ended up at the Exodus / Anthrax show in Dallas.  My singer and guitarist ran into Gary outside the venue - he recognized them and invited them onto their bus, handed them each a cup of vodka, and proceeded to get them absolutely plastered.
p3741
aV[deleted]
p3742
aVI am a close friend of Shannon Lucas of All That Remains/ Black Dahlia/ and now Battlecross. He is genuinely one of the greatest people you could ever hope to know. He graciously speaks to any fan brave enough to approach him and is all ways truly greatful to hear the praise of those folks. He is brutally honest and will always be so. I can honestly say he is one of the closest friends I have and will ever have. So if you see him don't be shy go ahead and say hello.  
p3743
aVI've met Daniel Myhr and Joachim Broden of Sabaton a few times backstage at Sonisphere and their 2010 cruise through a mutual friend and they're genuinely nice guys and a really good laugh.   \u000a  \u000aI also met Sam and Herman from Dragonforce a fair few times at various London bars or before/after shows and while Sam is a top bloke, Herman is a bit of an arrogant dick and even in the early days seemed to have a very high opinion of himself.  \u000a  \u000aOther than that, I met Power Quest many times and ended up out all night in London with them following an album launch party in about 2006, Intense, Sonata Arctica who again are all top guys and always happy to meet and chat with fans etc.  \u000a  \u000aThe only other guy I can think of is Gavin Harper, the former guitarist of Alestorm. Met him back when they were Battleheart and he was running around bloodstock blind drunk and draped in a Scottish flag.
p3744
aVNicko McBrain lives in the Fort Laurderdale, FL area and owns a restaurant called Rock N Roll Ribs near there. Throughout the year he will basically throw parties in the parking lot and jam out on Iron Maiden tunes and other stuff. Funny as hell and very friendly. I was down there in December for the anniversary party. Everyone is welcome, just show up and have a good time.
p3745
aVI hung out with Disperse for a few days in their tiny little hometown outside Krakow, Poland. Drank, smoked, jammed, went to the club, watched them practice. All of them are a bunch of great guys.
p3746
aVme and my buddy hung out with all the guys of cattle decapitation... well josh was off checking out something for the majority of the night. brought a dub sac and my personal bong to the show to smoke out the band. my buddy had told me he knew travis ryan really well. travis had no idea who the fuck he was so i just start saying i need to smoke with him to save the situation and whip out my fat gourd sized bong and start packing it. after travis took us over to the van, rah (the bassist that was touring with them before monolith) comes out with some beer and procedes to drink and smoke with us and all four of us just started talking about ghost stories and shit. great dudes, and apparently we got dave so stoned he actually was playing everything slightly slower which seemed to throw josh and rah off for the first song. 
p3747
aVI've been incredibly lucky in my time.\u000a\u000aAlex Skolnick: Met him outside his tour bus after a show. He was super nice, and incredibly patient with another fella who had him sign a laughable amount of shit. We just talked gear, metal, and jazz.\u000a\u000aOpeth: Met the band after walking out of dream theaters set while they were touring together. They were all very nice. Mikael had a cold and was coughing all over the place. I caught that cold.\u000a\u000aGus G: met him after the Jason Becker Not Dead Yet show, which he played last year. He was super nice, and just standing around talking about how unreal an experience playing for jason was. \u000a\u000aThat is mostly what comes immediately to mind, although I'm sure there are more. 
p3748
aVI have met Jim Sadist from Nunslaughter on two separate occasions. I am a Clevelander and they are a heavyweight death metal band, one of the first death metal bands in the country.  Jim is extremely down to earth and one of the coolest people I have met in my entire life.  He has the sickest metal vest I've ever seen and has a great sense of humor.  I met him the first time while walking down the street, he drives by in a Staples truck and jumps out to give me a Nunslaughter sticker which I still have on my guitar this day and a Hell's Headbangers compilation CD.  This was around 3.5 years ago.  A couple weeks ago at a Morbid Saint show at a local venue I met him the second time and he actually remembered meeting me the first time and I got to chat with him for a little bit.
p3749
aVI met Richie and Igor Cavalera when they were touring with Soulfly back in August. Didn't really get anything more than a picture with Igor, but Richie was a really nice, down-to-earth kind of guy and thanked me for buying Incite's album from him. \u000a\u000aI also met all of the guys in Enslaved at Amon Amarth last month. Really nice guys, didn't really get to chat since they were signing stuff, but they were nice guys.
p3750
aVI've met Dave Mustain, and Marty Friedman..and the whole band really back on the Youthanasia tour.  Dave was cool, he did a radio liner for us and Marty was nice, but REALLY spacey. and He's A LOT shorter than I thought, kind of a fidget, and I'm not a tall guy.   I've also met Brian Beller, the bassist for the live Deathklock,  he was super nice and approached us after his bass clinic.  I have also met Biohazzard back in 1996 as well.  Billy and bobby were the guitarists and they were really nice and signed my jeans jacket...yeah I said jeans jacket.  \u000a
p3751
aVMy favorite musicians I've met are the guys from Byzantine.  I've had to opportunity to sit around and bullshit with them all at several shows. They always mingle in the crowd and watch the other bands. Super nice guys all around.

VThose vocals are just...bad. If that's you, you need to use your diaphram and get your volume up a lot- you're not projecting like, at all and it sounds like you're whispering badly into the mic.

asVEQ tips for an 8 string with EMG pickups?
p3784
(lp3785
V808's are notoriously hard to get a good sound out of. If you can, replace them with X-series EMGs or Blackouts.\u000a\u000aI would recommend adding a EQ to your recorded tones, and messing with it to see what frequencies sound good which dont. you can do this by setting a EQ with a high Q / negative gain, and move it around the freq range till your tone sounds better. chances are there are "dead spots" in your tone.\u000a\u000aAlso, what guage/type of string are you using for the lowest note? too light of a string is a common problem.\u000a\u000aThis thread is a pretty good info dump: http://www.sevenstring.org/forum/gear-equipment/259160-general-8-string-eq-tips.html
p3786
aVI have a similar setup. Custom 8 string built by a luthier friend with 808s. Pod x3. I get decent tones out of my x3. I have a friend that used to use farm and he recently got a pod hd, and he says the hd sounds way better. Maybe that's your problem. And just as a general rule, you need way less gain than you think.
p3787
aVI don't own an 8 string but I suspect that it is a combination of really low notes and not thick enough strings, perhaps?\u000a\u000aI think the thickest open string (whatever it is) on an 8-string sounds like poop with 90% of players.
p3788
aVLess gain, less bass, more mids. Less strings even :)

p3796
aVSweet. What's your style/genre? 
p3797
aVThat's a cool idea. Message me in a few days if you don't hear back from me, I want to do this but not sure when I will be able to.
p3798
aVTake your time man; there is no rush. I may actually throw up some drum tracks and see if anyone can write to it. 
p3799
aVThat's awesome too. I am a novice, so this sort of collaboration would be very useful for me. I will most likely just record some improvised riffs along with a few that I have written down. It will help figure out where I want to go with these tunes.
p3800
aVOkay, per your request, here are three rough "songs" I have been working on. I have two versions of each: One is a quick and dirty live rundown of the riffs, the other is a more put-together guitar pro where I have the pre-rendered guitars instead of live. It's how I "compose" I guess. You'll notice there is no live guitar version of #3... this is because number 3 is one that I wrote but can't actually play because I... need practice. They are all in wav format so you can play with/arrange them as need be to make them work for your purposes. \u000a\u000aHave fun:  \u000a[Number one \u005c(live\u005c)](https://www.mediafire.com/?br2lov5wiwmdeji)  \u000a[Number one \u005c(guitar pro'd\u005c)](https://www.mediafire.com/?94iap2aw3odkp3u)  \u000a[Number two \u005c(live\u005c)](https://www.mediafire.com/?gawby7ws5tx2q71) \u000a[Number two \u005c(guitar pro'd\u005c)](https://www.mediafire.com/?gawby7ws5tx2q71u)  \u000a[Number three \u005c(guitar pro'd\u005c)](https://www.mediafire.com/?gawby7ws5tx2q71)

aVJust a heads up: I haven't forgotten this, I've just been busy. Sorry I'm slow haha!
p3803
aVOh yeah, no worries. I only gave you kind of bits and pieces to work with anyway. A couple of those I hadn't worked on in ages, and after listening to them again I want to change them entirely!  \u000a\u000aA big problem I have is that I tend to come up with like an intro and maybe a verse or bridge, then I just get stuck.    \u000a\u000aFor the ones in guitar pro I have my own really shitty drum parts that I put together, but nothing like what an actual drummer can do.   \u000a\u000aSo in any case take your time and heave fun with it. Maybe we will be able to help each other out.   \u000a\u000aI'm also working on a couple of punk rock type songs, mainly influenced by The Misfits but right now they need *a lot* of work.
p3804
aVI'm the same way with writing guitar parts. I can play a little, but I struggle with finishing a song. That's why I come on here to work with folks who can haha. \u000a\u000aI'm into punk as well. I love a good punk influenced metal band. 
p3805
aVAwesome! When I get a little farther into.those tunes I will link them for you. 
p3806
aVSweet. You have guitar pro? I will send you a few things when I get home!
p3807
aVI use Reaper. 
p3808
aVnot used that one before, any good? 
p3809
aVI like it. I don't know a whole lot about it really. Just enough to track drums from an electronic kit. I'm using ezdrummer, so it sounds pretty decent. 
p3810
aVThat's cool was gonna look up some tutorials on it anyways, can you get good sounds out of it?
p3811
aVhttps://m.soundcloud.com/christophersmith-15/untitled here's a track with drums I recorded. Another redditor did the guitars. It's obviously still unfinished and the drums can be mixed better, but you get the idea. 
p3812
aVHaha holy shit you're way out of my league. My stuff will suck now.
p3813
aVNah, give it a shot. We'll make something cool together. :) 
p3814
aVWhat kind if edrums do you use? Do you have any issues with latency?
p3815
aVI have Roland TD 11 and there isn't much of a latency issue. There is a slider that allows you to reduce the latency in Reaper. I have a crappy laptop that I'm using, so there is a slight delay, but it's only noticeable when I play really fast.  
p3816
aVAre you having latency problems? One thing that I didn't understand from the start is that I should plug my headphones into my TD-11 module(not the computer) and use the AISO driver that it comes with in Reaper. I started out running my headphones from my computer, so the AISO driver wasn't playing anything back and I couldn't understand why. All of the other drivers that I tried had big latency issues. I figured it out on accident.
p3817
aVReaper's a DAW for recording. There's a 60 day trial period but it doesn't expire so it's shareware, but the license is only $60 for personal use which is pretty decent given that it's a pretty powerful.\u000a\u000aI do find that combining Audacity with Guitar Pro is a great way for sampling drums.
p3818
aVThis is a thrash piece me and a friend did a while back. If you can add drums to it, that'd be pretty cool.\u000a\u000aSorry for the terrible audio quality, though. At the time, we were only using Garageband and USB guitar cables to record stuff. We'll probably rerecord this at some point once I get my new interface.\u000a\u000ahttp://m.soundcloud.com/haaris-sohail/thrash-metal-symphony

aVAwesome, I like it. Do you have a click track you can put with it? That will make things a lot quicker for me.

aVI used to hate click tracks until I was forced to use one to record. Now I pretty much have to have one haha. It makes things a lot easier. If you can put one to it, that'd be cool. I can also try to map it out. 
p3822
aVhow do I record click tracks with my reaper file?
p3823
aVFirst, enable the metronome button(it's in the group of buttons just under the file menu at the top left -- right click the button to edit how it functions). Then you set the tempo/bpm with the 'tap tempo' button. You can either tap the button repeatedly with the speed you want, or you can just type it in. If the song has tempo changes, you can add a tempo change marker by right clicking on the timeline up top, and clicking 'insert tempo marker'. \u000a\u000aIf my explanation is confusing, just check out the user guide in the help section, or just google it. \u000a\u000aIf you're planning on re-tracking the guitars anyway, then just do a simple scratch track for me to play drums to, then do a proper tracking once I have drums for ya. 
p3824
aVI jammed a bit on that tune and I have some cool ideas for it. I tried making a click for it, but the guitars speed up and slow down here and there, and I'm not good enough with reaper to work it out. If you can re-record the guitars with a click, then I can track the drums. Don't spend too much time on it, just get a basic scratch track and then you can re-track the guitars over the drums. 
p3825
aVI'll probably download the MP3 of the track and make a click track to it in Garageband. Should be ready in 2-3 days, since I'm busy with homework right now.

p3830
asVAnother new song I've been working on, death metal, kinda tech-y, definitely fast, still melodic... What do you think?
p3831
(lp3832
VIt's awesome. I'd offer the same criticism I give my own music. Try varying the riffs around instead of repeating them back to back, also maybe try some changes in between the riffs that are less than 4 bars. \u000a\u000aEDIT:\u000aMore suggestions, take 'em or leave 'em. Cut the intro riff repetitions in half. Riff B repeats are good, maybe consider small variations in the rhythm but the length is great. Riff C seems to repeat a lot, I'd like to hear the chug bits extened in that riff every now and then. Riff D is good. I'd say vary the beat int he second half. I think after that the song should continue forward and not repeat Riff C. The little blast bit at the end of riff D was pretty cool soundsing and might be a good lead into Riff E.
p3833
aVThanks! Yeah, arrangement is not my strong suit; it's really tough for me figuring out where to put things and if the repeats sound good or not. Normally I'll come up with all the riffs at once while recording and just try and get as much length out of them as I can. I can also get a little lazy in programming the drums ;)\u000a\u000aBut seriously, thanks for the criticisms! I'll take your advice and go back through and try to get more variation on the track. I'm doing everything all myself, so it's good to get another set of critical ears listening to a track every once in awhile!

p3844
aVYeah I had another drum part over the chorus that had a sort of half-time feel to it, but I couldn't find a place for it in the current arrangement. I'm sure I'll be able to figure something out. Again, thanks for listening and I'm glad you dig it!

p3847

Vbut on the description of the song you say not to criticize it :|
p3849
aVI was just joking when I wrote the description, I really want to get better at mixing/mastering which is why I posted it here. Also, any and all comments on the musicality are very welcome. 
p3850
aVI dunno man, I like black metal, especially raw stuff.  the only think that kinda bugged me was the vocals felt like they sat more on my left.  I'll give it another listen but if you were going for raw you got it haha.
p3851
aVIt's nice and atmospheric- feels like it could fit well into a movie or game cinematic. It flows well and, without the "Hail Satans" would be something I'd want to download and throw into a mellow playlist for studying or reading to. Hell, even with them, it's fine up until near the end where they get more obvious and legible. \u000a\u000aIt's somewhat generic, as you said, but I feel like it's well done enough to not really matter. \u000a\u000a
p3852
aVThe drums sound way too "plush", and they are too uniform. I don't mean just the volume - everything about the attack screams of MIDI.  The snare attack should be far more aggressive, and the bass drum sounds like someone patting their leg with their hand. Try samples of real metal drummers instead. It is sparse enough you could do magic with it.\u000a\u000aThe rest of it sounds pretty cool, like it could have been lifted from a movie soundtrack.
p3853
aVYea, I'm using the default garageband drum samples, so no matter what the drums aren't gonna have that same raw quality as the rest of the song. Do you know if there's anywhere where I could get some better samples for free? 
p3854
aVThere are many sample based instruments for Garage Band. I just googled "garage band drum kits" and found way more than I knew existed.
p3855
aVDrum intro seems a little too long, it sounds kinda empty. Maybe some ambient sound could help. The drum timing isn't "sloppy" enough, I think you could use the "humanize" function. The atmosphere is quite cool, but the reverb sounds a little too...metallic. Try convolution reverb, there's a free one that comes with Reaper. Panning the vocal left is kinda odd, but I think it works, in fact it's quite cool. The riff is good too.

asVBeginner guitarist here, asking for some scale and chord knowledge from fellow metal heads.
p3875
(lp3876
VCheck out scalerator.com. I believe that's the name, but it allows you to create any chord/scale in any key and string tuning and print them out. It's a neat little resource for discovering new sounds and such
p3877
aVPhrygian dominant, harmonic minor. Probably the biggest scales in metal. 
p3878
aVOriental scale is really good,Nile uses it alot and so does Behemoth at times.
p3879
aVNile mostly seems to use Phrygian dominant (the fifth mode of harmonic minor), from experience.  The Oriental scale is a slightly different beastie, or at least the one I'm thinking of is.
p3880
aVLearn how to use the minor pentatonic in any key with root notes on 6th string and 5th string. Then learn the major pentatonic to join on to the minor pentatonic. For example if you are playing in G minor you would use the minor pentatonic in G. You could also use the major pentatonic in A# to join on to the minor in G. This is because A# is the relative major to G minor.  Hope this makes sense :)
p3881
aV[deleted]
p3882
aVMost guitarist start off learning pentatonic/blues scale, as it is relativly easy (5 main notes), solos well off most simple chord progressions, and is the basis for most classic rock/early metal songs. It also allows players to easily start jamming and improvising to songs.\u000a\u000aI, however think that if you're going to start off right, you should start learning ALL the diatonic scales/modes, as this will be a strong basis for being more musically versatile down the road. I'd start with the Ionian and Aeolian modes (major and minor scale respectively), and work from there. Learn the shapes/patterns everywhere on the neck, how they relate in terms of step structure, and how they sound tonally (major, minor, diminished).\u000a\u000aAfter you've got a firm understanding of the basics (don't half-ass and cut corners), then you can start looking more into metal oriented scales. Typically, you'll see alot of natural and harmonic minor scales used, as well as what some call the middle-eastern scale, as they are typically given a negative connotation. 
p3883
aVMetal guitar means a lot of different things across different genres. All in all, while there's some solid advice here, I would recommend you start out by learning as many songs you like as possible.\u000a \u000aMetal, at least what that means to me, is generally less *jam* based than a lot of other guitar-heavy genres. Songs *usually* aren't written through a process of coming up with a chord progression and scale and fiddling around until you have something.\u000a \u000aCommon chord progressions and common scales show up more because of common taste than because the songwriters sat down and picked the sames scales and progressions.

Vholy scooped guitars batman! Overall the mix sounds pretty good, my only compaint is that when only the the guitar bass and drums are playing the sound is a little hollow, which I think is due to most of the mids being scooped on the guitars. Even when the keyboards and other instruments are playing I feel like there is still somewhat of a hole in the mix created by the guitars. Other than that its pretty good.
p3889
aVThanks for the comment! I appreciate your advice, I will definitely see what I can do with the mids.  There is just so much going on in some tracks, EQing can be pretty tedious haha. 
p3890
aVYea, especially with all those folk instruments that come in at various points. If you haven't already I would look up a mixing guide that show what order to mix the instruments in, I think it normally starts with the bass drum and snare, then bass guitar, then moves on from there. You're obviously competant at mixing (otherwise this busy mix would be a total mess) but having a guide to bring you through the tedious process might be very helpful.

p3898
(lp3899
VI did a video on the 2 note riff in black metal. Some examples, a little breakdown on how it's used in songwriting, and why every black metal song is * E.
p3900
aVSo your guitar is tuned to Open A-Tuning (E, A, E A C# E)?
p3901
aVBad choice of words on my part. I mean open strings, why every song is in E. But Open Tuning would certainly work and I think it could produce some great results
p3902
aV(Pardon my beginner questions)\u000a\u000aIn the video you're just in standard tuning?
p3903
aVYep E Standard. Most black metal I know of is, I should have taken the time to make that clear
p3904
aVNo worries. It's all clear now.
p3905
aVPlease make more videos about the theory behind black metal techniques. I thoroughly enjoyed this 
p3906
aVI wish I knew more about drumming because that's my favorite side of black metal musicianship,  there's so many different things a drummer can play under the same riff and make it sound completely different. I might try doing something like that using samples. Another idea I had in mind was lyrics. Both will take some time to prepare but fortunately I get bored easily and that's when I make em
p3907
aVCool. Look forward to more!!
p3908
aVGood lesson for beginners!\u000a\u000aWhen in doubt, consult Darkthrone.
p3909
aVI originally had a bit pointing out how Mayhem and Burzum didn't really use two note riffs, not to the extent of Dark throne at least. But I couldn't play the damn riffs (Freezing Moon and Ea) so I cut it out. It took me about 7 tries to play that Angantyr riff too. Dark throne's so simple yet so good
p3910
aVCome to think of it I can't think of a Mayhem song that makes use of it extensively. Bursum uses more full chords but I do recall when he did his demonstration video, at least one of the songs was made up of a running low E with a higher note on the 5th string being played.\u000a\u000aThe quintessential example though would have to be Darkthrone's Transilvanian Hunger, and there probably were some songs on panzerfaust that did the same too. Not familiar enough with Gorgoroth or Immortal to point out any songs but I'm sure they did it too.
p3911
aVHoly shit! This is **exactly** what I've been looking for.\u000a\u000aI'm very much a beginner guitar player and also a huge black metal fan. I've found it fairly difficult to find any information on how to play black metal.\u000a\u000aYour video really opened my eyes! I just wish my guitar was near by. \u000a\u000aAnother challenge I face as a beginner is getting the black metal tone. Could you do a video on black metal tone? Maybe cross a few of the sub-genres? (raw, symphonic, Norwegian, etc.)
p3912
aVAh, tone actually plays a huge part in the 2 note riff, that was something I wanted include. I knew I was missing something. \u000a\u000aHigh treble opens up difference between the bass note and harmony, a heavy bass tone would make everything sound fat which is great for chugging but not tremolo picking. Another way black metal separates itself from Death metal.\u000a\u000aOne thing I do differently though is I don't scoop mids, which is part of getting that thin, Darkthrone sound.\u000a\u000aI'm not a huge gearhead so I don't know everything about getting the right sound but it's definitely something I'll try, thanks for the suggestion
p3913
aVThanks for the response!\u000a\u000aI look forward to more videos from you.
p3914
aVWhat is the signal/effect chain you're using in the video? It sounds surprisingly good for a single isolated guitar. 
p3915
aVI actually have no gear at all, the effects are all run through a Vox Valvetronix AD100VT-XL which has preset effects, I tweaked my sound to the one I like the most. No idea how it's setup, but on my side, I have the gain. At 75%, treble at 60% bass at 50%, and mids at 75%. I use the bridge pickup on a stock Jackson RR3 with the tone knob about 80%. That's all I can say.
p3916
aV[Hey, I did a video on tone like you asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalmusicians/comments/2n4zia/functional_significance_of_tone_in_black_metal/)\u000a\u000aI didn't go into specific details about my personal tone settings, but if you're curious:\u000a\u000aMy Amp is a Vox Valvetronix AD100VT-XL. [Specs and description](http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ad100xl.html). It is a high gain tube preamp/solid state hybrid which includes [preset amp models](http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/xl_overview)\u000a\u000aThe model I use is "Black", coincidentally. It was not designed for black metal, but for "Black Album Metallica" apparently (just learned that . . .). I can't actually tell you how that part works. But I can tell you about my knobs.\u000a\u000aI have my Bass in the middle, Treble at about 60%. Traditionally, someone would scoop the mids but I boost mine to about 75%. Guitar side, I have a stock Jackson RR3, and I use the bridge pickup, a Seymour Duncan JB TF-4 (For the record, I don't know jack about the details of any of this stuff). I have my volume knob at max, and my tone know at about 80% (I kind of just eye it, turn the knob to max and then dial it down about a quarter turn).\u000a\u000aNot sure if you can get anything out of this since you probably don't have the same gear, but I hope it helps. Trial and error pretty much got me to where I am.

aVThis quote from Ira Glass always comes to mind when people bring this up:\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d
p3950
aVdon't be afraid to start fresh.  if you feel like the song doesn't have direction it's probably good to just trash it.  however, if you think it has potential then maybe keep hacking at it, take whatever you like and change anything you don't like.  it's not done when you have nothing left to add, it's done when you have nothing left to take out. (some famous writer said that, I forgot who)
p3951
aVSometimes.  We're all our own worst critic, and it's tough to block it out.  When I find myself becoming overly critical of what I'm writing, I'll take a break.  Anywhere from five to fifteen minutes, just long enough to get it out of my head.  I'll also listen to something that I know inspires me, either for it's musicality or the production, and try to really pinpoint what it is that keeps me repeating that certain part or song in my head.  Usually a clear mind or fresh ears can help.  But if I feel like I'm 'stuck' on a part, or want to expand on a riff, I like to take one fundamental aspect of that riff or whatever and slightly change it.  Time signature, tempo, rhythms, harmonies can all be altered somehow. Taking out a couple notes here and there to get a syncopated/off-time feel, or slowing the tempo down and add a few extra rhythms/chugs/etc.

aVThere's a quote by Doc Hammer that I love that deals with this.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo be able to get good at something, just devour this idea, to be able to get good at something, you have to actually have the drive to get better at something. So that implies that you know that you suck.\u000aSo to get better at something, you already have to be charred with self loathing. It\u2019s the nature of the beast. [\u2026] Okay so now what you\u2019ve got to do, you\u2019ve already go self loathing down, so this is what you do. You create something. Create something and you despise it, now if you look at it and go \u201cit\u2019s wrong\u201d you\u2019re halfway there. If you look at it and go \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, BECAUSE,\u201d you\u2019re there. Okay?\u000aSo then you do it again. And if you look at that one and go \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t know WHY it\u2019s wrong, but I still know it\u2019s wrong,\u201d again, you\u2019re half way there. So you create another painting to solve that problem.\u000aThat\u2019s all it is.\u000aIt\u2019s hating everything you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d

p3957
aVThanks! It was one of those scenarios where I was thinking to myself - what do you do on a LYRIC music video when there are no lyrics? I looked at a bunch of other bands, and they just panned across some static artwork or somesuch, which I thought was pretty boring. Hence the switching between lyrics &amp; live video. \u000a\u000aIt's a little weird, but I think it's better than the alternative?

(lp3979
VDisclaimer - this is 100% my opinion, and may sound a little bit harsh.\u000a\u000aI'll start with the choice of genre.\u000a\u000aDeathcore is, quite frankly, the nu-metal of the 2010s. The only -cores worth your time are mathcore and grindcore. A good NxDx or Repulsion cover would sound great on a demo. Covering stuff like Dillinger is great if you can do it, but it's very difficult. I think choice of genre is why you're getting downvoted so heavily here.\u000a\u000aThe person doing the high vocals has a great, punchy voice for Grind/Powerviolence. Check out ANb's [Agorapocalypse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMoRrk95H5M) for excellent vocals.\u000a\u000aIt'd be nice if you could try and get a bit more "snarl" with the guitar tone - make it nastier. The mix is way too bassy; it's really muddy. You could do much more for the bass guitar by making the mix less bassy - I always find it a hallmark of a great mix when I can *hear* the bass well, like on [Eater of Birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1Zl3w23oE), an outstanding album by Black Metal duo Cobalt.\u000a\u000aThe drums are frankly fuckin' boring. I can't tell if it's a drum machine or a heavily triggered drummer or *what*. If it's drum programming, you'll want to do two things.\u000a\u000a1) Listen to Agorapocalypse and read interviews with Scott Hull, especially the bits where he talks about drum programming. The drums are all programmed on that album. The programming is godly. Scott Hull is the god of drum programmers. Actually, you might want to make a shrine to him in your house /s (but it couldn't hurt anyway)\u000a\u000a2) Go on youtube and watch. videos. of. actual. drummers. Y'know what they call a bad metal drummer? A drummer that listens only to metal. Go out there and watch stuff from guys like Buddy Rich, Benny Greb, Stanton Moore, Stef Broks, Eloy Casagrande, and Jamie Saint Merat to get a feel for interesting drum parts, both in metal and out. Then, apply those new things you've learned to the programming. If you have a friend who's a drummer, they can help you out too.\u000a\u000aIf you have a real drummer, tell them to make their parts more interesting: Blast beats (with very few exceptions) shouldn't be just right hand on hi-hat, left hand on snare, rf lf alternating. You need to Accent! Your! Blasts! Use ride bells, China cymbals, crashes, everything!\u000a\u000aThat's really all I have.

Also, I must commend your mixing. I can hear absolutely everything, but it still has impact and heaviness. That said, I think you could fatten up the mix a bit and it would still work, but good job!\u000a\u000aMy only major complaint is that the drums sound programmed. I know they are, but they shouldn't sound it. I'd mess with the velocities a bit,  put accents in places; little things to make it seem human.

p3990
aVAh, my mistake.\u000a\u000aHonestly I can't imagine not being able to use plugins.\u000a\u000aI would honestly try to get ahold of a DAW that allows plugins, however I'm saying that without any hands-on knowledge of Studio One/Hydrogen.
p3991
aVYeah I'm getting cubase now. 
p3992
aVIf cost is no matter, buy a real DAW.  Reaper is dirt cheap, or just buy a full version of studio one.  
p3993
aVYeah I'm looking into "buying" cubase. Everyone I know uses it so I should just give up on studio one... yet another DAW to get used to.
p3994
aVYou should just buy a copy without hinting at pirating it.  I did and it was well worth it.
p3995
aVI'd do that. I'd love to do that. But if I had that kind of money I'd buy a decent 4x12. I'm a dirt poor student and can barely afford petrol to get to school and back. If I ever have that amount of money and actually like and use the software I'll buy it. But until then I have to make do and being poor doesn't change the fact that I am a perfectionist. I'll never be satisfied with a decent drum sound. I need a great sound. Seriously, I have trouble sleeping at times when I'm up late recording and not being able to perfectly ace it. My dad is a software developer so I know that it's bad to pirate. I hate having to do it. But there's no other way for me.
p3996
aVWhy did you state "cost is no matter"?  That's the exact opposite of "dirt-poor student".\u000a\u000aGo pirate a copy of cubase 5.1.  I used it for a while before I bought c7.5.  It's 32bit and that can cause issues but it works fine. 
p3997
aVBecause I knew I had to pirate anyway so I might as well get the best stuff. I think I downloaded cubase 7 or something. I'll try it when I get on my laptop tomorrow 
p3998
aVIf you downloaded "cubase 7" I'd scan the shit out of it before double clicking.  My understanding is that no one has publicly released a crack for the usb licenser used with cubase 6 and later.

asVhigh output pickup guitar through pod hd pro clean tones always come out a little crunchy, never shimmery. please help.
p4016
(lp4017
VA hot pickup is going to hit the preamp harder and may cause a little distortion. If you are DI'ing for recording, check settings and make sure the gain is low in the preamp as well as the channel volume. Use the master to increase overall volume for your setting and save it that way. It will take some tweaking to get volumes balanced between the dirty and clean tones. If you are running this live into an amp, there are a few ways to set it up. If you run the HD into the standard input, the HD's signal will be amplified by the amps preamp an will increase the gain structure, possibly causing unwanted distortion. Tweaking this setup like the DI setup will be required. You can also plug it into the effects loop like a standard pedal. The preamp will color your tone, you can use your amps channels, but the HD's dirty tones will sound weird in this setup. If you bypass the amps pre by plugging into the HD, and running that into the effects loop return on the amp, your tones will be cleaner since you have removed a massive gain stage from the setup. This however doesn't let you use the amps channels and is only using the power amp stage of the amplifier to up the output to the speakers. Try all 3 and see what you like.

aVUse the pad on the HD Pro. It's the third button at the bottom below the mic power/high pass filter buttons. Also remember that the HD Pro by default sets itself to +18db input volume. You can change those settings on your computer's audio device setup tab. Also bear in mind that compressors, any drive at all, and the master volume on the POD amps all add a little distortion. Try fiddling with the deep fx parameters to turn those things down as much as possible, and compensate with more volume on the amp. Try [watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYMYbnQ_U2o) and see if you can get an approximately similar tone.

p4022

VStraight off the bat, you do not sound like Iron Maiden but that's okay, cos you do have a style.\u000a\u000aYou have a lot of lead lines, laying down that kind of "melodic" thing, but the rhythm part is really simple and remains pretty much the same thing throughout all of "Demolition of the Crystal Lattice". That's not a bad thing, one of my songs that I wrote when I was a lot younger is the same thing over and over for like 2 minutes of the song. It just seems like t's stuck between being epic leads or this super heavy grunge thing. I'm not sure whether to head bang from the waist or to jump up and down and yell.\u000a\u000aOkay so after the solo I'm kind of bored of this song. I like the individual elements of this, I'm not sure if I'm sold on the vocalist yet, but he's definitely doing what he's doing well. But I've heard this already now and I'm ready for it to finish.\u000a\u000a\u000aRight okay, the torch of truth. \u000a\u000aThis is definitely more my kind of thing, but I'd have sped it up 150% and doubled up on the drumming because I'm like that. But this is good. I'm a lot more invested in where this song is going. Again, the vocalist is good I just don't know how I feel about him on top of all these lead lines. He's super heavy, but I'm not really hyped. The instruments are hyping me up, but the vocals aren't finishing me off. \u000a\u000aThe bridge I mean, for me it's just a bit samey. I get what you're going for on the octave guitars but I'd have brought the drums back to half time and then gone into full time maybe? Or halved the length. The drum lines are very simple, and tht's fine, but I'm expecting fills that aren't there. \u000a\u000aThis is definitely my favourite of the two songs posted. The production is very good for a band with 96 likes on facebook. How did you pull this off? Was it free?

But as long as you have a guitar in your hand, bits and pieces of that epic masterpiece in your head will actually find their way into your songwriting.
p4055
aVWhile I am being tongue and cheek. My point is that one should be relaxed and practice basics such as scales to a metronome. Maybe practice a different scale or a regular scale in a different key. \u000a\u000aGetting over writers block for me usually means improving my skill as a guitarist in some fashion however minor. Usually it helps not to over think what you're doing and just enjoy what you're doing. \u000a\u000aSmoking weed, or having a drink or being sober is there just help you be in a comfortable mood to enjoy playing or relax you before you work on something.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to writing, I'll get high and jam around and maybe come up with a basic song structure and then I'll be sure to be completely sober as I begin to work the song out.

p4064
aVActually if you wanted to get into extreme metal this would be a great start.\u000a\u000a\u000aFor learning metal as a whole, A lot of people start with Judas Priest. Mostly everything from British Steel is a piece of cake. Living After Midnight is practically a power chord and timing exercise, and speaking of which, you should understand the importance of exercises as much as learning riffs. Get into the habit of **using a metronome** and counting to four with everything. Take your time and play just one scale and riff pattern a day you find difficult really slowly so that your goal is to hear each note ring out clearly and fluidly instead of at breakneck speeds. I'll list some more suggestions including some of my favorite easy to play songs.\u000a\u000a.\u000a\u000a\u000aMotorhead - Killed By Death, Over the Top, I'll Be Your Sister\u000a\u000aJudas Priest - Breaking The Law, Grinder, You've Got Another Thing Coming, Take These Chains\u000a\u000aBlack Sabbath - I, After All, Paranoid, Symptom of the Universe, Neon Knights\u000a\u000aVenom - Welcome to Hell, In League with Satan, Schizo, Warhead (this one is super fun and easy!)\u000a\u000aEntombed - Say it in Slugs\u000a\u000aChurch of Misery - Badlands\u000a\u000aDarkthrone - Quintessence\u000a\u000aCeltic Frost - Dethroned Emperor, Jewel Throne, Os Abysmi Vel Daath, Progeny\u000a\u000aMost everything by Saint Vitus, and most doom bands for that matter.

aVBreaking the Law by Judas Priest is pretty much the go-to beginner metal song.\u000a\u000aI'd also recommend:\u000a\u000a[Whiplash by Metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPh_9sRJycI) - Start to work on palm muted tremolo like picking\u000a\u000a[Am I Evil? by Diamond Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMvSSLZPC9w) - Really easy rhythm part that's fun to play. You can ignore the into solo, but it's an easy one to try when you feel you are ready.\u000a\u000a[10,000 Years by High on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6nnQfItmBc) - Easy riffs that rock really hard and will help you work on sliding.\u000a\u000aAll those songs should have good tabs up. If you want a good one for 10,000 Years you can message me and I'll send you a guitar pro file or a PDF\u000a

aVI started out learning black sabbath riffs. Simple, fun to play and who doesn't love sabbath? 
p4074
aVgoing to do this.. .seems like a good way to learn metal music
p4075
aVIron Man - Black Sabbath (There's really no other answer than this)\u000a\u000aParanoid - Black Sabbath \u000a\u000aEnter Sandman - Metallica \u000a\u000aSymphony of Destruction - Megadeth\u000a\u000aFor Whom the Bell Tolls - Metallica\u000a\u000aThese are the first songs I learned. They're all really easy but in the first stages of guitar, everything will be difficult. Don't be discouraged. Even if you "master" one part of these songs, trying to learn them will help you out in future songs.
p4076
aVI taught myself using guitar pro and downloading tabs for songs for it. Just download your favorite songs and you'll learn soon enough which ones are out of your ability to play. It's nice because you can set the song speed to half or even slower and then just work your way up to playing it faster.

aVIt's bloated and the RSE doesn't even sound that good and you just wish they would stay on Guitar Pro 5 forever :(
p4081
aVGood suggestions in this thread already, and I see someone recommended Metallica's black album in the other thread. If you like AC/DC, they'll help you get some basic open chords down (or alternatively Priest's "Living After Midnight" like UltimateSasquatch suggested). Once you've gotten one down, the rest will come easily because the same handful of chords are so common. Whatever you start with, don't try the whole song at once; work on one riff at a time, get it clean, and piece them together later, perhaps focusing on getting the transitions clean.  \u000a\u000aFor working on speedy, syncopated riffs, older Metallica riffs in "Disposable Heroes" and "One" are good exercises. (I'm not recommending either of those songs in their entirety as beginner material, but they include single-note speed-picked riffs that will let you focus on your picking hand without worrying about fret-hand stuff.)  \u000a\u000aWhen you want to try a lead, consider giving some old Black Sabbath a shot. The solo in "Paranoid" is pretty easy and will help familiarize you with the pentatonic scale.
p4082
aVWhen I was first learning guitar, the first song I actually learned fully was Beast and the Harlot LOL \u000a\u000aDethklok has a lot of really awesome and amazing riffs that aren't too difficult like Go Forth and Die, Fansong,  and Castratikron.
p4083
aVFirst thing I learned was the Pulling Teeth intro on bass.
p4084
aVGreat pinky workout.
p4085
aVFirst metal song I learned and practiced was Master of Puppets. It really gets you accustomed to down picking quickly and isn't that hard of a song to get down. If you want to practice a bit on the higher frets you can play the intro to the solo, it helps you get a feel for playing the higher notes. Also, Jump in the fire and Seek and destroy are great songs to practice as well. 
p4086
aVCrazy Train. The answer is Crazy Train. That riff teaches several important fundamentals and it sounds bad ass.  
p4087
aVThe opening clean riff in One by Metallica is the first riff I ever learned.  Metallica is good for getting power chords down.  \u000a\u000aI'd suggest learning some classic rock stuff too to help with other chords.  I learned some Skynyrd and Pink Floyd and it helped with other chords.  \u000a\u000aAfter Metallica, though, I learned Before I Forget by Slipknot.  \u000a\u000aYes, I started playing guitar in the Guitar Hero uprising.\u000a\u000aEdit: words.  
p4088
aVJust don't do what I did...\u000a\u000aWelcome to Bucketheadland is NOT  a beginner-friendly song.
p4089
aVA bit random but my first riff on an electric guitar was "Too late for love" by Def Leppard. After that I think it was the intro and verse of Metallica's Sanitarium.
p4090
aVYou can learn the whole "Thrashzone" by D.R.I. in one day. \u000a\u000aEarly Destruction and "Agent Orange" by Sodom are also easy. 
p4091
aVEn Ås I Dype Skogen by Darkthrone is one of the easiest metal songs I've ever learned. It's just a few chords played repeatedly through the song, but it's really fun\u000a\u000aEDIT: spelling

aVNot really dude. Solid stuff.
p4100
aVFuck your guitar sounds heavy! I like the riffs, but I really liked your guitar tone, very responsive and tight, what's you're setup?
p4101
aVWell right now I'm playing an Explorer through an apogee duet.\u000aThe program I am using to get the tone is the free version of Amplitube Metal that came with an iRig I got. 
p4102
aVIt sounded really good!

asVFor tonehounds, I made some match EQ impulse responses for Revocation's Deathless and The Haunted's Exit Wounds
p4105
(lp4106
VThis stuff is fun, and I will probably try these out.  But I feel like IR matching album tones is missing something.  If any compression or overdrive was added during the mix, can an IR match capture these?  I'm thinking no...
p4107
aVThere isn't really much reason to ever compress distorted guitar tones, and overdrive should be included through your amp sim of choice long before the cab stage. At any rate, you are correct- it's not perfect, and doesn't capture dynamics- but if you choose the same type of amp for a sim that the player used (here I matched a 5150ii with Dave Davidson's 5150iii, so they're close enough, but I will admit Ola uses a Randall Satan, so the drive won't be the same) it's pretty darn close. It's a usable studio tone with some tweaks at least, and that's all it's really supposed to be; it won't substitute for $2500 amp modeling units.
p4108
aVPoulin also has a free convolver!
p4109
aVWhy on earth would you want to sound like Revocation? Davidson is a killer guitar player but he's got to have one of the most generic tones of all time.
p4110
aVI dunno, I thought the production on Deathless was amazing. And fwiw, 90% of metal players are just using a 5150 of some sort into a cab with an SM57 anyway, so it's only generic if you consider 90% of metal tones to be generic. It has a scratchy high-end reminiscent of an ENGL cab that makes it very interesting to my ears.\u000a\u000aAlso, if you don't like it, don't download it, ya douche. 
p4111
aV&gt; so it's only generic if you consider 90% of metal tones to be generic\u000a\u000aWell today they sure are

VAs /u/SolomunKull said, it's severely let down by the mix and especially the drums. I don't know what software you use but there is enough freeware available to get a much better sound than you currently have. You might want to consider reading up on metal production techniques - there's a lot over on the Andy Sneap forum on Ultimate Metal.com, for example.
p4123
aVDo bear in mind the audio quality on both soundcloud and bandcamp is awful,  Havent had any complaints about the actual mp3's yet. I've gotten similar complaints about all the online files though, it sounds a lot more grainy and hardly any bass. I have gotten a lot better at mixxing but there's only so much i can do. It's just a demo EP but again, i do see your point. I'll check out the forums. Thank you
p4124
aVIt's not the audio file quality that's the problem, it's the mix, the tone, the panning, etc. I've heard plenty of bass-heavy mixes online so it's not Soundcloud stripping that out, for example. I appreciate it's only a demo EP but people judge you on what you release and standards expected of demos are a bit higher these days. 
p4125
aVOkay, i have a lot to learn about mixing, That is obvious. Trying to learn as much about it as possible but it's a slow process. Messing around a bit now with cubase and i can make some slight improvements but i'm clearly not a master at this. I see why bands let other people do this, haha. 
p4126
aVI like the songwriting, but the production and programming of the drums turns me off.
p4127
aVThank you, It's the best i can do at the moment sadly. It sounds a lot better on actual mp3 i'll add but i do see your point. I do play drums myself but properly recording it is way beyond my budget.  I hope it's something i can improve on in the future if i sell a few copies . Thanks for the feedback
p4128
aVReading a lot of people getting similar complaints when using these uploads. The bandcamp download was uploaded in the highest possible audio quality but both bandcamp and soundcloud play everything in 128kb/s max . I am trying to work on improving all the time so i appreciate the feedback. The mix didnt ever really bother anyone so i was just looking up what the problem could be. It's probably a bit of both
p4129
aVIt's not the mixdown quality of the file, it's the actual mixing/mastering of the music itself.  It just doesn't suit the music as well as it could, and that's a shame because you've written some pretty decent tunes there.  Do you have the original session files still?  If it's a drum machine, you can just swap out the old beats for new, more humanized beats.
p4130
aVI'm reading up on how to improve the drum sound now. Mixing and mastering is something i just had to teach myself and with that comes the problem of overlooking a lot of things. I wrote all drum tracks in midi and coverted them with cubase into an actual drum track. That's about the extend on my knowledge so far. If you have any tips on this feel free to send me a message on reddit or the facebook page
p4131
aVA lot of *my* issues with the way the mix sounds have to do with the actual samples used in the drum kit, and the mix of the vocals.  Everything else seems pretty decent, except the guitars seem flat at times because there's not enough panning to make room in the mix.  The drum you've used sound very fake, and you can get drum samples that sound more realistic. \u000a\u000aDo you still have the drum midi files?  If so, I'd love to play around with them and see if I can't get you a better sounding kit. Then I can export the lossless .flac files and you can remix your tracks using those instead of the one you've used.\u000a\u000aRegrading the vocals, well.. They seem to airy, and are too prominent in the mix.  A bit of eq, and maybe some reverb paired with compression, would really help.\u000a\u000aI think you've got an amazing ep here, and I hope to hear more of your work in the future.  Excellent songwriting, man! Very impressive for a first release.  Makes me excited for what's coming down the line.
p4132
aV&gt; because there's not enough panning to make room in the mix\u000a\u000aExactly. Pan rhythms hard left and hard right unless you have a good reason not to. Bass and leads down the centre.
p4133
aVTrying to get a hang of panning now but it's confusing me quite alot. Hoping i can get good at it and just reupload the tracks
p4134
aVPanning is quite simple, here's a set of panning guidelines:\u000a\u000a* Rythm guitars = 100% left, 100% right\u000a* Bass, vocals, leads, kick, snare =  0% Center\u000a* Crash, rides, cymbals, toms = Pan them outwards as you like them. listen to your favorite mix and replicate the panning.\u000a* Harmonized leads/double leads = I use around 30/30 L/R.\u000a\u000aThe goal here is to free up space so the sound isn't all garbled up in the middle and gets really hard to listen to.\u000a\u000aEDIT: If you have the rawtracks and drum MIDI i'd love to give it a spin mixing it.
p4135
aVnot only should you be panning, but learn how to EQ that shit and make an amazing guitar tone:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6PHzkPjH7c\u000a\u000aThis 5 minute video showed me how to mix guitars more than any other long ass read or constant fiddling. But again, you need to work on the drums aspect, especially when using programmed drums. Try to either invest ^^or ^^pirate in a good drum program.
p4136
aVThanks a lot, it does mean a lot to me to see someone actively trying to help me. I'm not  good with handling feedback but i've been getting great responses here. I still have everything. If you have facebook just send me a message on the page and i'll send them. I have just discovered an entire new area in cubase and the drumsound has improved A LOT by just picking a different kit and fucking around with the equalizers, but i could always use help on my  vocal mixing. It's something i've gotten a lot better in since the first song.
p4137
aVUpload the files somewhere send me a private message with a link to the drum midi.  I can't guarantee they'll be better than what you've been able to come up with in Cubebase, but I'll give it a shot.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure how much help I can be with the vocal tracks.

VI think you guys have definitely gotten off to a good start. As far as the sound goes it sounds a lot like killswitch engage. Some criticism would be that the vocals are way too high in the mix along with the lead guitar.  At several points the drums are borderline inaudible . However I think this stuff can be fixed and I wouldn't mind hearing it again with a better mix/master.
p4143

aVIt's not a typo, I'm interested in knowing what kinds of classical music metalheads are inspired by. Does anyone else here play classically?
p4168
aVI did classical percussion performance in college and I like to think that most of the stuff I played influenced me...the first one that comes to mind, oddly enough,  is [Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quJjqZprGu0), which is a minimalist piece by Gavin Bryar that just builds and builds, repeating the same refrain over and over. Amazing piece.\u000a\u000aAlso, certain percussion ensemble pieces. [Sharpened Stick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkNq5Ddsa8U) for one. Brett William Dietz is a pretty awesome modern composer.\u000a\u000aOthers:\u000a\u000a* [Bach - Double Violin Concerto in D minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4LFjuWvwzw), which I was fortunate enough to play as a double vibraphone concerto with marimbas accompanying.\u000a\u000a* [Carmina Burana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXFSK0ogeg4) by Carl Orff - total classic, very metal\u000a\u000a* [Holst's The Planets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmk5frp6-3Q) are great, also very metal\u000a\u000a* Stravinsky's [Firebird Suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZkIAVGlfWk)\u000a\u000aThe list goes on...Chopin, Bartok, Brahms, Beethoven, the Russians. All great stuff.\u000a\u000aThe main band I play in is really influenced by classical in general. Lots of keyboards and orchestration. So I'm pretty happy about that :).\u000a
p4169
aVI a very much enjoy Glenn Gould playing Beethoven pieces.\u000a\u000aAlso Erik Satie but a lot of pianists playing Satie do it in a way that I don't enjoy as much.\u000a\u000aThe Planets orchestra by Holst is awesome as well.  I'm surprised not many metal fans know or dig this.  Go listen to it all right now.  Especially like Mars.  There's a lot of dark ambient-like parts as well.
p4170
aVSatie is fantastic! 
p4171
aVI played in guitar ensemble for a couple years and we played a lot of Bach, so that is going to be my final answer.

sVHow to double track distorted open chords without sounding like Deafheaven?
p4180

VThe best thing you can probably do is to lower the gain and bass on each take and pan them a bit further.

aVI have them almost hard panned, but I'll try it out. Unfortunately I can't really get too great of a cleaner tone with the POD.  Thanks for the advice though, man!

p4184
aVHey thanks! I actually barely even listen to Mastodon haha, but I can see where you're coming from.  \u000a\u000aThey are panned at like 90 each I think right now, so I'll try all the way.  Unfortunately I can't get a great tone less distorted than that, the POD gives me trouble with cleaner tones.  I guess it might just be that.\u000a\u000aWell thanks for the advice and compliment!
p4185
aVNice riff / tone I'm trying to get a pod hd500x
p4186
aVThanks man. I just got the 400 from my brother, still figuring it out. The 500X is supposed to be really nice from what I've heard.
p4187
aVFirst off I like the riff, very cool chords going on. For chords beyond power chords to sound clear with downtuning you're going to want to lower the bass and gain, maybe jack the mids a little more than you're used to, and tune religiously. Maybe some clearer pickups would help too, I find D Activators to be pretty clear although high-output. Another thing to think about would be to voice your chords differently, I like to play a simple C major triad like:\u000a\u000a\u000a------------------\u000a\u000a------------------\u000a\u000a--------9---------\u000a\u000a--------x---------\u000a\u000a--------10-------\u000a\u000a--------8---------\u000a\u000aBasically the idea is that the farther apart your notes are spaced the less they will clash with high gain. You could even split a big chord up between the two guitar parts for extra clarity.
p4188
aVThanks for the compliment!  I actually have an Ibanez with Bareknuckle Nailbombs in it that I plan on throwing heavier strings on an using for this tuning since they have incredible note separation and clarity.  This was recorded on an Epi LP Standard with EMGs, so that should definitely help.\u000a\u000aIn terms of splitting pieces of the chords into different tracks, could you give me an idea of how you would go about that?\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, when you say voicing the chords differently, do you mean just in revoicing the chords in general, or using different voicings for each track?
p4189
aVYeah I bet the BKPs will help a lot with this riff, have not used them myself but have heard nothing but great reviews with regards to clarity. I used to use EMGs all the time but I just grew to dislike the sound of the 81, no warmth and low clarity. I did like my 60 in the neck for a fat lead tone but again not particularly clear for chords.\u000a\u000aFor splitting a chord, say you want to play a complicated sounding chord like a Cmaj7add9 (not actually sure if this would be the right way to name it but I hope you know what I mean.) For one guitar you could use this shape:\u000a\u000a--10--\u000a\u000a--8--\u000a\u000a--9--\u000a\u000a--9-\u000a\u000a--10-\u000a\u000a--8--\u000a\u000awhich is going to be a bitch because of the semi-barre on the 9th fret. You could split it up in several ways, I think a cool-sounding way is to change the chord voicing so that you get a tight interval (7-9, 7-8, 8-9, or 7-8-9 of the chord are the ones I'm talking about) and split it between the two guitars. This is because close intervals like minor 2nds (between the 7 and the 8) give this "screecher" sort of sound on one guitar with high gain, which is actually pretty sweet for a certain effect in breakdowns or whatever, but to get the whole chord across you're better off splitting them up. So maybe you'd choose to split the chord like this:\u000a\u000a\u000a--8-------x     \u000a\u000a--8-------12\u000a\u000a--x-------12\u000a\u000a--9-------12\u000a\u000a--10------x---\u000a\u000a-----------8--\u000a\u000awhich seems to me like it's gonna sound dope because of the close B-D and the high B-C intervals. So it looks like guitar left is playing some inversion of a Cmaj7 while guitar right is playing some sort of Cmaj7sus2.\u000a\u000aThis is also a cool thing to do if you just have the two guitars do different inversions of the same chord, or just play the same chord as each other an octave higher, it's going to sound really huge. So I guess I was talking about using different voicings for each track to answer your edit.\u000a\u000a

But you won't find them at the top selling lists...\u000a\u000aLook up music blogs. Google for an album you like with blogspot (or similar) added after it, then find the various blogs where it is available. Look at the latest post in those blogs (get the name and enter it into youtube: they might have a bandcamp too, which is a great way of buying new music). It's been my main way of finding music during the past two years, and it works great.\u000a\u000aFor example, if you're into At the Gates - With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness, search for [With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness blogspot](https://www.google.se/search?safe=off&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=With%20Fear%20I%20Kiss%20the%20Burning%20Darkness%20blogspot&amp;=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l=).

aVYou do realize that Lamb of God didn't get on any top lists until their 5th album? Everything up to Ashes of the Wake and part of Sacrament was awesome. Still is. Besides the shitty production As the Palaces Burn is an amazing metal album.

No one knows, but it doesn't matter because it's catchy. In the end, as long as your telling your story, that's all that matters. It's a form of art, a form of expression, and that's what's most important.

aVOne thing I've noticed about metal especially is that making literal sense or even rhyming aren't important it'd about the message being sent and how it's interpreted by the artist and the audience. If you like it and feel like it's what the song needs then go with. Make music for you not for anyone else. If it jives with you chances are there are a bunch of crazy bastards out there who will dig it too.

(lp4265
VSimple things that might help when you're going DI.\u000a\u000aNo idea on your amp but start out around 5 6 8 for bass mid treb and adjust until you think it sounds better. Keep the gain at the lowest you gain to do everything you need. Throw a HP and LP on the tracks you're recording and do at least 2 tracks hard left and hard right. Got any samples to show? \u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: If you're unhappy with Logic for whatever reason check out Reaper

p4267
aVIts try lowering the gain a bit and maybe the treb if you still get that high hiss/buzz notch it out with eq
p4268
aVYou could get a used peavey vypyr and go with Reaper as your DAW, I have that set up (including an Ibanez GRG121EX) and I think my tone is quite tolerable. Check my profile to find some of my music (would link but I'm on mobile -_-) it does require a lot of trial and error to find a tone you like enough to record with unless you already have an amazing rig.
p4269
aVLogic Pro is about 1000 times better than reaper. So probably just stick with that if you got it. 
p4270
aVA DAW is a DAW it doesn't matter which one you use. I constantly switch between Pro Tools and Reaper depending on what I am doing for ease of use/plugins.
p4271
aVI would highly suggest eith amplitube or pod farm. Personally I use amplitube and I love it. 
p4272
aVGo here: http://lepouplugins.blogspot.com/ Get the free guitar sims. He's got a couple different amps that all sound really good. You will also need to grab the Cab sim as well. If you're not sure how to get it all working, there should be several vids on youtube to get you running. Also go here: http://www.tseaudio.com/software/x50v2 and  get the free TSE tube screamer and BOD bass overdrive. What are you using for drums?\u000a
p4273
aVNo one I know plays drums (or can but not very well), but I do have an electronic drum set that I found on the side of the road that surprisingly works! It doesn't have a usb, so it must be old. But another alternative to drums that I have is using the drum design and kits on a maschine studio. Worst comes to worst, I will use my friend's old drum set, but I would have to get a bigger interface and more mics.
p4274
aVLook into Steven Slate Drums and/or The Metal Foundry if you want to program the drums. I also highly recommend getting a good interface for everything you want to do.
p4275
aVIf you have Logic Pro X, just use the drum samples they have included. They don't sound all that bad and will definitely sound better than any live drums you'd record. Recording live drums is very difficult. If you have any cash, I strongly, strongly recommend EZ Drummer 2. 
p4276
aVRecording live drums is extremely easy where are you getting that it's difficult? It all depends on what sound you are going for and for metal I would go with a real kit or at least appropriate samples or it's never gonna mix well. SSD has really good kits for metal and there's also the Metal Foundry.
p4277
aVYeah your going to need pod farm or something, i know getting a good guitar tone is a fucking bitch.  There is some free vst plugins you could try TSE and LePoulin just youtube it
p4278

p4281
(lp4282
VFor listening to a record? while recording in a studio? For practice? Gigging out? Large stage, small stage, basement?\u000a\u000aIt's a good question, but you gotta be a bit more specific. 
p4283
aVYeah this is vague. Even if I were to assume you were talking about recording, I can only tell you so much. There is no magical number or shape that you can feed into an EQ module or program to get it to sit well in the mix. It depends on the tone you're getting from your amp. It depends on how clean or distorted it is. It depends on how many times you tracked it, whether or not you used a mic or went line in, what kind of equipment you used etc...\u000a\u000aGenerally speaking it's okay to clean up a tone by rounding off the extreme highs and lows, and unwanted frequencies (just google some frequency charts to get an idea of what you want.) If you duo-track it, one guitar should be a high shelf. If you quad-track, put a high shelf in each speaker and do another recording with a new tone. That's all I can really say about that. If you want someone to tell you exactly what to do, or to EQ your tone for you, that's not going to happen. Keep in mind there's also *a lot more* to good production than just EQ, panning, and volume adjustment.
p4284
aVSince this is vague, let me clarify. This is for using headphones. 
p4285
aVahh, well fuck my shit then
p4286
aVdepends on your headphones.. play around with the frequencies to see what sounds good
p4287
aVDepends on the mix you're listening to as well. As they say in audio engineering, the answer is always... Depends!
p4288
aVUsing headphones for what purpose ultimately?
p4289
aVUm, listening to metal? If I'm in the wrong sub, feel free to redirect me.
p4290
aVI don't see the point of EQing the music you listen too. I mean, I'd rather listen to the records the way they were made. That's why I pay so much money for good headphones.
p4291
aVThis sub is primarily geared towards people that are making metal music. Ideally, the music should be EQ'd correctly before it gets in your hands (obviously this is not always the case) and no one EQ setting is going to make everything sound better. \u000a\u000aYou would probably be better off investing in some decent headphones if anything

p4309
(lp4310
VI used to have a 2006 C-1 Hellraiser and I thought it was great for lead and rhythm.  Synester Gates (or however you spell it) from Avenged Sevenfold used one before he got a signature model.  Jeff Loomis used one for The Psalm of Lydia.  Wish I didn't sell that guitar!  It had the perfect balance of comfort, speed, and tone.  A friend of mine had a 2007 or 8 model and they had rounded the edges on the body... I thought that kinda ruined the tone... just my opinion.\u000a\u000aIf you aren't sure about it go find one and play it... I'm assuming you are talking about the C-1... they are pretty common if you include the other series' and they all have the same neck and body shape AFAIK.\u000a\u000aCould be worth checking out some ESP Horizons too... they generally have thinner necks and better quality.
p4311
aVI went to guitar center today and all they had was the C7 and the classic. I couldn't get a really good feel for it. They did feel different though. I did get my RG professionally tuned, so that may have something to do with it as well.
p4312
aVThe Classic has the same dimensions as the Hellraiser... it should feel the same to play.  But it has different construction and wood so it won't sound the same.
p4313
aVYou can shred with fat necks just fine, it's all in the angle, it doesn't make you slower or anything. Tone wise Schecters are a little beefier and not as sharp as typical 80's squeaky metal tones (at least with stock pickups). I have a schecter and I like it, but my understanding is that they're more value guitars, and there are better options if you want more flexible or more refined characteristics in a guitar. Again, good for the price, but not perfect. You shouldn't have any problems though, you can get great tones out of it.

p4329
aVYep, I'm quite aware that it's very repetitive and boring. I think it's at least a good thing that the solo has a different part. For the rest, I think one single song like this is doable, especially if it's really short like this. I wouldn't want to write an entire album of this stuff though.\u000a\u000aAnd of course, it works way better when played live. I'm mostly a big Sodom fan, and they have the shorter repetitive songs like Ausgebombt and Bombenhagel, but also longer and more complex stuff like Blood on your Lips and In War and Pieces. That's pretty much what I'm going for - some variation is key.

VI liked this. I had a comment about #4. I agree with you that it's more about how you play and less about the gear. But don't forget it's also about how your gear is set up and how you get the tone you do. Those are just as important. Because some people can get great tones from shit, and some people have no concept of tone with great equipment. So tone can be just important as skill. 
p4355
aVHey thanks for reading. Yeah I know what you mean, the gear sure is important. It's just that I've seen a lot of people recently posting about how they could never get such good tones and stuff without spending lots of money on the equipment that their favourite guitarists have. I agree with you though that if you know what you're doing, you can get a good tone out of pretty much anything.

aVTight drummer. Hard to hear the guitar work very clearly, but it sounds pretty good and tight. Is there no bassist? Breakdown was kinda cheesy, and while your singer has mostly a good voice (his high end is quite lacking/thin), I think his choice in patterns was fairly poor. Good potential here though

Don't take that as a particularly negative term, a breakdown is a breakdown whether it comes from a slam band or a hardcore band, it's just semantics.

p4378
aVOf the top of my head: The drums are really flat and get's buried beneath (the neat sounding) guitars and vocals. Especially the snare and bass drum needs to stand out more for it not to be as "messy sounding". But I like the song it self.
p4379
aVI tried listening to some Black Dahlia Murder and all I could hear in their mixes was snare and kick. I actually tried to turn them up volume wise but they're still in the bac loads, huh?\u000a\u000aAny idea how to remedy that?
p4380
aVThe trick isn't necessarily volume, but frequency. If the snares more "bass-y" parts is relatively louder than the higher parts, then it occupies the same frequency as the bass, bass drums, guitars or whatever and you can't hear it clearly. The same goes with all sounds in a mix really, you should think about them as being layered not only in volume but in frequency. So in short - try boosting the highs and maybe limiting the bass on the snare and doing the reverse on the bass drum. Also, panning is your friend. Spread your drumkit out, I usually set the snare and bass drums pretty much in the middle but the overhang (is this the right word?) mics hard panned left/right, and the same with the toms. The bass tom i usually pan 50% left or right. Bear in mind that I'm no professional and only dabble in Cubase but this is what I've heard. Good luck!\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: Fixed spelling etcetera.

asVRecording with a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 [x-post from r/audioengineering]
p4398
(lp4399
VHey, I have the Scarlett 2i4 which is the same thing with an extra set of stereo outputs and it's a great little box, so here we go!\u000a\u000a\u000a* 1 &amp; 3. I use a DI box but really only because I don't have any zero latency plug-ins for amp simulation, meaning there is a small delay from when I'm playing to when the sound comes out of my speakers. Usually it's only a few milliseconds, but depending on your play style and your own preferences the delay can really make it tough to record. I record with a DI and have my POD300 to use for monitoring. I'm not too big a fan of what comes out of the POD for amp sims so the DI is perfect. If you have a similar situation then the DI is a must. However, if you don't have any issues playing with latency or are perfectly fine playing and only hearing the dry guitar signal, then there's no need for a DI. You can plug the guitar directly into the 2i2 and set it to inst(rument). You want to use instrument when recording a direct guitar sound because it has a much lower output than a line level signal. The extra boost you get from it is for you guitar's signal to be properly converted to digital. If it's too hot then roll back the volume on the input, if it's still too hot the unit also has a pad which will lower the volume a bit. As far as I know though, the difference between the two settings is a volume adjustment, so if it's working fine when you have it set to line and still sounds fine after you've added effects there probably won't be too much of an issue. Don't be afraid to experiment! Record a few different tracks with line and instrument. Adjust the input volume on the Scarlett to work with each setting and treat it as you would in your DAW and go with what works best. If there's something I'm missing with the line vs instrument setting, someone please feel free to chime in.\u000a* 2. You're exactly right about the +48v button. It's typically used for condenser mics which are usually used for vocals, though you may use them for other things. These require power to be sent to them to operate, though they aren't necessarily the only ones that are like this. That button merely turns on phantom power which powers the mic through your XLR cable. \u000a\u000aHope this helps!
p4400
aVLast night, I recorded tracks in both the Line setting and the Instrument setting. I noticed that with Instrument, the sound was heavier and more distorted, but I could still hear quite a bit of hum and buzz in the track. When I used Line, the sound was clearer, but I had to the turn the gain knob up quite a bit to get a good, heavy sound. What I'm wondering is (aside from what VST plugins I'm using) what will happen if I plug the guitar into a DI box, take it's output, and send it to the 2i2 with an XLR cable as Line input? Will that make my guitar sound cleaner in the mix?
p4401
aVWhen using XLR, the scarlett ignores the line/inst switch completely so wherever that's set it won't matter. Using the DI is going to give you a lower signal than using the instrument input which will probably have a similar effect to using line in. Less distortion but very clear. your best bet is to use the instrument in with a noise gate somewhere in your effects chain to help tame some of the excess noise. Some amp sims have a noise gate built into them, so look for that, otherwise you recording software will likely have one included with it's plug-ins
p4402
aVI have a 2i4 so pretty much the same deal. The 2i2 IS your DI. Guitar -&gt; 2i2 -&gt; computer is how I do it. Then use something like Guitar Rig or Amplitube to add the amp modeling stuff. If you have an amp you want to use, then yeah mic it up and use the +48V (Phantom Power) on any condenser mics. Otherwise leave the +48V alone. Plug into the Inst channel with your guitar unless your pickups are crazy hot (my own opinion, just pick what sounds best for you).

aVThis is awesome. Played around on my acoustic in open Cm tuning for this  song, but I like your cover more. \u000a\u000aQuestion: What did you do to sync the video of you playing each track and put it together like that? I record with a USB interface and my webcam recording software can't share the input with Ableton when I'm recording. Splitting the headphone out on my amp to the mic input on my computer works, but with a lot of latency. My amp will not play through its speaker when the USB interface is running.
p4409
aVI use a USB interface to record all of the audio first.  I video tape the drum video while i record the drums.  Everything else is actually "lip-synced".  I have tried to film and record at the same time and it was the biggest pain in the ass in the world, so the much easier thing to do is just record the audio and then simply take a video of yourself playing along to it.  This allows for mistakes and allows me to focus more on having fun than on playing spot on correctly.  I know some people may feel pretending to play is lame, but It doesnt bother me cause obviously it's still me playing but it just makes life way easier.  Hope that helps!
p4410
aVPick-syncing, that's what we'll call it. That makes a lot of sense. At one point, I somehow had real-time audio to both Ableton and my webcam software, but I don't remember how I did it. I do remember it involving an inconvenient combination of patch cables and software to make a virtual audio card in Windows. \u000a\u000aOn a somewhat unrelated note, I just gave Ableton Live a test drive on an Ubuntu virtual image and it actually works (has a platinum rating on WineHQ, which means it works flawlessly). That might let me record to Ableton and a webcam program at the same time, given the flexibility of Linux audio configuration. Plus I'll finally get to ditch Windows entirely, as I've been using Ubuntu on my Chromebook for a while and love it.

p4458
aVNot really, but industry standard sample rates are 44.1kHz and 48kHz. The actual quality of what was recorded depends on a huge number of factors, from the quality of the mics and hardware used (even cables) to the preamps and type of recording interface. Now some stuff might sound low quality or quiet, but you won't really know until you've done some EQing, compression, etc. So don't let that fool you.

p4469
(lp4470
VUsually you can just layer a synth choir and a string sound. ;) These guys probably are using a preset on whatever particular keyboards they play, so it might be worth watching the videos to find out, then looking for a VSTi simulation of that instrument.\u000a\u000aFailing that, if you get a decent 3rd party synth there is almost always some preset that will do exactly what you need - either as-is, or with 2 sounds layered - because synth string/choir is a very obvious and common patch. I like the Native Instruments VSTs when searching for specific sounds because you can filter the presets by criteria such as 'Bowed Strings' and 'Vocal' which cuts down the time you spend looking.\u000a\u000aIf I want something realistic sounding, I use the choir patches in Symphonic Orchestra or Symphonic Choirs. Same for strings.\u000a\u000aHere's a free choir VSTi that I occasionally use if I'm not after realism: http://www.dskmusic.com/dsk-choirz/\u000a\u000aAs for synth strings, I use Massive, Absynth, or one of the various synths that come with Sonar.

p4484
aVFirst off thanks a lot! Now for the funny part . . .\u000a\u000a&gt;I think the low end needs defining, I need to hear the notes the bass is doing.\u000a\u000aThere is no bass. I don't want to use a programmed bass and I don't own a bass, so my solution was no bass. For the non demo (which I hope comes together eventually) there will be bass, and no I will not give it the Newsted treatment.\u000a\u000aThe drums are programmed using the worst drum machine in the world - guitar pro's RSE. It sucks due to the programs attempt at introducint "realism", where they have 2 drum sounds for every component (snare, bass, etc.) and the chance of a certain "hit" being played is probability based. The issue is that the sounds are not levelled, like 1 snare hit is louder than the other, and that's why it sounds like the snare is dropping in and out on blast beats every now and then. The "fix" that I imagine for this is to separate all the individual parts (bass, snare, cymbal) into 3 tracks before mixing and compressing each one so it is even.  Unfortunately, that's work that I don't really want to do.\u000a\u000aAgain, the (eventual) studio version will have a real drummer, so no worries there.
p4485
aVOh, perfect. I really enjoyed the music, tho, I am sorry I didn't comment on it at all. Sound is sound, for me, and music is music. \u000a\u000aI have done sound for many bands that forgo the bass and instead they use an octave pedal or something of the sort. Don't sound bad, tho.

(lp4492
VFirst of all, I really enjoyed some of these songs. Track 1, 2, "Spiders..." and the last one in particular. \u000a\u000aI wouldn't hesitate one second to call it straight up "heavy metal". There are some clear heavy 70's references throughout (think Deep Purple, Hawkwind, and the likes) and I could probably see you do a warm-up gig for a band like Grand Magus.\u000a\u000aOn a sidenote, I could use a better and more balanced mix. I think the guitar is a bit too dominant and "harsh"-sounding (yes, I know that sounds odd), and it drowns out the drums and vocals some places. It could be mellowed out a bit. MAybe it has excess mids?\u000a\u000aOther than that, good work.

Some of the tracks have preset effects with compression that we can't figure out :/ We're pushing the limits of the hardware too so it crashes and screws stuff up.\u000a\u000aThank you for your comment, I'm glad you like the music!

aVHad a listen this morning and that band (your band, yes?) is more what I'd expect from a modern metal band in terms of drumming/vocal style. So I guess the term 'metal' means whatever the zeitgeist is, whereas 'heavy metal' really indicates a more, um, retro sound?
p4499
aVThats what I was trying to get at, yes.

asVMachine Head Vocal Lessons?
p4517
(lp4518
VI know that before Unto the Locust, Robb got vocal lessons with Melissa Cross and his voice is better than ever! She does instructional DVDs called The Zen of Screaming. The 2nd one goes into a more detailed look into different styles, but the first one is necessary so you don't do any damage to your voice (which is incredibly easy to do if you're screaming the right way)
p4519
aVHighly recommend Zen of Screaming as well, but you can start by mimicking the sound of his harsh vocals. Try starting at a whisper level for a while. Eventually, start to push more air out of your diaphragm. Practice breathing exercises before you even think about this part.

aVI didn't really know what to call "our sound" so I just put down what someone who reviewed one of our shows labeled us. Regardless of the genre (and if you enjoyed it or not), thanks for listening! 
p4531
aVYeah, I'd agree with /u/UltimateSasquatch. Metalcore. \u000a\u000aNot that Metalcore is inherently band but it became so bloody saturated that it is really hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak. 
p4532
aVAgreed. Most of the demo was written a few years back and the metalcore influence was definitely stronger then. Our newer material sounds a lot more death/thrash influenced (but groovier) since we had a drummer change and everyone mostly grew out of the metalcore phase. Regardless, thanks for the listen! 
p4533
aVMy band, Dissentience, put out our first demo earlier this year on [our Bandcamp](https://dissentience.bandcamp.com), but we just made it available on Soundcloud. We're originally from Bethlehem, PA and basically fresh out of high school. Our influences are all over the place, but we've been called blackened death metal before. We're working on a second demo now (writing only so far, but sounding awesome!) which should be out sometime early-mid next year. If you like the demo, give us a like on [our Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dissentienceband)!

VVocals sound like they cut in at spots. Are you stopping the recording and then starting it up to record the next line or are you recording the whole thing at once? It sounds like option one.\u000a\u000aMy suggestion would be to keep two tracks to record the first time so you can blend things in case you fuck it up. 
p4541
aVWhat we did was chopping up the segments, so the vocalist could maintain energy and intensity throughout the track. Some of the parts were difficult for the vocalist, too, so re-takes were needed, and doing it from end to end would've taken aaaages.\u000a\u000aAlso, I manually gate the vocals. Not by a lot though, just so there's less than a beat of dead noise before and after the voice clip.
p4542
aV&gt; Also, I manually gate the vocals. Not by a lot though, just so there's less than a beat of dead noise before and after the voice clip.\u000a\u000aohhh, that makes sense. Can you try adding some slight pre-delay and post-delay? That may help because they do sound a little too choppy.
p4543
aVI'll do that the next time I have the song loaded into my DAW. :)

asVEpic and very atmospheric instrumental song by my project, Neutron Star
p4556
(lp4557
VWow, the part around 3:17 really grabbed my attention, took a while to build up to that stage but I guess that was the intention. You could try randomizing the velocity of the drum hits a bit, for example the ride and hi hat, because every time one of those drums is hit it sounds the exact same. It would sound more "real" if every hit sounded a bit different. Good structure for a long song, it held my attention. I'm not sure the "modern" sounding staccato breakdown parts work too well with the atmosphere of the rest of the song, maybe some Emperor or Opeth style riffs would fit better instead. Overall good job on a very ambitious song!

p4562
asVAddictive drums vs Superior drummer: which one is better?
p4563
(lp4564
VUsed both. Here's my opinion. \u000a\u000aAddictive Drums: if you want a kit that sounds like a miced kit with very little work? Bam. It's great for getting a fantastic sound quickly. My work flow is to build my sections until I am happy, then before I mix my whole track, I explode my midi to individual tracks, and transform them to audio. That way I get individual audio for snare, tom, kick etc. And then I compress and expand and reverb them as I see fit, like a real kit. It makes for a pretty chunky sound in a pretty easy way. \u000a\u000aSuperior Drummer: I have less experience here, as I don't own this, I've used elsewhere. The sample library is huge. If you want to tweak, this is tweak heaven. The issues for me were entirely work flow, and I think given time I would probably be able to get better results from this program, despite the overwhelming amount of choice. \u000a\u000aIf you are okay with it, I recommend tormenting both before you purchase. I did this when I bought Addictive Drums. I tried about 4 different options, and bought my favourite. :) 
p4565
aV*torrenting\u000a\u000aLet's not get too metal here...

aVHahaha! Autocorrect ist metal.

p4568
aVIs! I just woke up, and I was playing World of Tanks last night, doing hilariously bad German accents. I have it on the brain, clearly. 
p4569
aVWow it's been a long time since I played that haha
p4570
aVI fucking love that game. It's progressed a lot over the years. I'm on the NA servers as Senpai_Kun if you ever wanna get back into it! XD
p4571
aVcool, I even forgot my username though lol. If I get back into it I'll add you. 
p4572
aVCoolio! I'm in the RDDT main clan, so if you pop over to /r/worldoftanks anytime, and we have a teamspeak that should be in the sidebar. :) 
p4573
aVthe only problem I have with AD is that when I paste my midi to the DAW and load up AD, the midi is on different keys, ie, the cymbal on my midi program is a tom trigger on AD.\u000a\u000aThis was on AD1, I don't know if its corrected on AD2, but I would want to know beforehand because that was an inconvenience. \u000a\u000aEDIT: NVM I found out  you can edit the keymap in AD2. So I'm gonna get AD2 with the metal adpak, it just sounds... better to me, idk.
p4574
aVYus! You can edit the key map in AD1 as well! I have a map for my Maschine Mikro if I ever want to manually enter drums. \u000a\u000aFun store, punk band that me and my dad know had a gig. We knew the live engineer for the gig, and he used a Presonus desk! We got him to give us the recorded stems for the night, and we would mix them for the band. Great idea. \u000a\u000aWe didn't have the time code for the files. And I foolishly turned on stretch. Which meant... Oh nooooooooes. Everything was like 1.5 times speed. But as we had never seen this band live, we just thought "holy shit these guys are fast".\u000a\u000aThe live engineer we know is a typical sound guy. Almost no gain used and he slammed the faders for the live mix. Yay. So the drums sounded shite. I decided to trigger the drums into Addictive drums using gates as triggers and that worked well! Then the guys hear it and are like "uh, that's super fast." \u000a\u000aShit. So we get the speed about right and I retrigger everything. Except there is one point where the drummer is doing the Wipeout style floor tom hits, and it's too quiet and fast for my gate to pick up. I say screw it. Break out my Maschine, slow the track down and manually play his tom part, velocity and all, on the pads. Speed it up, he never knew the difference. \u000a\u000aAddictive Drums. For when you want to trigger a kit and have the musician never know! :D 
p4575
aVI can only speak about Tooktrack because I've never used Addictive Drums, but do NOT get Drumkit From Hell. It's been around so long, you can easily spot it on a mix. Now, of course that's just opinion but if you're showing off your mixes to fellow metal musicians and writers who use samplers, I'd worry about looking unprofessional\u000a\u000aHere's a suggestion: get EzDrummer 2 and the Metal Machine EXZ, or Made Of Metal EZX. You could also do with getting a MIDI loops pack from Toontrack as well since they feature Dirk Verbeuren, an amazing metal drummer.\u000a\u000aEzDrummer 2 is incredibly useful for writing. Superior Drummer 2 is all about tweaking the sounds. Both play EZX files. 
p4576
aVJust bought Ezdrummer 2 on the black friday sale. Do you recommend Made of Metal, Metal Machine, or Metal!?\u000a
p4577
aVI like metal machine because it's done by Sneap
p4578
aVYeah, that's a plus. 
p4579
aVMade of Metal is getting some major hype right now. I think it sound awesome. 
p4580
aVI know. The hype is there, but almost no reviews. I saw Ola Englunds demo and it sounded pretty beastly, just like everything else he demos. I'm looking for speed metal stuff. 
p4581
aVTools are all how you use them. I sampled my drummers kit and I've used it from death metal, djent, metalcore, alternative, rock and softer. It was a Pearl Masters kit though, so that may have accounted of its versatility. 
p4582
aVTrue... Nothing beats real drums, except maybe SD since they offer so many options. Do you just use midi loops or do you piano roll them or something?
p4583
aVTook the individual samples (1200+ when I finally narrowed it down) and made it into a Kontakt instrument. From there, I just piano roll it like anything else. Standard GM.\u000a\u000aHere's an example isolated:\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/obsydianx/metal-kit-01\u000a\u000aRock:\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/obsydianx/rock-11-23-14\u000a\u000aAlternative:\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/obsydianx/past-the-time-wip\u000a\u000aNote, however, that these drum sounds might not please everyone. To me, I love them. I could tweak then further if I wanted to but I found that they worked well for me.

asVMicrophones for harsh vox?
p4589
(lp4590
VSM57s work GREAT for harsh metal vocals, you may just be too close to the microphone. when your playing a show and you need to be that close thats fine, but in the studio (bedroom, basement, whatever) you need some distance between the sound source and the micrphone.\u000a\u000aid put your face about a foot away from the mic, maybe a smidge further, imagine theres a giant gout of fire pouring out of your mouth, Looks like a giant lighter, you want the microphone to be in the tip of that flame
p4591
aVThis! I have recorded harsh vocals with an SM57 and it has sounded pretty awesome (http://mothmanofficial.bandcamp.com/track/the-cleansing if you want to check it out. Although we ran it through a heavy load of pedals and a guitar amp for extra wtf haha)\u000a\u000aThat said, condenser mics are what you want if you would like even more clarity. Just put it through a solid compressor and you should get a much cleaner tone. The other songs on the link I put up were recorded through a condenser mic as opposed to a dynamic if you want to check it out.
p4592
aVIf you're getting a load of mud from the 57, try moving it further away. If you've got it about 4 to 6 inches away, with a popshield in between you and the mic, that should do the trick. \u000a\u000aThe 57's a favourite of mine on aggressive vocals, but if you do want to try something else (and you have phantom power available), the Audio Technica AT2020 is a damn fine mic for the price.
p4593
aVsm7b
p4594
aV+1 to the SM7B
p4595
aVI'm an amateur, so take my advice for what its worth. I use the [MXL V67](http://www.amazon.com/MXL-Large-Capsule-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000JRPYGE) for vocals. It's a relatively cheap condenser with a cardioid input pattern. It has a darker tone compared to similar mics (so i read), but for the most part I've haven't notice it enough to be a concern. In any case, i would look into condenser mics in general. 
p4596
aVI use this one too. Way better than you'd expect for $100, certainly worth the investment as your next mic if you only own a SM57. I use it for vocals and also get great room sounds for drums.
p4597
aVI've had great results with an Electrovoice RE20/PL20 (same microphone rebranded, I forget from which to which), which you might be able to find used within your budget.\u000a\u000aI've also had great results with an AKG C414 XLS, but that will most definitely be out of your price range - perhaps a more affordable alternative might be the SE Electronics se4400, which is very similar but not quite as bright; I've used it in place of the 414 before, just not on vocals.\u000a\u000aI've also heard people have quite good results with a Shure SM7B, which I've yet to try myself, but it's a broadcast microphone along the same lines as the PL/RE20, and again, might be within your budget used.
p4598
aVdo what Consider Phlebas said. edit: it'll provide better results than if you weren't doing it. If the vocals sound very muddy then in the EQ (I assume you're screaming) you want to cut out some of the bass frequencies and boost the upper mids and lower highs that'll retain the sharp/harsh/howly edge and cut out some of the mud. 
p4599
aVI've been using a SM58 (the same one) for about 12 years now. I've used the 57 and they are good but the 58 is just that much better in my opinion. The last recording I did we used a Beta58 and I'm more than impressed with it also. A brand new SM58 will run you around a hundred bucks.
p4600
asVBugera 1960........Budget Modern High Gain??!?!
p4601
(lp4602
VWow this sounds fantastic, especially considering your recording method (no offence) ..I remember looking at a bugera before settling on a Mesa 50 cal but now I'm starting to reconsider haha
p4603
aVHaha hey it's just taking the same preamp signal before it hits the power amp! People always talk about Bugera being unreliable, but I've used this on stage for 2 years no problems, and before that my buddy used it for a few years , not knowing that he was running the head at 16 ohms into a 4 ohm cab! Turns out he had been accidentally doing that for almost 2 years. So the high end amp people will say what they want about Bugera, but this thing has served me very well. 
p4604
aVSounds pretty good to me man. Did you mic a cab for this or is this recorded some other way?
p4605
aVI wish I had a cab to mic! I live in a second floor apartment so I would have unhappy neighbors on all sides haha. I did this with my new favorite trick: plug a garbage dummy speaker into the amp, plug the amps effect send into my DAW, and then connect a cable to the amps effect return but DONT plug that into anything- leave it hanging. Having the blank cable in the effects loop return tricks the amp into sending an empty signal to the power section, and just like that, silent tube amp recording that wont blow up your gear!
p4606
aVThat's awesome dude. My Laney ironheart studio head has an internal dummy load, so that saves me a lot of that hassle. 
p4607
aVOh damn, thats perfect! Are all Ironhearts like that or is yours modded? 
p4608
aVThe studio models come with it. Even more useful, it's got a USB Out, so you can record dirty tone and a DI at the same time, and reamp it later if you feel like it. Sounds awesome if you run it into a nice cab impulse from there :]
p4609
asVI'm really proud of this riff I made earlier. What do you guys think?
p4610
(lp4611
VHoly fucking shit yes. Just leave it dirty like that, I swear if you like compress the shit out of it I will punch you.

asV[GEAR]Sunn SL260 combo into 1980 Sunn 4x12. The 3/4 doom stack.
p4615
(lp4616
V2x12 solid state combo pushing 60 watts. It drives the 4x12 with plenty of power and is a two channel clean tone machine that loves to eat fuzz pedals. Enough volume on tap to get you wasted. \u000a\u000aIt has a mid boost frequency knob that actually eqs the sound. Bright switch is bright and the reverb is DEEP. Local craigslist score and I can't wait to ABY it with another more traditional stack.
p4617
aVNice find!  Because of the whole 60 watt thing you might find you need to push this pretty hard if you're putting it next to a 100 watt stack, but I bet it will sound killer.  Multiple amp combinations work wonders when nailing down meaty doom tones.  
p4618
aVIndeed it does need to get pushed to match a 100w stack but luckily it can take it. I've been finding all sorts of great tones with it already. I've got a buddy with a rig we're going to ABY test it with to see just how loud it can go.
p4619
aVWhat are you tuning to?  If it's low enough, you might check out running a rig through a bass cab with it, or even running a full bass rig.  I play a baritone tuned A to A most of the time, and I run a Sunn 1200s through an 8x10 along with a Laney GH100ti through a full stack, and the sound is a total doom crusher.  I also have a Peavey XXX that I run through a 2x15, and that sounds amazing paired with the full stack as well.  If you have the cabs around, a lot of guitar heads sound great through bass cabs for doom.  I know having a ton of gear lying around is not feasible in many cases, but if you live in a larger city you can score plenty of serviceable cabs off craigslist without breaking the bank.
p4620
aVI play an SG tuned to A. I had a 74 red knob model t but traded it for drums. I'm slowly working on getting a multi amp rig again. There's a sovtek mig 50 on my local craigslist for a fair price. I may scoop it up. I live in Seattle so there's no short of gear for sale haha.

(lp4623
V[deleted]
p4624
aVYea, I have to agree, a lot of the riffs are structurally useless, they just seem to be dropped in place without any thought given to the overall flow of the song. From about 2:00 - 4:57 sounds cohesive but the rest of it is just riff salad. On the up side, a lot of the riffs are pretty good, I am not a fan of the 'In flames'y string skipping' riffs but that's really just my opinion, I find that style of riffing has been done to death in recent years. There is potential, just keep working at it.
p4625
aVSorry, I don't hear much of the mastodon/ opeth influence. Also it kind of sounds like a bunch of random riffs to form a song. 
p4626
aVI like everything from 2:15ish to 4:55.  I certainly hear the Opeth influence in the riff at 5:15 with the lead over.  I dig it.  I agree with the other comments that there could be some smoother transitions but I think that middle section I mentioned is very strong.  The ending is kind of uneventful though.\u000a\u000aalso the guitar tone could use a bit less gain if you ask me. Just my taste though.\u000a\u000awould listen to again. keep at er, fellas.
p4627
aVI'm hearing way more All That Remains and Gothenburg roots than I am any kind of sludge or prog.\u000a\u000aSomething seems a bit funky with the guitar.\u000a\u000aAs others have said, it doesn't feel very cohesive. The opening in particular seems pretty riffy without much of a reason. Musicianship seems solid though. Work on trying to tie together the theme of the song more.

aVThe theme video goes up at or around 20:00 UTC, then a countdown timer starts and you're supposed to compose, record &amp;c. in that two hours (and then upload).  As far as actually doing it in two hours, yes it's an honor system.  I mean, really, the only person you'd be cheating is yourself.  \u000a\u000aI usually use the first hour to write and record the rhythm guitars, bass, drums then spend the next 45 minutes writing and recording lyrics and then spend the last fifteen on a solo and mix-down.  I suppose what I'm finished with ends up being more punk than metal.
p4635

VProcessing on the clean vocals is nice, (maybe a little too much at some points, but it's your sound) the screams seem a little... unpolished, like all the effort went into the cleans and you just didn't bother with the harsher parts, so you may wish to do something about that.  \u000a\u000aInstrumentally, I can tell the bass was doing a lot of cool stuff, but I couldn't hear it very well most of the time, so maybe bring it up a bit.\u000a\u000aCinematically, I think the key to good presentation is energy, which was a little lacking.  On the other hand, I've never made one of these before, so maybe I don't know.  It is a pretty cool song though, I'd be interested in hearing more.
p4642
aVThis is pretty cool stuff. The bass is a little light in the mix. \u000a\u000aYour vocalist might benefit from more close-ups on the face, as the shots of her from farther away detract from the energy in the video IMO. At that distance, with the shot only taking up a quarter of the viewable area, it just gives the video a weird vibe of sorts.\u000a\u000aThat said, the music is quite good, I dig it!

aVDude, your guitarist has an awesome Carvin!\u000a\u000aAbout the video, I found it really awkward when she was standing there looking down while screaming. I think she lacked a lot of energy that really didn't fit the more extreme parts of the song. I also feel like the screaming vocals could've used a bit more processing to bring them out in the mix.\u000a\u000aCool and unique songwriting though, thanks for sharing!

V10-52 D'Addarios. They feel a lot better to me than EBs, they're inexpensive, and they last a long time.
p4675
aVI use 10-52 GHS boomers. I like em, but that's just, like, my opinion man.  
p4676
aVYou have good taste in strings.
p4677
aVThank you kind sir. I honestly started using them long ago during a Zakk Wylde phase I went through and they just stuck. 
p4678
aVD'Addario for life
p4679
aVI've been using them exclusively since I was about 19. Nothing else touches my babies.
p4680
aVI usually stick with the cobalt 'Not Even Slinky'. It has the lowest gauge of the 6 string packs, which i prefer in my guitars for high tension, regardless of tuning. It might just be me bullshitting, but i use cobalt because it doesn't have that crisp high end ring you get from picking. Could be from the strings' lacking of the polished finish, similar to how cymbals sound different depending on how they were finished; but again, I could be talking out my ass right now.\u000a\u000aYou can also try mix and matching different packs if you can spend the money and don't mind having strings sitting around. I once used the lower gauge of the 7string pack with another heavy gauge set just to see if my guitar could comfortably go down to drop A, which worked fine. However at that point i was pretty much stuck at tuning below D standard to reduce strain on the neck, so keep that in mind if you like to move your tuning around.
p4681
aVDoesn't sound like bullshit, I thought the cobalts had different tone too.\u000a\u000aSimilar to you I found there was less in the higher frequencies.  I didn't like them though because they sounded a little too dead to me.
p4682
aVThose cobalts sound cool but they oxidize so much faster. You're going to run into a lot of rust
p4683
aVD'Addario Jazz Light pro-steels. Those things are amazing and have great tension. I can go baritone on my 25.5" strat easily, so Drop C shouldn't be a problem. Personally I just play it in D#

aVI just got d'addario 10's with a wound g and they're excellent. It knocked out all the intonation and tuning problems I've been having on the g string and I didn't even get it set up. I also love Dunlop strings and they're cheap as fuck

asVScreaming vocalist looking for mic advice?
p4690
(lp4691
VIf you're looking for live, get a 58... if studio, SM7B
p4692
aVI would suggest saving up until you can afford something nice. My go-to mic for screaming vocals is always a Shure SM7b. Most metal records within the past 10 or so years have utilized this mic. One great example is Between The Buried And Me. It is pretty expensive new, but look for one used to save a couple bucks. These things (like Mose of Shure's lineup) are built like tanks so you won't be sacrificing quality going used. 
p4693
aVLook at your local pawn shops, I got a SM58 for 50$ and it hasn't failed me yet. I can link some test clips for you to hear it, I dont use VSTs on clips so they are all raw.
p4694
aVThat'd be cool. I won't be able to hear them till later though. \u000a\u000aI normally don't trust pawn shops when it comes to instruments, usually.

p4697
aVI just picked up a standard mic cable. 
p4698
aVI've had my Shure SM58 for seven years now and it has taken some beating along the way but still works without any problems. It's around a 100 bucks though, but it has paid itself back already.
p4699
aVIf I had the money, I definitely would go for it. If I can find it cheaper, I'll try for it.  \u000a\u000aAlso, do mics normally come with cords anyway or always separate? 
p4700
aVWell I bought [a set from Thomann](http://www.thomann.de/gb/shure_sm58_set.htm) that comes with a stand and cord, and if you look at the price of the set and the mic alone, it's smarter to just buy the set.\u000a\u000aBut normally they don't come with a cord.
p4701
aVShure SM57 or 58. 
p4702
aVSave for a 58, you won't need to buy another mic for years. If you scrimp on a mic and pay half of what you pay for a 58, you'll have to buy another one and it will die as well before the 58 would have.\u000a\u000aBesides being rough on the mic due to the environment it's in, a cheap mic won't hold up to screaming. Neither will a a good speaking mic. I blew up the diaphragm of my school's Bose mic with only 2 rehearsals for the Battle of the Bands 1997. \u000a\u000aI use a 58a Beta. All of my kids have played with it or slobbered on it as babies. I just give the sock a wash. They drop it, I drop it, and the cage is still in perfect shape.

aVIf there are any noise/psych bassists out there, I'd be curious to know what effects you use to generate lots of overtones.  I go with DI/Distortion &gt; chorus &gt; envelope filter &gt; phaser &gt; delay straight into the amp, no effects loop.  I'm still relatively new to noise, but I'm interested in the most effective way to create lots of stacked up overtones.

asVi don't like my misha mansoor OD. what's a good TS- OD i can put my money towards?
p4713
(lp4714
VMy personal favorite is the Maxon ST9+ Supertube. Its very similar to the Maxon OD808 (Which is great too) but has 18V operation, True Bypass, Low Boost, and a Mid Enhancement knob. Rob Barret from Cannibal Corpse boosts his Rectifiers with the ST9 and its also the one I use. It is quite pricey at 200 dollars though. If you don't want to drop quite that much money, the classic Ibanez tubescreamers or the Maxon OD808 are fantastic too.
p4715
aVI use pretty much any old tube screamer / over drive for the desired tone.\u000a\u000aI have a Joyo Classic Overdrive that works just fine at home. A MXR Classic Overdrive that I use on my live rig. In the studio locker I've got TS-9, TS-808, Maxon 808, ect.\u000a\u000aThey all kinda do the same thing. I chose the MXR for the live rig over the TS's and the Maxon due to the amp that I'm using (Mark IV). It just suited my tone better. If I was going to switch back to running my old 5150's the Maxon or the TS-808 would be back for sure cause those sound the best to my ears. If I was going to break out the old JCM800 and take that out, the TS-9 all day. \u000a\u000aIt's personal preference but you don't have to spend $200 on an overdrive that your basically just going to be using as a clean boost. 
p4716
aVI recently built a [GGG Tubescreamer](http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/effects-projects/distortion/tube-screamer/) with the "Very Expensive Boutique mods". Its supposed to be the same as a Landgraff Dynamic Overdrive. I have been pretty happy with this so far. If you are OK with a soldering iron, i would recommend this.\u000a\u000aBefore i decided to just build what i wanted, i was also looking at the Voodoo Lab Sparkle Drive Mod. I think that's worth a look too.

(lp4720
VSM57 is a dynamic mic... do you mean invest in a condenser?... I recommend a [RODE NT1-A](http://www.rodemic.com/mics/nt1-a) as a good but not mega expensive mic for acoustic guitar and vocals.  The acoustic tone in this track is not bad though... has a nice dark quality to it that suits the track.  \u000a\u000aThe track kicks ass!  Great riffs... love the tremelo picking and blast beats in particular.  Guitars are pretty tight (in most places) and the tone is good.  The bass tone is not so good... I don't think it compliments the guitars very well... there is a low 'honking' sound in there somewhere that is fighting the guitars for attention... you could fix that with EQ but I would start from scratch and record one track of clean/slightly dirty bass and one track of fuzzed out bass and blend/EQ/compress from there.\u000a\u000aThe drums sound very Toontrack-ish...  I highly recommend multisampling the kick, snare, and toms... it will help stop your drums sounding like every other Toontrack user (assuming that is what you are using)...  I tend to go for three of each... for example, a sub kick, a mid kick, and a clicky kick.  This will make your drums sound super fat (to match the chunky guitar tone) and will reduce the need for heavy compression.
p4721
aVHaha, yeah, that's what I meant, I hear condenser mics are amazing for acoustics.\u000a\u000aThat's great advice on the bass! I totally agree with you, that's my weakest link of my signal chain right now. Sounds like farts instead of having that good growl and it's annoying the hell out of me. I'm just using my Pod HD for my bass tone, do you think I should just go DI and use the tips you provided? I'll also look at getting a better set of strings for my bass to help prevent that honking sound you described.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, Toontrack indeed, haha. The Metalheads EZX for EZDrummer, specifically. That's a really interesting method that I've never considered, I'll definitely try that out with my DFH EZX and the stock kit.\u000a\u000aAgain, great constructive advice, I'll
p4722
aVI would use the POD for your bass... does it have bass amps on it?  Been so long since I've used Line6.  You could always record additional tracks with the DI if you wanted to for whatever reason... but I find that DI bass with plugins instead of amps tend to be too weak for metal.
p4723
aVUnfortunately Line 6 really screwed over bass users for the Pod HD and there's only one bass amp in the entire thing, the "Flip Top" that's based on the Ampeg B-15NF Portaflex. I'll try messing around with that more, I'm currently using a different model.
p4724
aVI messed around with making a new bass patch for the Pod HD and came up with this, does it sound better to you? https://soundcloud.com/guerillagorillas/new-bass-tone-comparison
p4725
aVYeah it sits under the guitar much better now!  Since the bass now has that nice scoop to make room for the guitar, it seems like it has taken a slight dip in volume... maybe try some parallel compression or multitracking to beef it up.
p4726
aVAwesome! I now notice that dip in volume as well, I'll definitely try doing some parallel compression. I've never tried it before but there's no better time to learn it than now.

asVLooking for a cab with a lot of GIRTH
p4735
(lp4736
VIf you're looking for girth and stoner-doom sounds, bass cabs are a great option.\u000a\u000aA 2x15 or a 4x10 would do nicely for live stuff. You could probably find 1 or 2 decent Sunn cabs for around that price. Just make sure you can match the impedance. A lot of bass cabs are 2 or 4 ohm input, which can be hard for a guitar amp to do.\u000a\u000a
p4737
aVI've actually really wanted to use a bass cab because I also play bass and having one for both would be great financially and space wise.
p4738
aVMake sure you get one without a tweeter or a tweeter that can be turned off, you don't want heavy distortion going through one of those, it'll sound fizzy and crap.
p4739
aVI got an Ashdown 2x10 for the same reason, paired it with my Peavey VK100. And I play Stoner/doom primarily, but I have a fuzz pedal that adds a lot of balls to my low-end. 
p4740
aVYou could potentially find a second hand Orange cabinet in that price range, they have really solid construction which I believe gives them quite a thick tone. As you probably know, loads of stoner and doom bands use them. 
p4741
aVA 1960 is a great cab.  5150s do fine on them.
p4742
aV1960A is a good cab. I have a custom ported 1x15 cab with a 200W Jensen Electric speaker in it... it's really great for sludgey metal tones. It's bassier than my Mesa 4x12 (not as tight though, since it's ported) and it's loud as fuck. Might want to check into something like that. I paid $600 for it new from a local guy who builds custom cabinets.
p4743
aVsweet. My grandfather has a wood shop and I've wanted to look into building a cab of some kind (when I played bass in a band it was going to be a 215)
p4744
aVDo it up. Could be a good learning experience. Mine is made out of cedar. Slightly odd but I already have like five other cabs so I just wanted to try something totally fucking weird for shits and giggles. (hence ported cab and 15" 200W speaker)

aVI think something like that would at just what I'm looking for to add on.  I cant remember the brand but there was a cab that had 2 12s and a 15, seemed awesome but could not find any sound samples..\u000a\u000aedit: randall xl125

aVI would KILL for a vader, I was so upset to hear they closed down. I will definitely look into that
p4749
aVI ordered a unloaded 2x12 even though  I don't need one right now but know it may be my only chance.
p4750
aVRemember as well, there's more than just the cab as a whole. It's the speakers working in conjunction with the wood that the enclosure is built from. If all else fails then change out 2 of the speakers for something that has a bit more of a low end response. I'd start with the celestion gt-75s. The 1960 is a solid cab though. Try running it at 4 ohms if you can.
p4751
aVYeah, I was thinking of doing gt-75s and V30s in an X pattern later.  Why 4 ohms? I know about matching impedance between the head and cab, but why would one be inherently better? 
p4752
aVI've played a lot of 1960 cabs at 4 ohms and they for some reason just sound a little thicker, granted this takes into effect if they want you to go that low. I've found that there is a slight sonic difference between 4 and 8 ohms. The low end sounds bigger and the high end is a little more "glassy" However there are a few 1960 cabs that want you to run at 8 ohms. The v30s are a great match too for the gt-75s are well. This creates a nice blend for playing live as well as recording. However, when you are recording, start by micing the V30 first. It wont have as much high or low end but that's ok because the mic and the placement will help determine the sound you want at that point.

aVI can do the gritty voice normally. I had a cold and sore throat a few weeks ago and haven't been able to do it properly since which is pissing me off. Hopefully my voice will fully recover and I can do these vocals again. And yes there is a Bass there.

aVNo worries then. Have you tried seeing a doctor? After two weeks it seems like something isn't right.

asVNeed some serious help with guitar effects and live tone.
p4799
(lp4800
VYou need a noise gate that uses the signal coming from your guitar to decide when to open and close but chokes the signal somewhere else in the chain.\u000a\u000aI *think* you can do this with both the Boss NS-2 and the MXR Noise Clamp.\u000a\u000aIt sounds like you're after a pedal switcher of some sort, something like [this from Voodoo Labs](http://www.voodoolab.com/switcher.htm).
p4801
aVPersonally I swear by multi-effects boards. One press on a pedal and you can change as many sounds and effects as you like. I have to use a complicated pedal arrangement in order to make use of the amp's distortion but it's worthwhile.
p4802
aVI'd try adjusting the tone controls on your amp before buying a lot more gear. Try rolling off the presence and/or highs, and turning up the mids a tad.\u000a\u000aA good OD will go a long way for that solo boost (and "clean" tone).\u000a\u000aWhat kind of amp do you have? It also might be time to replace some tubes...
p4803
aVThanks guys, very helpful so far. I'm playing through a Peavey 6505+. I've been able to correct some of my issues with the tone controls. I know how to get a good sound out of it, sure. But to eliminate feedback I've always had to reduce the volume or gain - not great for the sound I'm going for, but fairly adequate for live situations. At this point I'm planning on borrowing some pedals from a friend and just trying some things out to see what I can figure out on my own. If I have to turn off the noise suppressor in order to play a clean section, so be it. \u000a\u000aI've always been more interested in the playing side of things than the gear, but it's catching up with me as my standards are becoming higher. Why sound just passable when you could sound unforgettable?
p4804
aVI've noticed that when playing live, my guitar really sounds better when you dial down the gain - that way you can have a lot punchier sound when the amp is cranked up. Tube amps work really well this way.\u000a\u000aYou should also discuss about the problem with your bass player. Maybe you can together figure out how to make your overall sound better. But mainly, turn the distortion down. Hopefully this helps!

VLiking the mathcore feel going on, don't see too much of it around here. As for feedback, the riffs and song construction are pretty good other than the part that start at 0:40, I feel like riffs of this style have been done to death and are better avoided, especially when you can clearly write much better parts, as evidenced by the rest of the song. Overall though its pretty sweet. I especially like the wierd rhythm part at 1:36. Good mix and good song.
p4821
asVVocalist needed.
p4822
(lp4823
VYou're going about this completely ass-backwards in my opinion.  Vocals come after the music is written.  Sometimes the riff can set a certain mood and inspire some lyrics.  Also, having the riff/beat down already will allow the vocalist to know how to fit the vocals over the music rhythmically.  Try writing/recording the song and putting a demo up here so someone can have an idea of what to do with it.

p4848
(lp4849
VNot bad! I mean, it's pretty standard death metal. Nothing groundbreaking, but good nonetheless.
p4850
aVI quite like it. IMO, your tone is a little treble and gain heavy, but still pretty good. You could use a little EQ and compression on the kick drum to make it 'pop' a bit more - it's kind of buried in the mix. But very good death metal. Keep up the good work!
p4851
aVIt's pretty good. I don't adore your voice, how are you doing those drums? They sound pretty good.
p4852
aVhey thank you. Its a program called EZ drummer and I export through reaper
p4853
aVNot bad at all, the drums need to to be processed a bit better though, they definitely need to be a bit a more prominent. Good job though!
p4854
aVYou need to compress and limit vocals more and balance them in the mix with reverb and delay to help give the mix space.
p4855
aVcompress. gotcha, you're the second person to tell me that. Thank you!
p4856
aVContent wise, I'm digging it!  You could just use some work tightening up the production quality.  Make the drums pump a little more, and add some compression and EQ to the guitars and vocals.  Watching some YouTube videos on mixing, VST effects and bussing.  Nice job on the art work too!

p4864
aVSure! \u000a\u000aI plug my guitar into a Livewire SPDI Passive DI Box to split the signals: one going to the amp, and one going straight into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 USB Interface where I record the two signals, the wet/amp signal and the dry signal. That's all I have in regards to hardware. As for the gear I used in this recording, specifically, I used an LTD AX-50 plugged into an iPad 2 with a Line 6 Mobile In Guitar Interface running Positive Grid JamUP Pro.\u000a\u000aFor software in terms of mixing, I use Cakewalk SONAR LE for my DAW, which limits me to 30 tracks, 25 effects, and 8 buses. For drums, I use Toontrack EZDrummer with the Metal Machine EZX. As for plugins, I use stuff from SONAR, some of the Ignite Amps plugins (TSB-1, NadIR, SHB-1), some from TSE (BOD v2.0, X30), some Focusrite Scarlett plugins, and Waves OneKnob Louder if I need it. For mastering, I use Acoustica Mixcraft 5 and I use the Acoustica Compressor, the Classic Master Limiter, and Waves OneKnob Louder.\u000a\u000aHope this helps!

asVHow do vocalists like John Gallagher and Muhammad Suiçmez hit those low guttural growls?
p4886
(lp4887
VA lot of it has to do with how you shape the sound with your mouth. The way you hold your jaw, tongue, lips, and soft palate combined with the amount of support from your diaphragm will allow you to change your sound. The easiest way to get an idea of all this is to practice your vowels (a e i o u). As each sound forms naturally in your mouth, try to hold that shape as you say other words. For example, I tend to go with an "o" shape for my standard growls, an "i" shape for my higher screams, and an "e" shape for the gutterals.
p4888
aVfor me, its all about sticking out the lower jaw as much as possible, making a small hole with my mouth, and putting my tongue on various parts of the roof of my mouth. \u000a\u000ayour tongue position combined with the mouth shape causes your voice to sort of echo inside and make the growls sound deeper.\u000a\u000a\u000aof course i already have a very deep voice, and i cannot do highs like some of my favorite vocalists can. \u000a\u000a\u000anow that i think about it some more, ive found different positioning of my head also alters the sound quite a bit. chest out, chin basically on my chest and ive got the lowest i can go.\u000a

p4898
(lp4899
VI personally didn't care for the intro, I don't feel that it rolled into the song very well and the tone was really off. \u000a\u000aAlso I didn't like the way the guitar faded around the 4 min mark. Just held to long and the fade doesn't really compliment the rest of the song. \u000a\u000aAlso It's kinda a tad on the repetitive side, I think it'd work a lot better if it was just short and sweet. Still it's something to be proud of fore sure. I'd personally just change a few little things around. \u000a\u000aHave a good day and keep up the good work. 
p4900
aVThanks for listening man! I'm glad you said something about holding that note for too long, because I was thinking the same. I'll definitely look into that. 
p4901
aVI like it. A lot. A lot of it reminds me of Dethklok in the best way possible. The layered epic melodies really have that trademark Brendon Small feel. \u000a\u000aI do, however, think that the drums may be a bit loud, and I don't really hear a bass at all.
p4902
aVThanks for listening! I adore Brendon Small. He's guitar idol #2 for me. I love the way he composes music more than his actual skill. He's definitely the biggest influence on my current, and even next project. \u000a\u000aYou couldn't hear the bass because there was no bass. Lol. I don't have a bass (though I'm trying to change that), and so I'm kind of stuck. Also need a vocalist. But, in the meantime, I'm laying down all the guitar work. 
p4903
aVI can do both of those if you ever need tracks that aren't necessarily done in person.

aVCool beans man. If you have Dropbox, pm me your email. 
p4911
aVWow this reminds me so much of the music I used to write back in the day.  Good stuff... you are on the path to awesomeness.  I suggest that you (and the drummer) do a bit of research on ways to avoid cyclical traps... repeating a riff 4 times then moving on to the next one... you want fills on all instruments and variations on the riffs to play against listener expectations.  I also recommend changing your tag from thrash to melodic death and getting a grunty beast of a vocalist... no -core vocals... you want earth shaking roars... not castration screams!\u000a\u000aI like it.  Do more.
p4912
aVThanks for listening man. I am so torn between thrash and melodeath that I just call my music Melodic Thrash Metal for now. Lol. A lot of my earlier stuff was more thrashy, but this stuff (and even my next project) greatly resembles both. I'll figure it out as I go, though. \u000a\u000aI agree with you about the transitions. That's my weak point. This was the first project me and my drummer ever did together, so for the next stuff we should have even better chemistry. \u000a\u000aI had been greatly trying to figure out what kind of vocalist I needed. If you think a hard roarer is the way to go, I can see about that.

p4946
asVSome basic recording questions
p4947
(lp4948
VThe answers to these questions lie with you, I think! Experiment to see what sounds best for your music. I've heard songs where they do a lot more than double tracking. Sometimes you hear upwards of eight tracks split over both sides. \u000a\u000aIn regards to the harmonized rhythms thing, I think it's pretty common to do what you described (two tracks either side, one for each harmonized part). If you wanted to, you could quad track, and have each part represented twice on both sides. That might sound pretty cool.\u000a\u000aFor leads, a single track center is common. If it's a harmonized lead, I would definitely have each part panned. I like the "dueling guitarists" sound, but that's just me. Make sure in this case that you do something different with the rhythm part, as the hard left and right areas of your recording could get kind of crowded. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p4949
aVMy approach is to have 5 guitar tracks (possibly more if clean and other effects are introduced, but I treat those as extras). Two are rhythm tracks, panned hard left and hard right. Two are lead tracks panned about 50% left and right (so they don't occupy the rhythm guitars sonic space). And the last one is a centralized lead (solo) guitar. \u000a\u000aWhen I want harmonized rhythms, I typically just have them panned and shove them on their individual hard panned tracks. If I have a harmonized lead, I use the two 50% panned lead tracks. If I have a single lead, I will either use the two tracks and double track it (this is useful when you are going to introduce harmonies later, then you don't have to change tracks and dramatically alter the volume/sound) or put it on the solo track. \u000a\u000aThis covers 99% of all recording situations for heavy guitars. Unless you really want harmonized rhythm guitars equally in each ear (which you would probably have to quad track), this works basically all the time. Clean and other sounds I tend to do more on an individual basis.
p4950
aVYngwie's harmonies are always panned. Now it's pretty much the law when it comes to intricate harmonized lead lines.

aVI like using "experimental" for genres that stick the tip in a lot of genres without going balls deep in any two. \u000a\u000aIt's solid, man. No overchugging, no breakdowns, the song was consistently good throughout, leveling and mixing was well executed, each instrument was represented evenly... It's excellent!

aVHaha thank you, your comment made my day! :D

aVI heard a breakdown
p4974
aVIt was closer to a bridge.  It lasted for two measures, then continued with the C guitar coming in to support. 
p4975
aVThere was actually the intro lead over that 2 measure "bridge/breakdown" part, but I never got around to reamping it again, but I thought it sounded good without it so we went with just rhythm there

p5001

aVSeems too easy to read for a metal band logo. You've got to put one word under the other and write it in some crazy looking almost-illegible way. I'm only half joking\u000a\u000aThat said 1-3 are my favorites of what you've got there
p5009
aV[Ours is pretty minimalist](https://poisonedbylife.bandcamp.com/album/the-end), but it's doom metal, so that's kinda the point. It looks classy but menacing. Of yours, I like 4 and 7. 4 probably more fitting for something heavy. 7 is really creative and I think you should go with if you're in trad/doom or stoner metal band.
p5010
aVYes, yours works very well. I think the big problem I'm having is that we sound like [this](https://soundcloud.com/lucifers-stepdad/sets/lucifers-stepdad-ep) and that's halfway between readable logo and just looking like some sticks. Mild identity crisis.
p5011
aVWell, think about it. Does your band to you sound like "a bunch of sticks" to you? Or is it more streamlined like a 1970's Plymouth Barracuda with a Pentastar engine? Is it egregiously messy? Is it slender and vile? Is it edgy and sharp, curvy and voluptuous, quaint and unconfident? That should help you decide what sort of logo to make.

sVStereo recording/double tracking question
p5021
(lp5022
VIt depends on what your intentions are. Double and quad tracking guitars is usually to get the benefit of two things, one a wider image, two, a bigger/thicker sound. \u000a\u000aYou can get one by using different microphone and panning techniques. Two requires double or quad tracking your guitars because that benefit is really the bi-product of the slight differences in each take of the same part. Double and quad tracking also makes for a bigger overall stereo image as well so it kind of does both at once.\u000a\u000aI personally quad track all of my heavy rhythm guitars and double track the majority of my leads. I like it thick.  
p5023
aVI discovered that one guitar part recorded twice makes one stereo guitar part in the center. I would still think you would have to record twice to double-track because the unique nuances of each clash to make a larger sound, whereas if you use two mics on one take and pan hard stereo you would end up with one in the center.
p5024
aVIt will be a wider double track.  You will now be in the world of phase comb filtering.  There are alignment techniques but they never/rarely work better than refined mic placement.   You might want to have the 2020 further away from the cab like 3-4 feet back to give you room/bloom of the cabinet.  Then see if you like the performances grouped or the mics panned.  Think VH I close mic on one side and then the reverb/room sound on the other.  Different amp settings or guitars will give an even wider image.  Quad tracking is its own animal and it relies heavily on the tightness of performances.
p5025
aVThanks for the reply!! \u000a\u000aSo if im using 2 mics, assuming they are in phase &amp; panned and i want to double track, should i be created mono channels or stereo channels??\u000a\u000aMy thought was that a stereo channel hard panned left would not sound the one of the mics, and vise versa - am i wrong on that?
p5026
aVI would keep each mic mono so you can mess with panning separately.
p5027
aVStereo channel panning affects both channels so if you pan a stereo channel hard 100% to the left, it's equivalent to mixing both those down channels into a mono signal and sending them out the same speaker. The reason it's not actually a mono signal is because you still have 2 channels running, (one per mic), it just happens that you are sending them down the same side. \u000a\u000aWith 2 mics you either record one stereo channel or two mono channels. Either way is mostly the same except that you will have two tracks in your DAW with mono. 
p5028
aVThanks for hellpoing to clear this up for me, SO if i pan a stereo channel hard to the left, i wont be losing a mic, rather my DAW (cubase) will send BOTH mic signals to the left speaker? that helps a lot, thanks!!
p5029
aVCorrect. Stereo channels are always 2 signals, that's what stereo means. Panning merely affects how the DAW actually sends the signals to the speakers. Hard left means both are going 100% into the left speaker.\u000a\u000aCubase can also do a stereo channel where the individual signals within the channel can be panned (basically the same as having two mono channels, but controllable as a single channel), rather than having a single pan for the entire stereo channel. In this way, you can basically do stuff like (in your example) have the SM57 as hard left 100%, and the AT2020 as only 75% left. This means that the AT2020 will end up coming out of the right speaker a little bit. Or you can do stuff like SM57 40% left and AT2020 40% right, so that the stereo image is narrowly focused into the centre. The default mode for stereo is one signal is 100% left and one signal is 100% right, which is the widest stereo image you can achieve.\u000a\u000aThe only way you would ever lose a mic is if you muted it, basically.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind, with two mics, you want to pay attention to phase relationships (wave interference caused by the physical difference in distance between the two mics.) In a nut shell, if one mic receives the sound from your amp after 3ms, and the other mic receives the sound from your amp after 5ms, there is a 2ms difference between the mics. This will cause destructive interference which is, in most cases, not a good thing. Try to line your mics up so they are the same distance from the amp. Don't be afraid to use a tape measure for this, I do it all the time.\u000a\u000aNote, you can actually 'tune' your two mics, by setting them physically apart by very, very specific distances, to notch out specific frequencies but I think that may be a bit advanced for now. 
p5030
aVThanks very much for that info! I'm practicing all the right stuff so i think i may just have to get better at achieving an even mix in general - making sure instruments own their frequency range, etc - and maybe turning up a little louder \u005c\u005c../ &gt;&lt; \u005c\u005c../
p5031
aVYou can literally hitpoint detect one guitar part, line it up to the other, and it will still sound different (and better IMO) than 2 mics on the same performance.  Not to detract what you get from 2 mics, but don't mix them in stereo expecting what you get from good double-tracked guitar.
p5032
aVFor a more realistic sound, I'd prefer to record the tracks separately and also chance the EQ a bit between takes so things don't bleed too bad.

aVThere's a general lack of "air" or "brightness" to the mix compared to what I'm used to.  And the vocals are too loud, and probably not compressed enough.\u000a\u000aThe rhythm guitars sound good but need more presence.\u000a\u000aBass guitar?  I'm sure there's one there but I can't really tell besides the low end seeming to be more than a guitar can make.  You could grunge it up more, and take some low end from the guitars to help make it more in-the-mix.  \u000a\u000aIn fact, the whole mix sounds uncompressed.  The snare has no sense of room.\u000a\u000aThe lead guitar tone around 2:34 is gross.\u000a\u000aSinging is meh.  I'd either bury it in FX, autotune, or make him retake it.  He sounds bored.  More emotion!\u000a\u000aPerformance-wise it sounded good, besides the clean vox.  The problems I'm pointing out are me being picky.  The mix is really about 75%-80% there, the balance is mostly right but the lack of compression lets things get away.\u000a\u000a

asVOkay, seriously, how the fuck do I learn to play lead guitar?
p5070
(lp5071
Vi suggest learning existing solos that you like, doing this will make you learn the techniques and motifs that are present in the leads. then you can use them to influence your own leads.
p5072
aVI recommend investing in some type of looper pedal. Use it to practice leads over other riffs you have written. You know your scales, so you already have a great starting point. Now it's just a matter of experimentation. Best of luck!
p5073
aVThis. Sometimes I just throw a chord progression into a looper and then just play over it for an hour or two. It really helps.
p5074
aV[deleted]
p5075
aVExpertise: I've been playing lead guitar for about five years now. You can hear some of me and my bandmate Joe's solos on our bands record.  [\u005c[link\u005c]](https://amiensus.bandcamp.com)  I pride myself at being pretty damn good at improvisation too.\u000a\u000aHere's some tidbits I randomly wrote down to help you learn how to crank out some solos. \u000a\u000aIf you're going to practice this, I suggest doing so alone and in a forgiving manner. if you fuck up while practicing, you fuck up. Everyone does. You're going to. It's part of the grind, just refocus and move on. The worst thing you can do is get discouraged because then you will definitely fail. Calm your nerves and just play around. \u000a\u000aHippy poetry aside, my first suggestion would be to learn the pentatonic scale. This scale is powerful and your knowledge of it is actually probably already innately programmed into you. [\u005c[source\u005c]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6tB2KiZuk)\u000a\u000aAfter you get the pentatonic scale down, I suggest either googling/spotify "Blues Jam tracks" or just general jam tracks to just practice soloing with. Gradually mess around with just jamming over your favorite tunes. \u000a\u000aAnother great exercise involves not playing the guitar at all at least in real life. Listen to a song/jam track and simply create the tune in your head. Don't worry about what it would look like on the fretboard, just focus purely on melody and note/phrase choice. \u000a\u000aIf you wanna get fast, you gotta do those scale runs. I suggest using a speed trainer in a program like Tuxguitar or GuitarPro. Go from 1/4th bpm up to full bpm and even to 1.5bpm to master whatever lick you want in a clean fashion.\u000a\u000aVibrato is really important. It took me forever to realize this. A distorted guitar lead without it sounds amateur. (depending)\u000a\u000aThis is at least how I got to where I am, of which I am pretty happy. Best of luck dude!
p5076
aVOne exercise I do for vibrato is to pick a note just once and then\u000atry to sustain it for a long time (you can go by seconds, or count the\u000anumber of "wobbles").   Shoot for 8-10 vibrato cycles for each\u000atime you pick and your playing will be singing in no time.  
p5077
aVI usually use Electric Funeral by Black Sabbath to practice vibrato.  The main riffs use a ton of vibrato, underneath the wah, and they sound dead and boring if you don't use any.  Plus, the main riffs are all on the 1st-3rd frets, making the strings harder to bend, which builds up finger strength. 
p5078
aVI'm not sure what genre of music you write for but the way I usually approach solos is by writing some sort of melody that goes along with whatever chords are being played.\u000aHow do you decide what is a good melody to play?\u000aSince you say you have writing experience treat it as you would the notes for lead vocals. Make it 'singable', then after you have a good basic melody down, add some flair. Fast runs down the right scale or arpeggio of a chord in the place of a few nets can be very effective; that being said every song is unique so don't overdo it!\u000a
p5079
aVIt helps to have a good feel of the guitar. As rhythm players, we have a good understanding of where to place our fingers on the first 7 frets. But higher on the neck and we tend to feel less comfortable.\u000a\u000aOne thing I often do to familiarize myself with the neck is to get on YouTube and search for backing tracks (usually jazz in Em) and play clean solos over them. I don't worry about adhering to certain scales or patterns, I just play in key and get a feel for the song. Playing clean also helps you hear the notes you're truly playing instead of masking minor mistakes in distortion. 
p5080
aVScales, lots of them.  Start of slow, build accuracy and after you've got that start building up that speed.  Learn them well, and learn many variations of them.  The more you understand that the notes and the key in which you are playing the better you can write riffs.  The better you understand your riffs the better you can pick out the changes, the mood, the note progression.  If you understand that then you're on your way in to feeling those spots the solo fits over.\u000a\u000a  While your doing that, covers of songs you like.  Tell yourself "Right, this solo from this song I like, I'm going to learn that sumbitch!".  Tell yourself that then try and do it.  If you can't pick something that sounds easier in another and get to it, come back to that hard one later.  If you do nail the first solo you pick, make yourself learn another one that's harder.  Progress and always move forward to new and better things.\u000a\u000a  Hard work and theory, they're not dirty words. :)
p5081
aVLearning leads you already like by other bands is a good start. \u000a\u000aIn terms of *writing* leads though, I find it best to work in sort of a piecemeal fashion. Write a little piece at a time, and practice each section until you have them so solid you could play them while closing your eyes or watching TV or some such. \u000a\u000aJust doing a total improve over metal parts is, in my experience, not necessarily going to lead to something satisfactory, especially since leads in metal tend to be very fast, so that putting feeling and/or meaning behind the playing tends to become quite complex to achieve, and lots of players make metal solos that sound like masturbational fluff. \u000a\u000aGood luck!
p5082
aVYou need to learn everything you can about chords and hwo they are constructed before you can get into lead guitar. Remember, if you truly want to play something beautiful, don't try to solo over music. It's been done forever now and all it takes is memorizing a bunch of licks and scale.

aVYou know your modes?\u000a\u000aYou know your scales?\u000a\u000aYou know any solos?\u000a\u000aYou know how to play any songs 1000% the way through? \u000a\u000aBecause you need to be able to do all of this to even begin to approach writing a solo.\u000a\u000aA solo is a self-contained song within a song. A solo rips you from the song in a way that is relevant to prosody as well as relevant to the player / genre (meaning, 32nd note runs in reggae would be fucking weird). \u000a\u000aApproach it logically. Make a library of licks. Learn a new _song_ every day. If you can't manage an entire song, learn half of one. Or a quarter. Just keep adding to your expertise, it can only help you.

sVDoes my "strategy" for recording metal vocals seem viable? Tips are welcome.
p5091
(lp5092
VYes, that will work fine. 2 other things:\u000a\u000a 1. You'll need to do some work to get it to sound good in a mix. Heavy compression, some EQ, etc. I'm not sure whether you intend layering it over the existing vocal line - if so, maybe you don't really need to worry about how it fits and just make sure it's louder.\u000a 2. If you're doing this at home, you'll need to deaden the room so that the reverberations off the walls aren't audible in the mic. Hanging thick curtains or duvets over hard surfaces helps. Some people like to use something like a [Reflexion Filter](http://www.seelectronics.com/reflexion-filter-pro) attached to the mic stand to help with this, but a recent test in Sound on Sound magazine didn't show that they helped much at all.
p5093
aVDid some googling and the podfarm program should have EQ's and compressions, and for my own music i won't have an existing vocal track, but the covers i will, only slightly muted.\u000a\u000aI have the keys for this rehersal room intended for bands to play in, so that should be covered.\u000a\u000aThank you for the answer:)
p5094
aVI wouldnt necessarily sugget heavy compression right off the bat...compression should be lighter than heavier on vox imo, though i suppose it can depend on the dynamics of the vocal track. Otherwise OP could end up with really loud inhalation noises/nuances that dont lend themselves to the recording
p5095
aVAs a rule, I would just edit those bits out from the recording. If it doesn't sound good loud, you probably don't need it.
p5096
aVYeah not a bad m.o.. still though, you wouldnt just increase the track volume rather than squash it with a comp? 
p5097
aVFor me:\u000a\u000a 1. Cut out everything between vocal lines that I don't want;\u000a 2. Automate the level of individual words or phrases up or down if they are significantly too loud or quiet;\u000a 3. Smash it with a compressor to get everything consistent.\u000a\u000aI find vocal levels vary too much even within a single phrase for it to be as simple as just setting the track level high enough.
p5098
aVAh yeah. Certainly nothing wrong with that. To be fair ive never processed metal vocals, haha
p5099
aVAh, thank you, i will probably end up copying your strategy ;)
p5100
aVVocals are a no-brainer.  You could even get fairly decent vocal tracks just by using a smartphone microphone and a freeware recording program like Audacity.  \u000a\u000aYour set up is more than adequate - SM-58s are great and you wont need to upgrade for the forseeable future unless you are really going for an amazing studio setup.\u000a\u000aAs others said, after the fact you're definitely going to want to add some compression, reverb, and EQ after the fact.  Compression really really helps and will even out the "final" volume of the track.  You should also pay attention to the room you are recording in and how it effects reverb and other recording characteristics.  If you have trouble with 'popping' from making hard 'p' and 't' sounds, put a sock over the mic or use a proper pop filter.
p5101
aVAh and yeah, i have a pop filter added to the buy list too, i'v been thinking about getting the program "Reaper" for the compressions and such. Thanks
p5102
aVReaper is pretty good.  Good luck and post anything you do up here if you want any feedback.
p5103
aVThanks :) yeah i will, in a couple of weeks or so...
p5104
aVThat's pretty much the configuration I have been using for the last five years when I record at home. You'll be fine.\u000a\u000aExpect a few times of configuring and messing up with your interface/software(s).

aVI thought so, thank you :)
p5106
aVyour setup sounds great bruv. RE: sonar, I really enjoyed using it for the few months I did, but I still feel that cubase is my go to. everything works with little to no stress.

I will say that I found the interface and UI is very similar between them so that helps.\u000a\u000aI used protools for nearly a decade but I just prefer cubase for home studio recording. Good luck!

I think the 5% fee is quite high, although other sites such as GoFundMe have fees at 7.9%. (And then you end up also paying paypal fees).\u000a\u000a\u000aI had the luxury of being able to write the code myself to handle the payments.\u000a\u000a\u000aGood luck!
p5168
aVYour site looks super professional, nice job! 
p5169
aVJust so you know. The difference between EPs and LPs (albums) is a time based thing.\u000a\u000aTaken from the days when singles were REALLY hot shit, vinyl wise. An EP was basically a single with a couple of extra tunes. Usually about 15-20/25 minutes or so in length. \u000a\u000aIn regards to using Kickstarter. I've never used it although I reckon you will need a fair size support to really reap any benefit from it. \u000a\u000aWhat are your donation gifts going to be? So if someone donates $10 what will they get? If I donate $25 what will I get? etc
p5170
aVI'm still trying to come up with some affordable reward ideas. I'm thinking some 11"x17" hand-numbered posters or something might be cool for the $10 donors. If I can find an affordable screenprinting place then shirts might be nice for $25 donors. Perhaps name in album liner notes and a shirt for $50+ donations. 
p5171
aVI have mastered *several* albums that got kick-started, only for the bands to break up. Most of them, *right after* the "CD release party! come one come all! gonna be fun!!!!!!"\u000a\u000aOnly thing I would say, do not fucking break up. You promise a lot of stuff that will not get done, and people will hate you. Well, maybe not hate, but you don't want your friends to go every time "Hey, where's that lap dance you promised?" \u000a\u000a\u005cm/\u000a\u000a
p5172
aVWell I'm a one-man project so there's not really any breaking up to be done, I plan to continue making music for some time haha. 
p5173
aVGood! go ahead, the impulse of making art is something no one can stop. Hit me up for mastering when you're done! 
p5174
aVI will definitely keep you in mind!
p5175
aVhere is your issue, as a one man project you cannot play shows. You will need to hire musicians to play with you. Most of your money is made from shows.
p5176
aVI'm not necessarily looking to make money, I just want to get my music out there. Shows would be fun, but I'd have to learn to do vocals and play guitar at the same time, though. Could always go with the backing track thing if I really had to. 
p5177
aVthe key thing with singing and playing a the same time is you need to practice multitasking, you need ot get the guitar part down where you can do it while talking with someone or reading.
p5178
aVI guess I've got some practicing to do!
p5179
aVa good drill is to work on something easy. \u000a\u000aI used nothing else matters and finger picked it. Once that got done I worked on faster things. another good trick is whenever you are talking to someone on the phone, pick up your guitar unplugged and play the song.

aVis he opening? because if you are just playing everything through a backing track you really aren't much more than a DJ.
p5186
aVI write and record all my music. I play the synths/solos live as well as vocals. I've played over 100 live shows; some i've opened, some i've headlined, some i've been in the middle. I stand toe to toe with every full band I gig with.
p5187
aVOK i've checked some of it out its not bad but its definitely missing some punch dude. if you combined your songwriting with a full band you'd sound even better.\u000a
p5188
aVI don't mean to crush your dreams, but to be perfectly honest, if you don't have a lot of fans/supporters, you probably won't raise very much.\u000a\u000aI've been making music for over 7 years and have been playing shows for 5. I thought I had a decent amount of supporters, but when I did a kickstarter campaign recently for a music video and I only raised $400 on a goal of $2,000. It's great that I raised that much, but I couldn't deliver without reaching the goal.
p5189
aVI was planning on setting the goal only around $250, which I think would cover most of the needed studio time. I plan to rehearse a lot before going in so that I can lay down most of the tracks quickly. If I don't end up meeting the goal I will just have to save up before going into the studio.

BTW I'm not a vocalist.

I'd like to hear where you go from here, I started following you on Soundcloud! \u005cm/\u000a\u000aCriticisms\u000a\u000aThis is totally superficial as I haven't listened to everything thoroughly: I love the intro to Perdition but when the bass comes in it sounds a little off time on the second bar (I think!) just slightly. And the clean guitars almost melt into the distortion, it would be nice if the mix made room for the clean here with some EQ automation maybe.\u000a\u000aKeep rockin man!
p5205
aVFirst of all cheers for checking us out! I never really thought about the sepultura style in the music, can see what you mean at times.\u000a\u000aThanks for the feedback. We came into it thinking of it as demo so the playing is often far from perfect haha just wanted something we can use to start to get our name out there! As for the clean section i never really thought of it being quiet tbh, i guess once you listen to a song over and over again you start to get used to how everything sounds. If we re record it with real drums ill definitely take that into consideration.\u000a\u000aThanks again!
p5206
aVWow, it *is* heavy.\u000a\u000aI've listened to the first two and the last tracks. The first two tracks sounded a bit unmelodic, maybe because the few melodies are in the lower range of the guitar and it makes them less prominent. Perdition was much more melodic, especially the chorus. I like the overall sound, keep up the good work!\u000a\u000aedit: I've just listened to Nefarious, it's kinda post metal-ish, I love it!
p5207
aVThanks for taking the time to listen! I'm gonna take your surprise at it being heavy as a good thing? haha My writing style never really focus's too much on melody, usually just mess about with riffs and see what comes out to be honest. Hoping now we got a full band finally that the song writing process will become more of a band effort, rather than me by myself. Will probably see more leads/melody in future releases.\u000a\u000aI am definitely a fan of some post metal so there would have definitely been a post metal influence on Nefarious! Was the first track we collaborated on some 3 years ago when i would have been listening to a lot of it. Glad you liked it, its one of our favourites too! Unfortunately for our vocalist haha\u000a\u000aCheers again for the listen!

asVI want to start recording a demo project. Where do I start?
p5224
(lp5225
VIts gonna be pretty hard to record a demo with out buying any equipment but it a definitely possible, you'll need a DAW (digital audio workstation) anything from audacity to pro tools will work for you I'd recommend reaper.  For recording you'll use the interface so you won't have to buy any mics you'll need amp Sims for the guitars and bass.  For drums you'll need a program like ezdrummer or something similar.  For vocals you will have to invest in a decent microphone and interface to properly record that.  Most of these things you can get for free or on free trial for aome like reaper the full version will be around 50$ or so if you want some thing more ramped up it will cost more.  Lastly you could rey some live recording just get some friends who play instruments and jam with a live recording device or even record into a 8 track or something old school. 
p5226
aVOkay, thanks for the reply! So let's say I'm going to get Reaper, how exactly should I setup my gear to get the best possible quality and as little latency as possible? Should the interface go to my amp's headphones jack, and headphones/speakers to the interface's output? Also, what about these "amp sims", do they come with reaper or do I need to set them up somehow?
p5227
aVGood advice above, get Reaper and start recording your project there.\u000a\u000aIf what you've written is good, you can easily find people on reddit or other sites to throw in the other parts. If you're a bassist, stick to playing bass and find a guitarist/drummer/vocalist to finish it out.
p5228
aVYou're on the right track for a basic recording setup. A full home studio isn't needed for just laying some ideas down. This is my setup for recording in my room:\u000a\u000a* Peavy VIP-3 amp with USB interface (like what you have)\u000a* Desktop computer: quad core 2.6ghz processor, 8gb ram, on-board sound card (PCI cards are great too)\u000a* Ableton Live 8.1 for recording and adding drums/orchestral tracks\u000a* Boss NS-2 noise suppressor pedal (my room has a ton of electromagnetic interference, bad power wiring)\u000a\u000aYou do not need a software suite like Ableton to record though. I started with Audacity and it worked quite well. I switched to Ableton because it comes with a plethora of instruments that I am still learning how to work in to my music. [Beatcraft](http://www.acoustica.com/beatcraft/) served me well, but I got tired of having to export drum tracks and import them into whatever I'm recording my guitar with.\u000a\u000aSide note on your USB interface: You could very possibly encounter some ferocious hardware latency when recording. This becomes a big problem when your guitar tracks sound off-tempo because of the latency. I installed [ASIO4ALL](http://www.asio4all.com/) and now have MUCH less latency compared to MME/DirectX. Make sure to calibrate your software for hardware latency (Ableton has a built in guide) - I can elaborate if you need any help.\u000a\u000aEdit: [This](https://soundcloud.com/originalname/low-and-slow-bbm) is an example of the drums and orchestral instruments in Ableton being used a song idea I recently recorded. Might be a little loud, just a heads up.

asVWhat are some good pedals for metal.
p5230
(lp5231
VIt all depends on your budget and your current amp and whatnot. Personally, I REALLY dislike most of the pedals out there with "metal" in their name so I would avoid those (listen to anything off Omen by Soulfly, or Trivium's cover of Slave New World and then listen to the original one, there's a huge difference there).
p5232
aVlets say $50 on pedals 
p5233
aVI have the Digitech "Metalcore" pedal and it's really universal. It has low mid and high as well as level and gain knobs plus it has a mid frequency one and it was between 60-80 bucks and it's versatile as fuck. I use it for all my metal playing no matter what band or sound I'm trying to go for it is really awesome.
p5234
aVI own a Boss metal zone pedal, haven't used it in years. It's hard for me to get a smooth tone with it - always sounds really harsh no matter how I EQ it. That being said, if harsh is what you want, it is still a fairly flexible pedal. \u000a\u000aMy old Ibanez Smash Box was my favorite distortion pedal, but those seemed delicate - I went through two of them with normal use, the pedal's on/off switch would just stop working.\u000a\u000aEdit: These might retail for above your budget, but most Boss pedals (the ones that are solid metal) are built like tanks, so I'd have full confidence in buying one used to save some cash.
p5235
aVHM-2 for everything, no questions
p5236
aVTube screamer \u000a/thread 
p5237
aVIf you want a really tight sound that's on par with Periphery's style you'll usually start out with a compressor to give the playing more cut and to round out the top/bottom of the noise, a general noise-suppresor (ISP Decimator) to get the mud out, any tube screamer, another noise suppressor with a noise-gate in it for snappy silences (NS-2) and a delay (which I usually set to work basically like a chorus pedal without the wonkyness for a more full sound). I can't get myself to like  heavy distortion without refinement, even if it's not for technical metal. Clear beefiness. 
p5238
aVAs a new owner of a 6505+/mesa cab half stack this posts gets exactly to the pedals I might personally need. Thanks!
p5239
aVNot sure if there's a flair of mine saying I own exactly those 2 pieces (I'm on mobile) or just coincidence. They are rock solid. 
p5240
aVWow, pure coincidence. Don't see the flair.
p5241
aVBoss HM2s are pretty common.  There are a couple of different specs depending upon where they were built, and Lone Wolf Audio has a pedal (I think it's called the left hand wrath) that combines several of the most popular in one box.
p5242
aV&gt; Boss HM2s are pretty common.\u000a\u000aIn Sweden.\u000a\u000aIn the 90s.
p5243
aVHahaha, yup!
p5244
aVSome of their tones was simply a marshall tube amp being overdriven.  So an overdrive pedal will likely be your ticket.\u000a\u000aEspecially Slayer and Death.  Go to a guitar center, take the bc rich stealth chuck model and plug it into a marshall and you got his tone right away.
p5245
aVIf the amp being used is decent, you'll want to keep your signal chain simple. Ibanez Tube screamers (ts 9/808) are generally used to give a slight boost/crunch to the guitar signal to help drive the amp a little harder. They also do an excellent job of doing classic overdrive tones for blues and classic rock. Prices range from around $100 for newer/cheaper models, to around $300 for older/boutique/modded models. Other pedals to consider are noise gates (isp decimator) to reduce feedback noise/hiss, and a compressor for evening the signal.\u000a\u000aIf the amp isn't too hot, or lacks decent gain and drive, i would then look into distortion pedals. I have a Digitech Hardwire TL-2 that go for about $100, and i've been really satisfied with it. It features true bypass, high and low gain, mid gain and frequency sweep (something alot of cheaper distortion pedals lack), distortion gain, and a tight/loose switch for different distortion. It also looks pretty sexy and has a game changing blue LED light.\u000aI've heard some good things about Electro Harmonix's Metal muff as well as Blackstar's HT-Distortion (uses an actual tube) for classic metal, though i haven't tried them myself. I have, however given the MXR Fullbore a try, but preferred the TL-2 over it since i found the distortion not to my taste. It does feature a built in noise gate feature that is really nifty, so it's worth a thought.\u000a\u000aFinally, i would recommend against alot of gimmicky/cheap looking pedals. Specifically Digitech Death Metal, Metal Master, Grunge^why_did_i_buy_this , Boss's Metal Core, Metal Zone, and any shitty brands like Behringer. Their features and distortion are less than ideal, and are aimed at suckering beginners and uneducated with their low prices. The only exception would be if the pedal was modded (I believe Cannibal Corpse use a Keely Modded Boss Metal Zone), but at that point you're probably paying outside your budget. \u000a
p5246
aVI like the Electro-Harmonix Metal Muff.
p5247
aVGood distortion is a lot easier to get from the amp, maybe with a booster pedal (I use a DOD YJM distortion for a solo boost only), than with a distortion pedal. Every distortion pedal I've used into a clean amp I've hated the sound of. Honestly just have him get a cheap multi-pedal like the Digitech RP series and save up for either a nice amp or a nicer multi-pedal later on
p5248
aVHM2 for entombed/trendy hardcore infused stuff, anything else and amp distortion channels are probably your best bet
p5249
aVThe two that keep coming up here and that you will actually see everywhere else are the Boss HM-2 Distortion and the TS808 Tube Screamer. There are other good distortion pedals, and Boss seems to be pretty popular with metalheads (I've never owned anything besides an HM-2 but I hear good things about the DS series.) There are always lesser known brands making good stuff though. I own an Iron Horse by Walrus Audio, and it sounds as gnarly as an HM-2, but it's kinda like that blended with a doomy Electric Wizard or QOTSA fuzz. \u000a\u000al also have an MXR Carbon Copy for analogue delay. Not a metal specific pedal but it's a good thing to own in general. Same one High on Fire uses.

The brand of the hoodie itself is Tultex and I think the model is RN 104126.\u000a\u000aNot sure if any of that really helps, but if you're looking for quality, see if whatever place you go with has those hoodies and you won't be disappointed

p5261
aVThanks for another awesome post! Still trying to wrap my head around the whole fifths, minor sevenths, sixths, etc., but that's my fault for being a noob and not something you should have to cover in this series. \u000a\u000aThat said, do you have any resources that you can think of that explain all that in a digestible format? Alternatively, you've definitely got a penchant for explaining stuff so maybe you've got something that you've written on the subject before or feel motivated to whip up a quick little primer on it?
p5262
aVI'll try my hand at explaining intervals right now. Basically, intervals are referred to by numbers which indicate how many steps on a scale they are from the root. For example, a fifth chord (the basis of power chords) is five notes in a major or minor scale from the root. A "minor interval" is a half-step smaller than its major counterpart. For example, between a root and its major third, there are four half-steps. A minor third has only 3 half-steps.\u000a\u000aMost of the minor intervals appear in the minor scale, specifically the minor third, minor sixth, and minor seventh. The minor second appears in the Phrygian mode only, there is no such thing as a minor fourth, and a minor fifth is usually called a diminished fifth or a tritone.\u000a\u000aAlso important to note for practical use is that each interval has an inversion. This means that, if you play a note that is an interval *down* from the root (as opposed to up from the root), then you are playing that interval's inversion, which can be used to give a similar but not quite the same feel to a passage. For example, a fifth on the bass guitar (in standard) is two frets up on the next-higher string. A fourth is on the same fret, next-higher string. But on the same fret on the next-*lower* string, a fourth down, you will be playing the fifth, just lower.\u000a\u000aAs I said before, most of the intervals you'll find useful for metal are in the minor pentatonic scale. Play around with them some.
p5263
aVThanks! That helps. The relative location of the intervals definitely helps to explain why those things sounded right together even before I knew of their actual relationship.\u000a\u000aI feel like I'm on the precipice of understanding...but just trying to find that thing that makes it really "click" and actually make sense fully. Having memory problems makes it much more difficult to rely on rote memorization so I need to find that tipping point that makes it click and lets my brain think of it naturally without having to exactly remember the relationships but to feel them...if that makes any sense\u000a\u000aAnywho, thanks again and I look forward to your next post!
p5264
aVLearning the intervals is probably going to be more muscle memory, which I think is different neurologically from regular memory. But best of luck to you regardless.

VWell, the riffs are killer, and that tone is heavy as fuck. it needs better mixing, just don't make it sound generic as fuck. \u000a\u000aalso, you don't sound very well synced with your drums.
p5268
aVThanks for commenting! Agree it need better mixing (as it's not mixed at all).\u000aAppreciate the kind words on the riffs and tone, the tone took a while to get down. I have a earlier version of the track just before this one, up on Soundcloud. The difference between the tones is striking!\u000a\u000aThe sync can be entirely blamed on me; most of the time that I've recorded everything has been early mornings or late nights, so I'm not exactly in top conditions when I record. It may also be that I can have accidentaly moved some of the tracks off-sync, it's something I'll have to go through later today.
p5269
aVYeah, there's something off with the 2 guitar channels here. Could be latency issues on one or the other chain? otherwise it could be a nudged sample.\u000a\u000aIt could also just need more tightening up to get the parts to sit right.\u000a\u000aTone was nice, but there was too much guitar in the mix, and not enough drum.\u000a\u000aNice work dude!

Do what he says, don't dick around and they'll more often than not make you sound good. \u000a\u000aDon't go "Oh, I can't hear my guitar, better turn it up!" you might not be able to hear it but trust me, everyone else can and if you change that then you mess up his mix.\u000a\u000aEngage the audience. This might be more down to the vocalist (not sure what member you are). If you're playing more than one song, inbetween songs the singer should be the ONLY thing you hear.\u000a\u000aAfter every song have a quick run through your tuners.\u000a\u000aAct professional like you've done this a million times. But not in a dicky "Where is my water I asked for, servant?!" kind of way. But y'know, minding your Ps and Qs.\u000a\u000aNEVER play over your allotted time. You got 30 minutes?

aVVery helpful thanks! 
p5280
aVBotBs are 99.99999% of the time determined by crowd response, participation, and numbers. You have to hold the biggest, most entertained crowd during your set to even be looked at. They're not judging on anything that really has anything to do with your musicianship, and if they do, it's a negligible percent of your score. So basically, bring as MANY PEOPLE as you can, and tell them to go ape shit. As douchey as this sounds (especially if the prize is something worth a damn), you can ask them to leave after your set so they don't fluff up the crowd for other competitors. Some even go off pre sale ticket numbers alone, so if you aren't the top seller, your set doesn't even matter. A lot of douchebag "promotion" companies solicit these pre sale type shows for bands that aren't doing much on their own (it's borderline a scam). Just be weary. Don't make battles the only shows you book.
p5281
aVHoly shit thats heartbreaking. So many talented bands probably went unnoticed for this reason. Thats probably why shitty -core bands were being signed up by the dozens...
p5282
aVYa, it isn't like every cheesy band movie where the whole point of the movie is to prepare for this fantastic, dreamy battle of the bands. Then, upon winning, you sign a trillion dollar record contract and go on a headlining world tour immediately. But in reality, it does make goods business sense to fuck with bands that pull energetic, consistent crowds instead of the world's fastest band that bores normal folk. A lot of metal is doomed to be nothing more than musician's music, especially when you get into shit that has whacky tempo and signature changes for no good reason other than, "look, we can all stay in sync in eleventy/twelve timing." That's the thing, though; the first thing a band should decide is whether the music is for the fans, or for their own satisfaction.
p5283
aVThey key to getting big in the metal scene is to have super groovy music and to put as much energy into the crowd as you want out. My band is by absolutely no means big but we have music that is inviting to move to (16-30's love this) and put a decent stage show on. Maybe 5% of the population of my town listens to metal or anything that could be remotely considered metal, but people like us because we look like we are having fun and we make people want to move. I live in a small hick town where everyone is either a wangster or a hick who listens to country, I have seen some of the most thugged out as well as some of the most rednecked kids in the town, dead center of the pits. It is a really cool thing to see.
p5284
aVYa, I live in the same type of area. It's funny, I have a friend that is a straight beer drinking, overall wearing, truck driving hick, but listens to straight up fucking metal. He'll always go the hardest in the pit. I love seeing people like that, completely destroying their stereotypes.

aVHow is it being judged? Did you have to pre-sell tickets?\u000a\u000aIf it is based on crowd reaction then if you play last you have the best chance because most of the people at the end were to see you. Likewise if you play first then you have almost no chance to win.\u000a
p5288
aVNo pre-sale. It's just a simple battle of the bands but it could launch our name across the province (literally) and hopefully get more fans. \u000a
p5289

p5323
aVIt was indeed intentional, I think this is how metal is supposed to sound.
p5324
aVThose riffs are sick!\u000a\u000aI think you should mix the drums again so they don't sound like Superior Drummer.  Multisample the kick/snare/toms to get them sounding chunky and a little less like all the other Superior Drummer tracks out there!
p5325
aVThank you my friend!\u000a\u000aI actually used Toontrack EZdrummer with the Drumkit From Hell plugin along with Reaper.  I think they sound fine but I will take your advice into account for future recordings.  I have many riffs, probably several songs worth, that I did not use for this demo and I actually wrote more today.  There will be many more Treeweaver releases of this fashion in the future.\u000a\u000aWhat I do for the drums to give them a better feeling at the moment is to just add a little touch of reverb to them, it balances in the mix very well I think.
p5326
aVThat mock solo in Silencing Void Dweller is delicious filth.  Hope you're going to do more like that!  And I love the way you force the strings to go off pitch... are you doing that by pressing down really hard or something?\u000a\u000aI don't remember if EZdrummer lets you multisample... does it have the X-drums?
p5327
aVWell the soloing in that song is directly influenced by Trey Azagthoth's style, and it's totally based on being influenced by the feeling in the moment of playing it.  I didn't write those solos, I just sat down and hit record and went wild with it.  I do a lot of random hammer ons/pull offs and incredibly fast tapping in random bursts in cool patterns and stuff like that.  I can tell you that the end of the solo in Death Stares Back is just really hard bending to make it sound like I am doing whammy bar stuff, because I don't have a whammy bar.\u000a\u000aI think it might, I'll have to check the mic settings in the DAW the next time I write drum parts.

aVThank you!
p5330
aVDo you ever plan on getting a whole band? Or are you just going to keep releasing on your own. \u000a\u000aMaybe when I get some more material we can do a split or something.
p5331
aVIf I can find the right musicians.  I'm really picky on who I would work with and anyone I worked with would pretty much have to have identical tastes to mine and be ready to do what I tell them to in terms of what to play and how to do it, so I already know I'm impossible to work with unless I have the perfect people who I can actually trust to do things in a way that I would like.  I also have no patience for people caught up in drugs and alcohol - so the first sign I saw of someone having a problem with that I would remove them permanently from my band and my life.\u000a\u000aI have no interest in playing live either, Treeweaver will be a studio band for the forseeable future.  I kind of approach this the same way that Darkthrone do.  I would be up for a split if I had the money to fund the physical media and the right band to do the split with.
p5332
aVMore power to you for having a vision. I know the feeling of not having anyone to be able to keep up. I have another guitar player that I have been jamming with since he started, so we have complementing styles. I have never been able to find a drummer though...which is why I use Drumkit from Hell.\u000a\u000a

aVI record vocals through a Shure SM58 and then just the default logic compressor with the vocal default, since I don't know too much about mixing vocals. For some parts just the Logic Delay. The only VST outside of Logic that I use is LePou's Legion VST.
p5347
aVcool, I have the same mic. But my vocals sit off from the mix a bit. Yours' blend in nicely. 
p5348
aVYeah, I had spent a long time struggling to make it sound like the vocals weren't just pasted on top of the song, and I read a lot about compressors. From what I understand, compressors generally have the same settings, so I took a pic of the settings I used, hopefully it can help you.\u000ahttp://imgur.com/D5ewNdT

asVHey heres me playing "The Dehumanizing Process" by Chimaira on drums. Feedback always appreciated!
p5363
(lp5364
VGreat job! Your double bass control is excellent, and you've got great coordination. The two things I do recommend are that you hit a little harder, although I can't really tell from the camera angle, the drum tones seem a little weak. This is metal! Don't be afraid do go all out! Also, you might want to work a bit on feel. You've got all the notes down, but you should impart a feel to the song and make it your own. I frequently see metal drummers who can play really fast, but have nothing that distinguishes them from the rest of the pack in terms of feel. Don't be afraid to break up sixteenth-notes into lombardo-like fills, or use double strokes and buzz strokes to give your fills a different sound and make them more interesting.

VI like the tone you've got going a lot. What is it you're using, if you don't mind me asking?\u000a\u000aAnd if I may offer some positive criticism.. I found the drums to be the weakest part.

p5371
aVThanks for the comment!  I agree, the drums are weak, but not being a drummer, the fills I program always sound forced, but I'm slowly getting better!\u000a\u000aAs for the tone, I'm using a Line 6 POD HD and the "Treadplate" amp model.  If you happen to have a POD HD, I could upload the patch.  It's got some compression pedals, 2 noise gates, and a tube screamer (gain set to zero, but volume set to max) in the chain as well.  And of course, most importantly, I have 2 separate guitar tracks hard panned to the left and right.\u000a\u000aI've got more stuff on the soundcloud account I linked to, and a bunch of older stuff on my bandcamp at what-is-sleep.com

aVSounds good man. Id bring up the treble on the djenty axes a bit. Maybe a little more bottom end on a bass guitar to make it sit better. Only thing with the drums ins the snare... sounds just a little flat... I guess I would call it. Find a better sample with a lil more thickness and reverb.

p5385
aVYou might want to work on your tone, i new what you were running because I did the same thing, clean channel with a distortion type deal, the problem is the chugs are flubby, and higher notes are squeeky. Try using whatever amp sim you are using with the gain at only around three on the crunch channel and mids at like 5 (unmetal  i know) and just use a tubescreamer to crank the gain without using clarity. I always thiught the secret to a metal tone was mids at 2, clean channel, and a fullbore metal pedal, when i just used a peavey 6505 clone with a tubescreamer I was blown away at how good it sounded. Sorry if you already knew all this and dont mistake it as criticism/tooting my own horn(even if I am a little) i really like the song!

asVWhere else do you promote your music?
p5426
(lp5427
VStart putting together press releases and hammering the blogs that cover your style of music.  Don't expect the big ones to give you the time of day.  Write personal emails to the blogs you dig, and don't just copy paste the same thing to everyone.  Mention something about their blog that you like so they know you've actually read it, and aren't just trying to glean any and all press you can.  This has been pretty successful for my band.  Another thing we've done that helps is to send your biggest supporters freebies.  If you have merch and a bandcamp page, send stickers to anyone who's ever paid for your stuff.  About two years ago my band put together a mailing list of everyone who paid for our stuff (even though it was free) and sent them each five stickers with a note asking them to hand them out to their friends or post them up at venues around town.  People loved it, and fans will always be stoked on free shit.  Stickers are essentially cheap marketing, so never make anyone pay for them, and give them out liberally.  
p5428
aVExcellent! Good sticker manufacturers?
p5429
aVWe've been using 123stickers.com, which is the cheapest high-quality stuff we've found thus far.

aVI'm extremely interested in the answers to these questions myself. Also, fuck it, lets start here: check out my deathgrind side project and I'll check your shit out!\u000a \u000ahttp://burdensofmisanthropy.bandcamp.com/
p5431
aV**Reddit**\u000aFind subreddits that will fit your style and post there, make up some clever title. Do not just post "Band - Song title", because nobody will check it out unless you're already famous.\u000aAlso if a song is about something, like a fantasy theme, you could probably get some listens at /r/fantasy or something like that.\u000a\u000a**Youtube**\u000aMake music videos, playthroughs, covers on youtube and if your content is good maybe the views will trickle over on your own stuff. Don't forget to tag stuff.\u000aIf you make a music video you can post it to http://www.blanktv.com/\u000aIf you're lucky a couple of thousands of people will see the video.\u000a\u000a**Forums**\u000aI hung out a lot at http://sevenstring.org/ and met some bloggers there who promoted my band for a while. Ultimate-guitar seems pretty nice too. If you have the time the best way to get notices is to form contacts with people who can spread the music.\u000a\u000a**Facebook**\u000aFacebook worked better before, but it's still one of the better places to share music. Make a page, make it look nice and message promotion pages and try to get them to post your music, there's a lot of them.\u000aOr you can spend some money on advertising (not recommended) my page got 10000 likes for about 300 dollars but most of them are empty likes. Try to have continuous content to post on facebook or people will forget the page, it's hard, I try to post stuff as often as I can but I do it way to little.\u000a\u000a**Bandcamp**\u000aGreat page, you can even get some cash if people like your stuff, pay what you want option is the way to go as an independent band. Make it look nice. [My bandcamp](http://empirine.bandcamp.com/) Same here, don't forget tags.\u000a\u000a**Twitter**\u000aAlso good if you know how to use it (I don't).\u000a\u000aEverything I write on facebook also posts on my twitter acount. My bandcamp page and Youtube page are linked to my facebook page [Empirine!](https://www.facebook.com/Empirine)\u000a\u000a**Friends, contacts and blogs**\u000aProbably the best way to spread music, share music to friends, get in touch with people who might like your stuff, write personal messages to smaller blogs.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVYoutube is usually a good bet, although it has gone downhill considerably since I started using it. You just have to talk to people on their channel and they are usually willing to watch your videos and subscribe if you ask or do the same for them. If you have a video camera (Like on your phone), and recording equipment, which it sounds like you do, you can make a decent video. Even some of my crappy videos got over 1k views, and you can always use them as a quick reference when telling someone about your music.  \u000aHere's my youtube channel www.youtube.com/tfo13y 
p5435
aVHave you submitted to e-zines or magazines at all? Like Metal Injection, Heavy Blog is Heavy, NoiseCreep, etc? Getting reviews out is one method. Also check metal podcasts and radios and see if you can get your music added.
p5436
aVSeriously, I think promotion for independent bands is incredibly hard these days. We released our album recently, and contacted at least 60 press outlets, from print magazines to webzines to respected blogs. From that, we got fewer than 10 reviews, and some of those were only because we had prior connections with the site or writer.\u000a\u000aYouTube is a joke for promo, and in fact it makes me angry just thinking about how Google profit off musicians while making it tougher for us. If you post your own videos on YouTube hardly anybody will see them, because there's nearly zero discoverability. However, there are a small handful of users who have a massive subscriber base, and if you're lucky enough to have them post up your video, it'll help a lot. But those users get shut down after a while because they are primarily breaching copyright. If these guys were careful to stick to unsigned bands and getting permission to upload, this could be a great route to reach people, but that doesn't seem to be how it's working out.\u000a\u000aLast.fm *should* have been a great way to spread the word, allowing your band to bask in the reflected glory of similar bands and allow people to easily find more of the music they like. But no, CBS have let it go to shit, the original developers have all left, and the site is slowly atrophying away.\u000a\u000aTL;DR - I don't know, and very little works these days!

I have about 10 more of these that I need to track drums and bass to. One day Ill have a full song!\u000a\u000aEdit:formatting
p5463
asVMy guitars sound flat and I don't know how to fix it.
p5464
(lp5465
VOk, here's the main offender: you're not using a real amp. The sound you want\u2014what you hear in your head\u2014it's there by association with the music you love, which is made using real amps and cabinets. However, there are some tricks to getting amp simulators to sound pretty fucking killer. \u000a\u000a1. This tone is allllllll mids, especially high-mids. Mids are good\u2014that's what you're selling with electric guitar. But in metal, regardless of the subgenre, we tend to cum for those chuggy lows, so they need to strike a hair-fine balance between being recognizably present, while not occulting the bass and the kick drum. I see you've got a pretty drastic, wide-Q cut around 300-400 Hz. Smart thinking, because this is basically the most offensive part of the Misery Range (300-700 Hz), but that perception is only relevant when you've got all your instruments tracked out and you're ready to seriously mix. So kill that notch until you've got a bass thumping around.  \u000a2. Is this amp sim patch entirely of your own creation? Consider starting with a factory preset that comes close to what you hear in your head, and altering it until it's even closer. \u000a3. Amp sims can sound better if your guitar signal passes through a real vacuum tube before it hits your converter. It doesn't have to be any fancy, boutique piece of equipment. At $40, [this guy](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/art-tube-mp-studio-mic-preamp) will work some wonders.\u000a\u000a4. Are you aware of the concept of Unity Gain? It basically states that Unity is when an output signal is equal to its respective input signal. On hardware equipment, Unity is defined as 0 dBVU (Volume Units). However; you're working strictly in the digital domain, which doesn't measure amplitude in Volume Units\u2014it uses the Full Scale, or dBFS. In the Full Scale, 0 dBVU is approximately equal to -18 dBFS. Here's a huge secret: When the developers are doing R&amp;D for plugins that will emulate hardware, they use signals **at -18 dBFS.** So when you have your guitar plugged in, bypass your plugins and start playing, simultaneously adjusting your gain while watching your meter in Ableton. You want your incoming guitar signal *pre-amp sim* to average at -18 (expand the width and height of Ableton's track view to display numbered meter labels). Just eyeball it until you feel that it hovers there during most playing. And as always, aim for peaks preferably under -6. If you decide to get a little tube preamp, make sure its VU meter averages at 0, while still aiming for -18 inside your DAW. If your signal is closer to what the developers used to make an emulator, you'll achieve a higher degree of realism.\u000a\u000aOther than these tricks, go over to /r/audioengineering, and everyone there will tell you that what matters most is your perception in context. If you've been doing your research about mixing, you know that rule number freaking ONE is to **never hit that solo button,** because nobody cares what a track sounds like in solo. Don't use solo to get your guitar sounding cool. Listen to *everything* to make it sound *right.* If you were to get stems of your favorite album with your favorite guitar tone and listen to the isolated guitar tracks out of context, I guarantee you'd think they sound like ass.\u000a
p5466
aVSome further points regarding "flatness." This might be, in addition to a harmonic perception, a dynamic one. I see you've got a multiband compressor AND a single band compressor going on in the mastering chain. First of all, you don't need a mastering chain while you're tracking, because it's fucking with your perception. Secondly, these are high-gain, dirt guitars, which means distortion. Distortion is *literally* compression, so adding more on top is redundant and will easily slaughter any kind of excitement your guitars are generating if you get too heavy-handed. As for the multicomp, try engaging just the mids and highs but leaving the lows untreated. This will allow you to gently squeeze your mids and high mids, while letting your lacking lows shine through. 
p5467
aVI really really appreciate your thoughts on the matter.\u000a\u000aAs far as real amp go- yeah it would be awesome if I could have some of that really expensive gear, but as someone who's living in an apartment right now and just learning how to record I figured a good starting off point would be using amp sims and vsts since it's considerably cheaper and there are some tutorials and information out there about using them.\u000a\u000aThe amp sim I'm using is a Catharsis sim, which seems to be highly recommended in the amp sim world.\u000a\u000aI've read some stuff about the unity. My basic understanding was to not get in the red ever. I'm using a focusrite 2i2 and once I've got the gate, overdrive, head, and cab set up I just need to adjust the gain to right under the point where I'm still in the green. Individually I've also lowered the track volumes. All the guitars are -6db. Is this on the right track? This seems a little more higher level than the stuff I've read so far.\u000a\u000aI definitely agree about not using the effects on the master while tracking. I put all that after I was done. Honestly the only reason I added additional compression was because I haven't figured out how to increase the volume in post. Yeah, I'm still really new to this stuff...\u000a\u000aAgain thanks a lot. Hopefully I can make some more progress when I get a bass again. I'll keep playing with it and use your advice.

aV[deleted]

aVYep, that's exactly what you would do, with one important point: if your interface has built in pre's (as most prosumer products nowadays tend to), it probably has a multiple different input voltage modes that you choose using a selector switch, possibly labeled *mic, line, mic/line,* or *DI,* which will sometimes be called *Hi-Z*. It's critical that you use the correct voltage. [[lazy link explanation here]](https://www.google.com/search?q=impedance+matching&amp;oq=impedance+ma&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.3649j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8)\u000a\u000aFor example, my little portable interface (mbox mini from 2010) has Mic/Line on a Neutrik connector (the combination XLR\u20131/4" jack), and a separate 1/4" jack for DI, with a push switch that selects between the two.  \u000a\u000aWhen you want to plug your instrument straight in, you use your regular unbalanced instrument cable (high impedance/hi-Z, TS jack\u2014the 1/4" with ONE black ring), and plug it into the DI connection, making sure to select DI.  \u000aIf you're going to use a preamp in front, plug the instrument cable into its 1/4" input, then connect a BALANCED cable (low impedance/low-Z, TRS jack\u2014the 1/4" with TWO black rings) from its 1/4" output to your interface's LINE input connection, being sure to select line. \u000a\u000aThe reason for this is that, first of all, a preamp's job is to bring a signal to UP to line level, and a DI's job is to bring a signal DOWN to line level. A DI is essentially a step-down electrical transformer. In particular with the little ART pre, it functions as BOTH. It has a step-down transformer inside it, which is bypassed when you use the mic input, but engaged when you use the instrument input. When you use the instrument input, it takes your guitar's hi-Z signal, brings it down to line voltage, and then spits out a balanced line signal. So if you plugged a line level signal into yet another DI, you'd be redundantly, detrimentally diminishing the voltage and thus the amplitude and quality of your signal.

aVi took your advice the best I could. I started by significantly lowering the volume on each tracks volume fader. I think I did about -13db on each track except the solos.\u000a\u000aOn the guitars I also lowered the gain on the amp sim and used a different impulse that isn't as bright.\u000a\u000aThen on the master track I added multiband compressor and boosted the highs a little and boosted the gain in the limiter.\u000a\u000aCall me crazy, but I think this new recording sounds like an improvement. Thoughts? https://soundcloud.com/user4081301/devil
p5471
aVI would dial the tone knob on the TSE pedal a bit, to add a little 'beef' to the mid range. Somewhere around the 2 o'clock give or take is what i do.\u000a You could also slightly turn down contour and presence, and turn up mids on the Legion, though depending on how attached you are to this Poulin amp, i would suggest another amp sim as the Legion's gain is too fizzy for me.\u000aOn LeCab, can i assume you aren't double tracking by recording the left and right simultaneously as your picture shows? The only time i record both the left and right at the same time is if one side is the mainsource, while the other is an ambient signal, such as a room mic impulse with reverb. Even then, i still do the same on the opposite side, essentially quad tracking. Also, try using a different impulse with a lower presence or indirect mic position, as well as adding additional impulses, such as different mics and mic positions, on top of what you have.
p5472
aVI like the Catharsis impulses too, but the preshigh ones are thin, and they're probably cutting out your lows regardless of the amp head settings. Try the pres5 or pres8 ones to let some beef back in, then go on and try MagniumXL's suggestions. You probably don't need your overdrive pedal's volume cranked all the way up, either; try backing that down to 12 o'clock and going from there. Like dropitonitshead mentioned, extra distortion can flatten your performance.
p5473
aVI'd vote that the snare drum is too loud and too dull and detracts from anything else anything else is doing. Tried maybe mixing up the effects? a slight bit of reverb, some vibrato or bends chucked in? 
p5474
aVWhen was the last time you changed your strings?\u000a\u000aEdit: Also way too much gain.
p5475
aVGoing direct into your PC is kind of tricky. Usually its best to layer more than 1 guitar if you can't mic up a cab, even then its always best to layer more than 1 guitar and use a stereo field expander.  I didn't spend that much and my recordings sound like bombs!

p5484
aVI'll listen to this when I get home since I don't have any speakers at work, but I have to ask... you're going to go with a nine and a half minute song as your single?
p5485
aVYeah. Why not? Singles have always been a tease imo, so I've always liked it when bands put out really long singles. Plus we all agreed it was our favorite song from the EP. 
p5486
aVIs the point of the single to get played either on a radio station (college, satellite, etc.) or a podcast or something?  I just think it's a very difficult sell to a program director or whoever the hell it is who makes the playlist to convince them to play one song when they could have played 2 or 3 in the same timeframe.
p5487
aVWell that may be the point in some places but there are NO metal radio stations around here. This is really just holding people over until the full EP comes out. \u000a\u000aWe've mainly used a lot of metal promotion pages on facebook like Total Deathcore, Pig Squeals and Breakdowns, etc. I've never liked people automatically thinking we were deathcore because of the page so we're releasing this EP through Djentlemans Club this time. We're not necessarily "djent" either, but it's at least a little more accurate.
p5488
aVI like the off beat rhythms you have going on in some of the parts, and the short clean sections you throw in throughout. While that one guy was being a dick, there were some generic metalcore parts towards the beginning, although you guys offset it well with more original sections. I think I hear some slide guitar in there too, which is pretty sweet
p5489
aVYes! You did! The only thing that sucks is that I haven't really been able to come up with an effective way to play the slide part live since I use my ring finger. I'm working on it, though. And thank you for pointing out parts you think are generic without being a cunt, haha. It's a rarity.
p5490
aVI put my slide on my pinky so it doesn't get in the way as much, although it makes it a little harder to play with slide cleanly. But take that advice with a grain of salt, I am not very good at slide guitar.

aVGeneric metalcore. Yawn.

aVI'm not useless. I just cooked a sixteen-set breakfast for a small party of thirty people at my girlfriend's friend's house. Week before today, I swapped out the spark plugs in my girlfriend's Sentra, changed the oil, and retensioned the throttle and clutch cables during blasting snow. Last friday, I walked eight miles into the city to apply for a job, nailed the interview, then walked an additional six miles to the facility which performed the drug screening and D.O.T. physical. \u000a\u000aI'm far from useless.

Vhow did you get that bass tone? You're good with mixing, so you're ahead of the game from most people. Deff. invest in a good amp combo half stack if you can like jarhead said.

aVThe bass is actually done by a bass lol. I'm using a good bass from what I can tell, but I'm just borrowing it while I record.\u000a\u000aThanks for the compliment and the suggestion!
p5578
aVI'm still new to bass but I can get tone similar to this with new round-wound strings, playing mostly bridge pickup and cranking the highs on the amp until you can hear the clanking string noise. A pick can help bring it out too.
p5579
aVHow about a bass?, Active 5 strings are great for metal.
p5580
aVCheck out agile guitars, they usually run around your price range on ebay and such. Also, depending on how attached you are to your current guitar, you could also swap out the pickups for some better ones.
p5581
aV+1 for Agile guitars especially if you're trying to downtune, you can get awesome quality extended scale length guitars for cheap
p5582
aVFor $500 you can get a pretty sweet schecter with some decent pickups. Lowest quality I'd go for is EMGs. Active pups get you a nice metal sound, but lately I'm more into passive stuff like BKP. They're crazy expensive though, $450 per set ish..I like Ibanez the best...get a decent Ibanez, upgrade the pups and you have a sick guitar.\u000aAs far as an amp goes..for $500 you can find a 5150 on CL. This is THE amp for metal. I guarantee all your favourite metal albums were recorded with some version of this amp. To get the best sound you'd have to get yourself a speaker cab to go with it. 2x12 is the smallest I'd go for that sounds good. 4x12 is better, but it starts to get pretty pricey.\u000aThrow the muff away. That shit's no good for metal. What you want as far as pedals go is a solid Overdrive pedal. Ibanez TS-9 or TS-808 or the Maxon versions OD-9 or OD-808 tend to be the favourites. They tighten up the low end and can really make the amp scream.\u000aHope this helps!

I like some of your different ideas, like the style on "El Portador de la Muerte".\u000a\u000a\u000aMay I ask how you amped your guitars? They don't seem like software amp sims. \u000a\u000a\u000aAlso, if you'd like a little mix feedback, I think everything sounds really good and clear but the drums could be a bit "bigger" for my taste. Granted, I'm listening at a quiet volume right now, so I could be wrong. I'm not sure if they're lacking some room sound or if they're a bit clicky for me. Anyway, everything sounds great but I thought I'd point out what I could if I had to choose a weaker area. 
p5590
aVThanks a ton! \u000a\u000aThe guitar tone is actually BIAS with a TSE808 in front and some impulses I liked. BIAS is *insanely* good.\u000a\u000aAnd the drums are for sure a weak spot. I like really tight, low reverb drums, but the snare turned out a bit thin and I couldn't get it to sound fuller without it sounding ugly to my ears. Oh well. I'll be using different samples on the next release!\u000a\u000aThanks again for the feedback, I appreciate it!
p5591
aVVery impressive, the mix sounds really good and tight. That DFH snare does sound thin but it still sounds good. I'm trying to do the same thing you are but not proggy mathcore. My Mixes right now are way too quiet, need to work on my production. check me out. https://oceanicmotion.bandcamp.com/

aVThanks!\u000a\u000aWow, I don't think I've heard anything like that before, awesome tunes! Some of those riffs, especially that melodic section in the middle of Flutter, have an almost deftones-with-blastbeats vibe, I really dig it!\u000a\u000aAnd as for the mixes, I don't think they're too quiet necessarily, and I don't know exactly what sound you're going for, but it sounds like the guitars could be turned down ever so slightly, the snare could be a little more present, and the bass is missing low end and could be a bit more present too. But again, I don't know what sound you're going after, that's just what I'm hearing.
p5593
aVReally cool stuff! What kind of vocals do you envision on this? When this was playing, I could envision vocals all the way from ambient vocals similar to the first Cynic album (not necessarily on all tracks), all the way to Jens from Meshuggah, to Megadeath/Testament/Bay Area Thrash vocals in a lot of spots. Definitely a very diverse album. \u005cm/
p5594
aVThanks so much!\u000a\u000aIn a perfect world, I'd love to find a jack-of-all-trades vocalist, but as long as I find someone who can do nice cleans and melodic singing in addition to the aggressive vocals, I'd be more than happy. I think I'll know it when I hear it.
p5595
aVDo you have any/partial lyrics written? If so, any particular theme or concept in mind? Or were you planning on having a vocalist sing over it and write vocals according to their own interpretation?

aVI'm not much of a lyricist, and for The Vermilion Lotus I would leave it to a vocalist's interpretation, but I have some new stuff I've been working on with a definite theme and concept and I would love to work with a vocalist on getting a narrative going and whatnot.

asVfloyd-rose intonation/maintenance etc.
p5601
(lp5602
VA properly intonated bridge is absolutely essential. Setting up a Floyd can take a while especially if you're new. I won't go through the entire process but quickly:\u000a\u000aThe bridge floats which means a balance between string tension and spring tension (springs accessible under the cover plate on the back of the guitar) must match. The way to tell if they match is by ensuring the bridge floats parallel to the surface of your guitar body. If the bridge rides low or pulls up, you're doing it wrong. Additional springs can be purchased if more tension at the bridge is required. I recall having 5 springs in my Floyd when I had it.\u000a\u000aWhen you restring, you want to set the adjustment for the saddles on each string to half-way. That way, if/when you need to adjust intonation on the strings, you have equal room for adjustment in both directions.\u000a\u000aWhen you re-string, stretch your strings extensively so there is no stretching "slack" left in them. If you fail to do this, then tighten up all the blocks at the nut, the strings will continuously go out of tune as you play and especially when you bend. This will then require loosening all the nut bolts, re-tuning, which is a pain in the ass because...\u000a\u000aSince the bridge floats, any change in overall string tension, for any reason, will directly affect the bridge. Strings that aren't stretched out before nut bolts are tightened will stretch afterward and the overall string tension will drop, and the bridge will sink because it's now pulling too hard. Tuning up after re-stringing can be a pain, because you pretty much have to cycle through all the strings 4-5 times, then stretch them all out, then cycle through them all again 3-4 times, then stretch them all again, then cycle through again 3-4 times and just keep doing this over and over and over again until stretching has zero effect on tuning. You will likely have to adjust the bridge slightly while you do this as well, to keep it parallel with the body, which ensures proper intonation is even possible.\u000a\u000aWhen you adjust the bridge tighter (by tightening the screws inside the body/bridge cavity) it will *pull* the strings tighter and raise the entire guitar's tuning up a bit. That means you have to down-tune a little bit again! Of course, when you do this, the bridge again pulls harder and drops down because the overall string tension just dropped when you tuned it down a bit. So now you have to fucking loosen the screws a little bit so the bridge comes parallel again. But now the strings are going sharp again because the bridge just eased up a bit... you can see where this is going, right?\u000a\u000aOne rule of thumb I used to always follow is this: Take it in small steps and always take into account the equal and opposite reaction that will occur at the other end when you are adjusting the strings or springs. \u000a\u000aIt seems like a lot but it's really quite simple. It's just a balancing act. The bridge is a fulcrum with two things yanking at it from either side. Equalize them, and get the side with strings on it to also be in tune and well-stretched out so there is no slack in them. After that, tighten it all up and you can literally do anything to that guitar and it will *never* come out of tune.\u000a\u000aFinally -- when you re-string and are tightening the small little bridge-blocks onto the string, don't over-tighten. These blocks can and will crack and fail if you go nuts. Just make it tight, don't kill it.

aVIn addition to this, to get yourself close: \u000a\u000a- back off your springs drastically so there's basically no tension\u000a\u000a- put one string in, tighten a little so that the bridge is a little above parallel\u000a\u000a- insert the number of pennies in the cavity between the bridge block and the back side of the cavity to bring the just about parallel (I use electrical tape to keep the pennies together)\u000a\u000a- string up the guitar completely to tension\u000a\u000a- screw in the spring harness until the pennies just slip\u000a\u000aNow your bridge tension should be set up properly, but if your intonation is off too, I would suggest looking into a tool called the key from Stew-mac that holds onto your string block so you can micro adjust the position for intonation.\u000a\u000aGood luck.

asVNewbie needs help for "live"sound but with no budget for upgrades
p5608
(lp5609
VI don't have much experience with live sound but i know a few things from a recording standpoint.\u000a\u000aEq - You might find this useful for making each instrument you feed into the mixer stand out more. Think high passing the guitars to make the drums / bass more audible in the low end. It's not hard to learn yourself, if think of it in terms of frequency.\u000a\u000aIf you're having trouble with the vocal mics, try making sure they stay away from the mic'd cabs and monitors. Reducing the stage volume would probably help too, if you've got a lot of microphones, reducing bleed will help. \u000a\u000aA noise gate could be useful on your drums, think of it like this - You set a volume level, and then any time the microphone picks up a level quieter than that, it will instead just be silent. Useful for a kick, if you don't want bleed in the signal. \u000a\u000aCompressors are useful in the studio, i wouldn't bother with one live, except for MAYBE on vocals. It pretty much evens out the differences between peaks in volume from a mic by reducing the volume whenever the volume spikes. \u000a\u000aHopefully that helps a bit.\u000aCheers\u000a\u000a\u000a

asVPain in wrist while playing
p5611
(lp5612
VI'd suggest moving your guitar strap just to change the angle you're playing, assuming you're standing up. Are you fretting your notes way too hard? Try to ease up whatever tension you have but do give it a good break.\u000a\u000aI had carpal tunnel in my wrist that lasted a few months and still feels funny sometimes, what helped me was changing things around when it came to my computer, the angle at which I type, hold my mouse etc.\u000a\u000aIt's not fun, hope you heal up soon!
p5613
aVThanks, I'll experiment with different angles. I don't think I'm fretting too hard but I'll keep an eye on that when I play.
p5614
aVGoing off of Strychn9ne, your wrists and fingers should definitely be loose when playing, if your tensing up that means you need to practice it slower until you can play it more easily. When I started to encounter these problems I began to stretch my hands and wrists. This helped me A LOT.  \u000aTo stretch your four fingers put your arm out and gently pull back on the tips of your fingers toward the top of your hand and hold it for a few seconds. For your thumb, make a 'thumbs up' and gently pull back on the tip of your thumb for a few seconds.  \u000aThe third thing to do is WARM UP, this is very important because if you just jump into shredding you can do some serious harm to your wrists. You should do a warm up every time you pick up the guitar or after every hour or so (This is if your practicing some serious demanding stuff which it sounds like you are, otherwise you probably don't need to as often). I do all of these things and I haven't had a problem in a long time.  \u000aIf your doing these things and it still hurts I also agree with Strychn9ne that you should adjust your guitar's angle while standing. Practicing slowly while standing helps too because your wrist is at a very different angle when playing sitting down and is used to it that way if that's how you normally practice.  \u000aI hope this helps! \u005cm/
p5615
aVThere's some great advice here, thanks.\u000a\u000aThe stretching thing I've never done, it sounds like a pretty good idea though. I always warm up by playing something easy and gradually building up into the more complicated stuff so I don't think that's the problem.\u000a\u000aThanks man!
p5616
aV[deleted]
p5617
aVDude. Stretch. Might seem tedious to spend 5-10 minutes doing nothing but stretching before you shred but trust me\u2026it's worth it.\u000a\u000aDon't get all fancy. Just YouTube some guitar player stretches and do what feels good without going too far into what feels painful.\u000a\u000aAfter you've stretched I bet you'll be surprised at how much easier things get.
p5618
aVI feel your pain. \u000a\u000aI wear wristbands to help. I believe it's the pressure that helps with the tendons. Stretches before playing helps too. If you do them afterwards it wont help at all. I also make sure to always warm up with scales before playing longer than 20 minutes.
p5619
aVWas it this fucking Willie Adler riff towards the end of the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqgJc7DaDU4#t=182 ?\u000a\u000aCause even when stretching beforehand, that riff kills me after a while. I dig Willie's writing style, but holy shit, does he write some crazy stuff.
p5620
aVIf you're talking about the 6/8 riff over the "if there was a day I can live" part, then yes. It's a combination of that and the main verse riff.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, I haaaate that riff. It's horrible to play, the fingerings are so awkward!
p5621
aVThat's the one! Fucking Willie.
p5622
aVThis is actually one of my favorite riffs ever. Ashes of the Wake is one of my favorite records /ever/ and for my rhythm chops development one of my ultimate goals is to be able to play the whole album. I can only play the first 5 songs so far, but I'm coming for Blood of the Scribe! :D\u000a\u000aAlso, by /far/ the hardest riff of theirs that I know is the weedly woodly riff at the end of Hourglass. That shit /tireees/ you.
p5623
aVStretch and warm up. I used to have pain I'm my picking wrist and elbow because I would dive into Slayer right away. Even guys like Marty Friedman will say they had pain when they didn't warm up. \u000a\u000aThere is a classical or flamenco guitarist who would play the first couple songs in his set at maybe half the speed (it's painful to watch) to warm up. So you can do that if scales and patterns bore you. 
p5624
aVFor something that hasn't been mentioned, you might be gripping too hard with your thumb. The strings only really need a bit of pressure on the fret to produce sound. Try fretting as light as possible while producing a clear sound to test how hard you actually need to press and adjust to that, and if your wrist still hurts, you might have to lower the action. It'll help you play faster anyway.

asVHardware advice \u2013 getting a good guitar sound
p5645
(lp5646
VThe Pods, you can gig with. Software, not so much.\u000a\u000aYou can get amps and cabs of equal or higher quality to the Pods as freeware these days. But the other effects... choice there is a bit more limited. The situation is better if you go with dedicated guitar software - eg. Revalver, Overloud, Guitar Rig, etc - but even there the array and quality of effects doesn't always match what you get in a Pod or a Boss multi-effects unit, in my opinion.\u000a\u000aAlso, software is ideal for tinkerers - there are communities of bedroom guitarists who have nothing better to do than try out each of 1000 different cabinet impulses. With something like a Pod, the selection work has mostly been done for you, as you can start from a basic preset and amend it. Again, the middle ground is the integrated guitar software suites which will sometimes give you usable presets (and sometimes not).
p5647
aVI would in this situation consider if i would be satisfied with the tones and effects the POD provides, based on demos and perhaps trying one myself. I'd assume that the POD would have a bypass feature to send a dry signal via usb, so on top of being able to use native POD effects, you still have the option of using computer software and vst's. The POD also has the added benefit of taking some load off your computer's CPU when dealing with signal processing, which would be important if your computer specs aren't too hot. The added hardware features aren't too shabby either, though if you're strictly doing DI recording, you might not find much use for some I/O options. u/kylotan also brings a good point that the POD works well with gigs and live settings.\u000a\u000aI think it all comes down to whether or not you feel the POD's built in software features are worth the price difference. The AVID interface and the full retail price of either Guitar Rig or Amplitude will run you about $370ish, and at the very least you'll only pay $170 for the interface if you run solely on free vst's. Can't say personally if the POD is worth spending the extra buck, as i'm indifferent to Line 6 products, so you're going to need to determine where your budget fits your needs.
p5648
aVIf you're recording but not gigging, just get an interface and use free or cheap amp sims. Ignite Amps, LePou, TSE, Recabinet, and Peavey (Revalver) all make very realistic-sounding amp sim plugins. Pair these with Ignite's NadIR impulse response loader and an OwnHammer Mesa 4X12 cab impulse library for $10 you'll be good to go. \u000a\u000aIf you're gigging and recording or just gigging, the POD is a better option for flexibility and routing options. You can't gig with a laptop. Its cabs sound awful though, so I'd buy a real cab and a Crown power amp or something to go with it. I just sold my POD for a Kemper because the amp models aren't very good either in terms of realism.\u000a\u000aFor DAWs, Reaper is unbeatable for the price imo. For interfaces, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING ENTRY-LEVEL MADE BY FOCUSRITE hahah. I cannot stress this enough. Every third post on every forum I go on is "my scarlett 2i2 is clipping." Mackie's Onyx Blackjack is a great choice, and I use a Roland Quad Capture. 
p5649
aVi'm just recording, but i use logic pro x, do you happen to know if all the amp sims you're referring me to are mac-compatible?
p5650
aVYes. I work on a MacBook Pro.
p5651
aVsweet, i'll look into them. i'm not familiar with using an impulse response loader, could you explain what it is/how it's used?\u000a\u000athanks so much btw! this is really helpful
p5652
aVNo prob! [This should help.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfh_ZkyZtwg) \u000a\u000aThe short version: an impulse response is a .wav file that somebody has created using a real amp and cabinet. It simulates the specific sound of a microphone(s) capturing the sound of a cab and power amp. All the amp sims I listed are just that- simulations of the amp itself, not the cab. The file itself is tiny, no more than a few kb and just a short click noise. You put this file in an impulse loader program (again, I highly recommend NadIR) and it completes your guitar tone by adding the cab and power amp coloration.\u000a\u000aSo your chain looks like this:\u000a\u000aGuitar --&gt; interface --&gt; raw sound of the guitar straight into a new track in your audio workstation, like ProTools or Reaper --&gt; digital signal chain as effects inserts on the track, which usually consists of a noise gate, tube screamer pedal sim, amp sim, and impulse loader with an impulse of your choice.*\u000a\u000a*Some software (Revalver, TSE) comes with a screamer and noise gate as part of the package, and some also have an impulse loader. But if you use the Ignite Amps or LePou stuff, they do not come with these things. \u000a\u000a

I feel like I only heard two riffs for the first 3:45 of the song.\u000a* Drums are bit boring, though it's a demo so maybe they're a machine or purposefully done just to maintain pacing/timing.\u000a\u000aThis should probably be a 3:30 song instead of almost 6 minutes unless you work new riffs in there.  I'm not saying you should go all out and like never repeat riffs like Protest the Hero is wont to do, but a little more variety would make this song a lot better.  For comparison [here's a song](https://soundcloud.com/yeltsinstwelfthliver/malltropolis) from my band's demo that's about the same length.  Maybe it's just me but I get bored playing the same riffs all the time so I'm constantly changing it up.\u000a\u000aAlso I'm curious what the song structure is... seems like it's verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/solo and then it just sort of ends.\u000a

p5664
(lp5665
VI send the drums through a reverb, in most cases totally wet. You can experiment with it and just send the cymbals through it. Different Reverbs offer different tones, modify hall or even try spring reverb.\u000aFor Doom songs, i sometimes even place the drums in a cathedral:\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/infold/d-j-vu\u000a(Demo, no EQ or Compression)\u000a\u000aIs this what you mean with "washed"? If you want to harsh up the cymbals, also slight eq + compression will help you shape the sound.
p5666
aVThanks, that's mostly what I'm talking about. I think it sounds killer!
p5667
aVListening to the tracks your posted, its definitely reverb and some EQ giving them that tone. I cant speak for the EQ you'd need for the speakers without hearing them and generalizing a lot, but a nice cut below approx 5.5 kHz should give you a bit more room in the mix. If you can post a sample i can work out a good decent EQ for you.\u000a\u000aAs for the reverb, what you need is a quite a long reverb, in a smaller room, but your gonna want a couple of milliseconds pre delay too. Most build in reverbs should have controls you can fiddle about with, so you shouldnt have to buy any software.
p5668
aVWell, I haven't done any recording yet with that project in particular. But I think this is the best drum tone I've gotten so far (from a grind song) and I used reverb on the snares and cymbals as well as boosted some high frequencies.\u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/vincent_wisehoon/rot\u000a\u000aBoth tweaks were very minor though. You can still hear cymbals like they're individual shuffles, it sounds more like a tech-death kit or something. I think I will take your advice though and try that specific cut as well as drench it in small room reverb.

asVDoes anybody here know anything about orchestration? Critique wanted! [soundcloud]
p5683
(lp5684
VOrchestration is about tonal combinations. Flute + Clarinet = Flutinet. Having certain instruments play identical lines creates a new sound. Want a trumpet to cut through? Double it with the flute and piccolo to add some shrill. Cello not warm enough? Pepper some bassoon on it to fatten it up. 
p5685
aVSounds great. Also, your send you to burn song sounds fucking amazing. Very well done. \u000a
p5686
aVThis is pretty solid compositionally. Some tips if you want to plan on making a really serious project: \u000a\u000aLook up pictures of how orchestras are arranged physically. Write your parts accordingly, especially for strings. For example, instead of loading up a sample patch called something like "strings ensemble," load up separate patches for each. That is, violin ensemble, second violin ensemble, viola ensemble, etc. Instead of part writing all voices to the same patch, you can compose them for a separate instrument, clearing up the way for some awesome sounding separation later down the road when you get to the mix stage. Cellos and double basses are iffy--reserve them for intro/interlude/outro type passages, as during the full-on metalness you've already got drums, bass, and guitar occupying a lot of low end. \u000a\u000aSecondly, get ahold of some sample packs that are capable of keyswitching. The only really glaring problem I had with your track was the awkward attack whenever a new note began, it can easily end up sounding "keyboard-like." If you have keyswitching capability, you can program different articulations such as sustenuto, fortepiano, sforzando, and tremolo. Having more articulations will allow you to more closely emulate the way real life instruments react with their players, achieving a higher degree of realism. 
p5687
aVOrchestration is somewhat of a dying art now that we don't actually need physical players to play the instruments. In most genres, especially metal like this, just go with whatever instruments sound good to you (try to balance the pitch spectrum evenly between treble middle and bass range instruments). Unless you intend to have it played with an actual orchestra the type/amount of various instruments doesn't matter.\u000a\u000aSounds great by the way, keep it up. Maybe consider using a little less distortion on the guitar sound, you don't need that thick of a sound when you have other instruments backing it up; it might really clear up the mix.

p5708
(lp5709
VIt's not the most important thing in the world to me to have my lyrics rhyme, but it makes them easier for me to remember if they do.  Since I play guitar and do the vocals at the same time, the vocals are the main thing I focus on while performing.  The guitar work is 95% muscle memory and 5% looking at the neck for a position shift more than 3 frets.
p5710
aVBlack metal is mostly prose but I try to aim for something original which is why I go for a bit of poetry. Rhyme is important for creating lyrical flow, but lyricists are too sucked into end rhyme. I have no interest in Dr. Seuss.\u000a\u000aSample of what I think are my best:\u000a\u000aForged in the heart of the *crater*  \u000aThe *creator* looks in **dismay**  \u000aCasts **away** the **mistake**  \u000aTo be **erased** from memory by  \u000a-Time-\u000a \u000a----\u000a\u000aThat nothing really special there. The next quatrain is my personal favorite.\u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000aAs it passes by   \u000aDrenched by the *tears* of the Earth   \u000aThe *seared* **flesh** turns to **ash**   \u000aAs the life begins to end   \u000a\u000a----\u000a\u000aThe song is called Obsidian Heart, it's about cooling lava representing a dying heart, and I think the lines really come together nicely. My choice in words is not just for the sake of rhyme, but if it creates an appropriate sense of imagery and story telling, then I'll take it to the extreme. It's about telling the story and sending the message. I seek rhymes that feel natural. The converse is also true, I won't avoid generic rhyme if they really fit.

aVI usually find that rhyming lyrics sound cheesy and juvenile, to be honest. So I (on the rare, rare occasion I actually write lyrics) try to avoid them.
p5716
aVThere's lyrics that don't rhyme just like there's poems that don't rhyme. Totally depends on the situation. Recently I found some really cool lyrics by Dark Fortress - Venereal Dawn (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l5LGrbH-8k). The lyrics are basically poem.
p5717
aVDon't let this affect what you want to do, but I hate rhyming lyrics in metal, at least simple couplet or ABAB schemes and whatnot. For example I thought Carnifex's new album was really weird just because all of a sudden the vocalist started writing rhyming lyrics. I like good internal rhymes and whatnot, but in metal I'd much rather the vocalist say what he wants to say than force some pop-esque rhyme scheme into his lyrics.

aVYeah, I'm also throwing Rains of Castamere in. Melo-Death style. If you could knock something out for me by Wednesday at the latest, that would be great haha. The end of the song will go back to Game of Thrones theme. I'm performing in a talent show on Saturday, and I need to have everything done before Friday. So, just to recap,  the song structure is Game of Thrones, Rains of Castamere twice (first time slow), and Game of Thrones again.

aVThanks dude!\u000aI don't usually think about it, but honestly my process is kind of all over the place from song to song. \u000a\u000aI usually start out with a collection of random riffs that I liked enough to jot down in Guitar Pro at some point, and I'll either develop them individually or try and come up with creative ways of piecing them together. Usually by means dicking around with a guitar until I like what comes out, adding drum and bass parts along the way.\u000a\u000aOnce I feel like I have a full songs worth of material I record it, and then often end up completely rewriting certain parts if they don't sound as cool in real life as I thought they did in Guitar Pro.

VGreat effort! What tuning is this in?
p5745
aVIt's E standard.
p5746
aVIt's not bad man. The acoustic section for the first and second verse is way off though? I'm not sure if you're doing that for effect, but it sounds like you're an entire 8th note off all the way through. There's an easier way to play that little Bb shape at the end of the verse phrase, too:\u000a\u000a    e|------------------------------------------------------------------|\u000a    B|----------------------------------------------------------3-------|\u000a    G|-------------0---------------0---------------0--------2/3---0-2h3-|\u000a    D|-----4-----4---4-----4-----4---4-----4-----4--------0-------------|\u000a    A|---2-----2---------2-----2---------2-----2------1-----------------|\u000a    E|-0-----3---------0-----3---------0-----3--------------------------|\u000a\u000a\u000aThis way you can stay in the same position for the whole thing. On the last rep before the chorus kicks in, instead of sliding down to 1st fret, slide that last shape up to 6th fret low E string and hammer on the chord:\u000a\u000a    D|-7-|\u000a    A|-5-|\u000a    E|-6-|\u000a\u000a\u000aIt sounds like you are missing some stuff here and there (some chords, phrasing, etc.) Did you learn it by ear or via tab? That acoustic section right before the solo is good though. That's a weird 15/16 phrase isn't it? Solo was pretty good too (a tad out of tune.)\u000a\u000aI think it may be better if you turned down the volume of the actual track a bit and your guitar up a bit (not much, maybe +2dB)
p5747
aVOne big mistake I can clearly account for is when I went into the strumming pattern. I knew I fucked up a bit going into it, but by that point I got kind of tired hearing the song for the millionth time, so I just decided to keep it as it is. I probably should've put 'For entertainment purposes only' being that it's not entirely 100% accurate. Then again, mistakes are a part of life, I use my channel mostly as motivation to get better, as well as really develop a feeling when it comes to song structure, composition etc. As for the first acoustic interlude, I'm not entirely sure who's correct, being that Everytime I heard It I swore that what I was hearing was relevant to what I was playing. By the way, do you have a Youtube channel? I'D definitely be interested in seeing some of your videos if you do. 
p5748
aVNeedless to say, judging by your profile (pardon my trolling), you seem like an intelligent dude who I could learn a lot from. I, myself, need to delve into more theory, as well as Audio Engineering. I absolutely love the organic approach, but theres always more to learn.
p5749
aVI hear ya. Recording music can be tiring. Usually when I record a song, I have to put it away for a week before I can listen to it at all. Just get so sick of it from practicing it then recording it.\u000a\u000aI don't mean the acoustic interlude, I mean the part where he sings "Kept warm, by the light of the lantern,..." etc. The verses. If you look at the first verse, your picking is almost an entire 8th note out. The second verse is a bit better but still out. By the time it gets to the verse riff before the interlude kicks in, it seems to be OK. Rhythm wise it is OK, it almost just looks like you accidentally offset the audio/video clip for the verses too far forward.\u000a\u000aDon't have a YouTube account, no, sorry. I've thought about making one but have never gotten around to it. I have a few things up on SoundCloud if you want to check it out: https://soundcloud.com/GSGuitar -- There are a couple snippets of some Opeth stuff there, but they are kind of sloppy and mostly just done as a tone test than an actual proper recording. I'd like to record a cover of Ghost of Perdition into Baying of the Hounds in one take, those are two of my favourite songs. Also Harlequin Forest is great fun to play. I recorded a cover of Wreath from the Deliverance album years ago with a friend of mine but I would consider it pretty garbage by my current standards so I doubt I'd ever release it.

p5753
(lp5754
VThe mix is not great, unless that weird hollow guitar and distant drum sound was what you were going for. The intro felt like it was going somewhere, but due to the strange mixing of the parts that came after, the energy and flow of the song really felt like it dropped off after the 15 second mark. Composition-wise its hard to judge without a better mix. The first thing I would work on is the guitar tone, then the mixing.
p5755
aVYeah I'm using Audacity, mic to amp. I need a virtual set up, seems like the best tones come from those. Here's the updated version, I still have a lot of work to do https://soundcloud.com/shane-arbitrary/deus-est-mortuus-demo
p5756
aVVirtual setups do not provide the "best tones". However, they do provide pretty good tones for the money and are great writing tools for startups such as yourself. The best tones will always come from a good player + a good guitar + a good amp/cab + a good room + a good mic(s) + a good pre-amp + a good AD/DA converter + a good engineer.
p5757
aVI understand that, I worked with the mixing a little bit more and I'm a lot more confident in the final product. The hollow sound gives the song a grim atmosphere and what I was going for but the mix made it sound bad. Let me know what you think of this https://soundcloud.com/shane-arbitrary/arbitrary-horizon-deus-est-mortuusfinal-remaster\u000a\u000aEdit: I also have a very low end set up, my guitar sounds good though with a bit of tweaking.

aVQuad tracking, learned from a tutorial on Youtube haha. I'm not much of an audio engineer at all.

aVIf that's quad-tracked, you've got some major phasing issues going on. There are number of ways to fix this (the "right" way is to catch it during the tracking phase) but every DAW has a different way to handle this. I can only comment on Pro Tools unfortunately.

asVCheap Peavey -guitar- for metal? sound OK?
p5801
(lp5802
VI think the pups are probably the single biggest factor in tone, but the rest of the guitar does make a difference. I have moved a pup from guitar to guitar and they sounded different,  even though the were using the exact same pup. 
p5803
aVI wouldn't say $500 is cheap. For 500 you could get a lot better of a guitar IMO. I'm not impressed at all by the tone really.
p5804
aVThere are 5 main blocks when it comes to guitar playing which form tone.\u000a\u000a1) Guitar Wood\u000a\u000a2) Pick Ups\u000a\u000a3) Amp\u000a\u000a4) Amp Settings\u000a\u000a5) Technique\u000a\u000a1 and 5 usually being the most important. \u000a\u000aFor example, you could get John Petrucci's Music Man, his Boogie set up and pedalboard but you probably won't sound like him unless you're able to emulate his phrasing, his style of play.\u000a\u000aIf you know what you/producer knows what they're doing you can make most things sound half-decent.\u000a\u000aWith that being said, that Peavey doesn't really sound TOO bad. Although I'm not a big fan of EMG, I have one guitar which has a set of HZs in them. I prefer my scatterwounds. \u000a
p5805
aVWhat pick ups are those? They look and sound like emg's. Sounds fine, I was just reading Chris Letchford of [Scale the Summit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfEpaGTPCZY) talking about how pick ups are the only important part of the guitar and they're where all your tone comes from. He's working on a new Jazz album and using the same set of EMG's he uses in his work with Scale the Summit. I don't know where I really stand on that option, but he's clearly a much better guitarist than me &amp; has many more years under his belt. 
p5806
aVI would answer that by saying there's a very good reason that most players don't buy cheap-ass copies and throw a set of upmarket pups in there. I could list all the different parts of a guitar that are responsible for subtle nuances in tone, but I'll just point out the screamingly obvious: rosewood vs lacquered maple fretboard. Worlds apart for me.
p5807
aVHe said "Its all about the pickups, so you can get the cheapest possible guitar as long as it has a nice set of pickups in it." \u000a\u000aIt's been bugging me so much, I really look up to the guy. Still I just have to disagree with that on so many levels. Still not like I have to believe everything I hear, I just feel that he know so much more about music than me and I've been hung up on that for days now. \u000a\u000aThanks for getting my head clear again! 
p5808
aVI'm a fan of the band, for sure, but I vehemently disagree with the dude on this point. I wonder what made him think that... Tone differences aside, I really don't believe that even the best set-up cheap Vietnamese model would be anywhere near as easy to play as a nice Japanese model with a respectable setup.
p5809
aVDo you have empirical evidence or is that personal superstition though?
p5810
aVSure. Pick up a Fender Strat with a lacquered maple neck, then pick up a Fender Strat of the same series with a rosewood neck. Keep the amp settings the same, and tell me if you don't notice a difference, especially on a clean setting. \u000aYou could also try maybe a light guitar like an Ibanez vs a heavy guitar like a Yamaha SG or a Les Paul. \u000aAnd these are just the really obvious tone differences, there's a whole bunch of stuff that makes more subtle differences to the output tone. \u000aSource for clarification: worked in the biggest guitar store in the UK for 3 years, I've probably played a couple of thousand different guitars.
p5811
aVI get what you're saying, but, I think it would need to be tested blind and with a control.\u000a\u000aYou'd need a robot arm to play the guitar exactly the same and stuff, the actual exact pups and wiring switched between guitars. Same pickup height from strings too and so on.\u000a\u000aI know I for one actually play differently depending on how the guitar feels too.
p5812
aVIt's not actually using those pickups.\u000a\u000aIt's a piezo bridge, picks up the strings individually then pitch shifts them, emulates a pickup sound and sends it out.\u000a\u000aThe guitar's strings are actually tuned a half step up from normal.
p5813
aVYou -can- use the pups, but I'm not in this example. Just to be clear in case I sounded insane.
p5814
aVThey sound really cool, I'll have to look into them. 
p5815
aVThat's absolutely false in so many ways. So much of the tone comes from the woods. \u000a\u000aA mahogany guitar is going to sound very different than a maple or ash guitar to anyone who has been playing guitar longer than four years. \u000a\u000aAlso pickups aren't the only thing to do with sustain. If your intonation, neck-joint, really anything can mess up your sustain, and it's incredibly noticeable unless you never do bends. \u000a\u000aPickups contribute a lot to tone, but the quality of the guitar *does* show. \u000a\u000aEDIT: Finally got to watch the video. The tone was a pretty generic modern tone, although it was a bit dry, from what I could hear, and it was also pretty produced, so you can't get the sound of the actual guitar without the compression, EQ, and whatever other effects.
p5816
aVI agree, It's just I really looked up to this guy, I know end of the day he's a much better guitarist than me. I don't know why I even let myself think something like that. \u000a\u000aI have a friend how had a schecter Hell raiser that had the same pick ups as one of my Ibanez and they had a night and day difference. Well, duh one was made of basswood and the other was mahogany. \u000a\u000aI enjoy Chris's tone in Scale the Summit. Still in the past I've always thought that EMG kinda sucked and had a very generic tone. Thanks for your time. You have no clue how stupid I feel for thinking that way. It's just I really looked up to that guy, and I tend to be kinda foolish when I hear someone I look up to say something about music. Thanks for your time! 
p5817
aVHey don't worry about it man, I didn't intend to sound condescending, if it seemed like that. I have a tendency to. I understand when someone says stuff about music we have a tendency to take things too close to heart, s'all good brother.

p5824
aVShipping would be insane on a 6505+ combo. It would be better to look for one locally.
p5825
aVYou can get a brand new one on ebay shipped to anywhere in the US for $515 total. I know it's slightly over OPs original post but would definitely fit the bill
p5826
aVI came here to suggest this. And later on you can also throw a 4x12 underneath it for an even better effect. Better speakers and plenty of volume. I've been running such a rig for a year or so now.  My old amp died before a gig and I needed something fast and cheap. It's treated me well.
p5827
aVI'd like to add to this. I have this amp(bought it for myself for Xmas) with a TS-9 tube screamer and this amp fucking rips but it's noisy as shit. I put a ISP Decimator in line and a bullshit Behringer noise suppressor in the loop to get it quiet. I'll be upgrading the behringer for a Boss NS-2 in the near future. But, yes, this amp is as noisey as the reviews say it is... But it sounds fucking dope. 
p5828
aVI have the NS-2 doing the 4-cable method and it is very good... I'd look at getting rid of both the ISP and the behringer and getting the ISP Decimator G String and using that with the 4-cabe method if I were you
p5829
aVThat's a good idea now that I've played with the stuff personally instead of watching YouTube reviews. I got the Decimator last weekend at Guitar Center. The guy told me that they don't stock the G-String and it would have to be special ordered(why would I do that when I could order it online without going to them?) and that the Decimator by itself would suffice. For some of the reviewers, it seemed like it worked well but this won't cut it for me. My stupid ass didn't even realize that the NS-2 had a 4 cable method until you brought it up. None of the videos I watched featured that and I'm thoroughly hating myself for it.\u000a\u000aDo you have experience with the G String? The NS-2 is $100 and the Decimator was $140 meanwhile the G String is $240. Is the G String worth the extra cash? I've read that instead of it acting as two independent gates, it times the gate in the loop to the input signal for more accuracy. Maybe the NS-2 does that as well?
p5830
aVI've seen the G string on ebay new for $160-180 before, and cheaper second hand. The NS-2 will fit your needs perfectly however it does affect your tone a bit (I like the way it does, slightly compresses and tightens it). The NS-2 works very well as a gate (good for chugging), where the ISP is better for reducing hiss without touching your sound too much.\u000a\u000aAs I said I use the NS-2 and I'm very happy... I moved on from my 5150 though and have an AXE FX 2 now with internal gates so never upgraded to the ISP. I have used the G string with my amp in the past when I borrowed it off another guitarist and didn't notice a huge difference to be honest. Also you should be able to pick up an NS-2 online much cheaper than $100
p5831
aVNot into metalcore but I'd say http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007KZQNEK/ref=mp_s_a_1_8/176-0501532-1583913?qid=1420516565&amp;sr=8-8&amp;pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70 is a good bet. Bugera gets bad rep because of reliability. I had mine replaced and it's still working after three years YMMV great sound for a small price
p5832
aVHoly shit. I'm in love/hard!
p5833
aVThe Bugera 6262 is very similar to the Peavey 5150/6505 which is used by the majority of Metalcore bands. Or as I mentioned in another post you can buy a small 6505 combo for under $500
p5834
aVAre virtual amps something you have considered or are were you trying to stick with finite gear? I am able to achieve [This sound](http://youtu.be/FnTsy9WYhkI?list=UUEFOo_b3XZxKmIoZvoAf-HA) using virtual amps, which i am happy with, which all of which i use are free. The only thing you need to spend money on is some form of audio interface (mine was 100), and a decent DAW which you can pay for or pirate (i brought mixcraft 6 for around 80 and the features it have are more than worth it and plenty), and then downloading some free ampsims and cabinets online, which i use Poulin Legion as an amp sim.
p5835
aVI considered virtual amps before, but started thinking what would I do if I had to preform live with my band. I figured it would be better to do it with physical amps so that I can preform live, record, and really control and mess around with it.  I have logic pro x, but the pedals and guitar stuff are shit. Either the noise surpresser and eq are shit or I'm just not using them right (any note past the high E 12th fret cuts out like a cd skipping). What are the free amp softwares you use?

aVBuy this: http://tech21nyc.shptron.com/p/sansamp-character-series-oxford\u000a\u000aIt's an amp sim in a box. You don't need to go into a computer or get an interface or anything, just go straight from this into a speaker/PA for live use, or a studio monitor for home use. Since you do have some money to spend I don't see the point in resorting to pirating or free plugins when you can get something really nice and still be well under budget.\u000a\u000aMy current home setup is a Tech21 Character Blonde into a single Yamaha HS8 monitor and the sound is fantastic.

aVI was always under the impression that line 6 was commonly used. Scoop your mids, get EMGs if you don't already have them. That's as important as your type of amp

aVLook for a used 6505+ 112 combo or a 5150 combo on craigslist. Then find some sort of overdrive pedal and go to town.
p5842
aVYour mileage may vary (I live in the midwest and can work on amps), but I got a well-worn 5150 with no power tubes for $350, an empty tallboy Peavey 4-12" for $20, power tubes and Jensen P12N speakers salvaged from a couple old organs.  My guitarist who owns a dual recto and 1960 that's half V30s/half GT75s really likes my rig, regardless of how bad it looks.

aVThe guitarist in my old metalcore band used a crate combo, that sounded pretty good.

Vscales and a metronome. \u000a\u000aMake sure you aren't cheating by missing notes, only increase the speed when you can hit every note clean, if you can't back the speed off a bit.\u000a\u000aI'm not really a shredder but this did wonders for my speed when I was just starting.
p5848
aVAbsolutely this. I skipped doing this the first time I heard this tip but as soon as I started doing it I noticed a huge boosted in how efficiently I could skip between strings at a fast speed. Also the amount of scales I memoried through doing it helped me so much in song writing. If there's one tip I would share to get shredding down its to stick through the boring, time scrutinous exercises and realise that two years down the line you are gonna be thanking yourself.
p5849
aVI think my only story and advice is play it slow then play it faster and then play it faster still. I tend to play too fast on stage because of nervous energy so maybe it might help to play a few gigs?
p5850
aVI will second using a metronome and practicing scales. But you have to do more than that. Running up and down scales back and forth will only make you good at that shape. You need to be able to recall any interval in any key, so get good at alternate picking some weirder ones like fourth's and sixth's. Focus on clarity over speed for now. Put the metronome on something moderate and turn the gain down. When you're playing each note, pay attention to all of the qualities of the note. Is it buzzing at all? Does it extend until the end of that beat and stop only when the next note is played?  Are they all in a uniform volume?\u000a\u000aAlso don't neglect chromatic excersizes.\u000a\u000a0-1-0-1-0-1-0-1-0-2-0-2-0-2-0-2-0-3-0-3-0-3-0-3-0-4-0-4-0-4-0-4-\u000a\u000aDo this on each string up and down, make sure your fingers are spread out but not flat, rather, curled, so that your fingers come down on top of the space where they need to be. Practice all of your exercises like that. Your scales, scale fragments, difficult passages, arpeggios (not the sweeps, you may need to be flat sometimes for that) and any other wack and crack you can think of to practice.
p5851
aVPlay without distortion. It can cover a lot of mistakes and sloppy playing 
p5852
aVCouple of things divided into fun and not fun categories.\u000a\u000aFun:\u000a\u000aLearn a difficult song. This will usually force you to get fast and alternate picking down but with the more technical music, your left hand will get a good work out as well. I like Opeth for this. Very confusing for my left hand.\u000a\u000aJust learn a solo and go over it with a Metronome until every note is clean. You may not be skilled enough to learn that solo, but you'll be amazed at how the practice translates into other facets of your playing.\u000a\u000aLearn a relatively long but easy solo. This is more for getting used to doing long runs instead of a quick 2 second lick. I remember the solo from Iron Man being really good for that.\u000a\u000aNot Fun: \u000a\u000aGet scales and run through them with a metronome until every note is clean. When it's clean, bump up the BPM.\u000a\u000aGoogle guitar warm ups and find the warm ups that confuse your fingers. It doesn't have to sound melodic. This is all about wiring your brain to  get used to atypical patterns.\u000a\u000aFind a repeating pattern or riff and play it over and over with a metronome. Something with alternate picking is preferred. \u000a\u000a*Edit: if you don't know what alternate picking is, that's really important.
p5853
aVI feel like I improved a lot by writing drum tracks in FL Studio and then playing along and recording to them, either starting with a riff and writing a drum track to it or writing a drum line (specifically kick drum) and matching it with my playing.

aVCome up with a lick and move it in sequence up or down modally, probably in minor to start so you can be comfortable and not as bored with just playing up and down the scale.

aVSpeed mechanics for lead guitar by troy stetina.\u000aA lot of people will hate on technique, but realize that his style is not the 'buckethead/petrucci' style.\u000aYou will hit a wall, when it comes to speed, if your technique is wrong. \u000aLeft hand: make sure your thumb is underneath your fingers and centered. Also, learn to use a 4 fret position. 1Index, 2middle, 3ring, 4pinky. Then learn to position shift between the 7 scale variations. Never have any fretting finger farther away from the strings than is absolutely necessary. \u000aRight hand: never have your fingers extended. Make the shape like you are finger picking, close the hand, And rest those fingers on the higher strings when playing E, D, or A strings. Do the reverse when playing G, B, or E strings. Rest your palm on the lower strings. \u000aMake sure you aren't playing with too much pick exposed, And make sure it's aligned parallel to the strings for max articulation. Pick with your elbow and not your wrist.
p5856
aV&gt;Pick with your elbow and not with your wrist\u000a\u000aYou're supposed to pick with your wrist
p5857
aVCare to elaborate on why?\u000aPlease, go watch jeff loomis play, and see how much his entire forearm moves.  Yes, there is wrist movement.   But the driving force is the elbow. 
p5858
aVYou can still move your elbow when playing, but the actual picking motion is done with the wrist because it is a lot easier and a lot more accurate. 
p5859
aVThis is a ridiculous claim.  You use both styles when playing.  However, when full on shredding (which is what OP is alluding to) tremelo picking is used -&gt; elbow. \u000aEither you don't play fast enough.  Or you have some kind of magic wrist my friend. \u000ahttp://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/archive/index.php?t-1299874.html
p5860
aVI see. I guess I have a magic wrist then because I can play really fast without my elbow. I was always taught to use my wrist, and that is the popular belief. But if it is easier to use your elbow, then by all means use your elbow. 
p5861
aVThis is horribly wrong. It's a kind of thing you will misinterpret if you just watch someone and not feel for it. You must use your wrist to alternate pick. Carelessly fast tremolo picking can be done with the arm too, but it can be done just as well or better with the wrist.

p5868
(lp5869
VPrice? \u000a\u000aThis isn't the 'only' piece that was dimebags tone. It also had a lot to do with using a higher wattage solid state amp, the blue box MXR 6 band EQ and Bill Lawrence XL-500's. 
p5870
aVIndeed.\u000a\u000aI think the RG100 preamp is much more important to getting his tone - if you don't have that I can't see the EQ helping much.\u000a\u000aIn saying that, could be interested - price depending.
p5871
aVI own a first run Krankenstein - it can be done with tubes too. It's all in the eq's. 
p5872
aVWould you mind sharing your EQ settings, because I can't get my second run Krankenstein to sound a fucking thing like the RG...serious question, not taking the piss.
p5873
aVThe first run is a bit different. \u000a\u000aThe way I get there is with two EQ's and the use of the loop. One EQ (6 band) up front boosting the mids and then one eq in the loop actually scooping them (a 10 band). then i play with the sweep on the front and make sure the pot is pulled on the efx loop boost. \u000a\u000aSo many people wrote off the Krankenstein because they didn't understand how to use an EFX loop. I get pretty much spot on with that. 
p5874
aVCheers, I see you're pretty much running the same way Dime did.\u000a\u000aI've only got a 6-band at the moment, so may try getting the second EQ and see what that does.  Also mine is the 20w Jr into the Krank single 12" (or a Blackstar 4x8")  which I don't think is helping.  I'm thinking a 212 or 412 with V30s may help also.\u000a\u000aI don't really want Dime's tone as my tone, but I like playing Pantera songs and it would be nice to be able to achieve a similar tone for that stuff.

VI do the same thing. I've thought about the whole live show thing, I think it would be rather difficult to do well. \u000a\u000aThat said, if I wanted to keep it interesting, I would try and change instruments and show off the playability of a little bit of all of it. 
p5901
aVThis is also another option I thought of. I can sing and play guitar simultaneously and sing and drum(still learning though) simultaneously as well. \u000a\u000aPerhaps that incorporated into something theatrical? Maybe a story I depict with audible(the music) and visual aspects. 
p5902
aV&gt; Perhaps that incorporated into something theatrical? Maybe a story I depict with audible(the music) and visual aspects.\u000a\u000aHonestly, I don't think you need to do anything special if you're good musically.  I think you run the risk of it coming off as cheesy if it's too overdone so simplicity would be the key.\u000a\u000aSolo playing lends itself a bit better towards shreddy, Satriani/Vai/Malmsteem type stuff in my opinion but I don't think that it needs to be all 'diddly-diddly' your whole set, especially if you're singing.\u000a\u000a&gt;I'm aware people go to concerts to SEE the band play...\u000a\u000aI don't think this is the case all the time.  I'm not only there to hear/see bands, I'm there to drink some beers, meet people, fail at getting laid, and at the risk of being cliche, the atmosphere.  I mean, I've seen plenty of local bands that were awesome but were really just four dudes standing in the same spot headbanging away.  They didn't really offer anything visually besides a mass of hair and denim but fuck it, music was good.  The other thing to remember is you're going to start by playing small local shows, people paying $5-10 to get in aren't expecting pyrotechnics or Metallica S&amp;M.  And chances are, you'll find people at those shows who will want to jam, if that's the route you want to take.\u000a\u000aI think if you go up there, not as a guitarist and singer but as a performer it can work.  Be animated, have a good time, do your thing well and fucking own that shit.
p5903
aVIt's a bit of a myth, really.  Some bands, you go for the visuals.  Things like GWAR, KISS, or any band that you know are going to have pyro or lasers or something.\u000a\u000aBut there are plenty of successful bands who don't do anything but play.  Chevelle, Staind, Tool all come to mind immediately.  Even the White Stripes.  Actually, every 2-piece I can think of.\u000a\u000aPeople go to shows for the experience.  So make your show an experience.  Even if that just means experiencing the music.\u000a\u000aAlso, you could get a projector and have something playing on the wall behind you. :)
p5904
aVYeah! I was thinking about projecting something but not sure what it would be. \u000a\u000aPerhaps screens of me playing the rest of the instruments? It sounds cool in theory but I'm not sure how entertaining that would be hahah 
p5905
aVI think that would actually be a little cheesy, but maybe if you do it well.\u000a\u000aOr you could go full cheese and talk to your other selves in between songs lol
p5906
aVHahahah oh gosh. \u000a\u000aDim the lights completely so no one can see my face while I talk to myself in different voices...I think I'd scare people away lol
p5907
aVThat could definitely work, or it could completely bomb. But then that goes for most everything, you should definitely consider it! I've never seen such a thing in a musical act, and being unique is definitely one way to get traction.
p5908
aVThis is true. I really won't know until I try!
p5909
aVI'm in the same boat as you. I collab with some people here in this sub to get my music made, but if I were to go on stage, it'd just be me. And I've never played on stage with a band, let alone by myself. 
p5910
aVYeah that sounds about right! I'm still working on getting my music up here though. I really didn't expect this much help from this post! 
p5911
aVMy personal opinion is that live metal should be a full band for 'real' shows, even if the project is a one-man deal. But don't let me bring you down as it's just my perspective on live performance. \u000a\u000a\u000aSome ideas: \u000a\u000a\u000a- Incorporate some visuals if you're capable and if that's your thing. I don't know if you're familiar with Pretty Lights (some kind of electronic genre), but the guy used to just be onstage by himself with a laptop. He used a lot of lighting and some visualizations on a screen to keep it more interesting (as do most electronic musicians it seems). \u000a\u000a\u000a- Be charismatic. The hardest part about being alone will be the fact that *you're alone*. This means that the audience's attention will be on you 100% of the time rather than being distributed amongst your bandmates. [Devin Townsend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nubJjB95VdY) is a good example of being able to carry an audience by himself (though he still uses a full band normally). \u000a\u000a\u000a- Engage the audience. This is part of having charisma, but be sure to pay attention to the audience and not get lost focusing on yourself. Maybe have them clap a long or "Hey!" along if you can get them too. Anything that makes it feel like they didn't just stumble into your bedroom rehearsal where you haven't noticed them. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a- If you can, maybe go for a more non-traditional stage setup. Rather than having you on the stage on one side of the room and a wall of people on the other, try putting your setup so you and your stool or whatever are in the middle of everyone with a circle of people around. Stuff like this will diminish the gap between you and the audience both physically and psychologically. \u000a\u000a\u000aAnyway, that's about all I can think of. And most of it is a lot easier said than done. \u000a  
p5912
aV&gt;Devin Townsend\u000a\u000aIs that... christmas bells in the background? Haha, that was... fun, but way too cheesy. And he seems like a complete douchebag. Not sure why anyone would want to watch that live.
p5913
aVYou mean the synth? \u000a\u000a\u000aAnd Devin is the exact opposite of a douchebag. Really considerate, hilarious guy that doesn't get caught up in all the bullshit of metal and the entertainment industry. Though he embraces cheesiness on a lot of stuff, he's incredibly diverse from [heavy stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeG-6bpeUkA) (and much heavier), to [rock stuff](http://youtu.be/rvnOvUy78cI?t=1m22s) to [softer stuff](http://youtu.be/3iuwY4s7AuY?t=6s) to [really mellow](http://youtu.be/qHVnebR7s5A?t=54s) stuff. 
p5914
aVI saw him live opening for BTBAM once and it was literally the craziest live show I've ever seen. This guy is a monster, I didn't even know he existed until then and I definitely wanted more after. Incredibly unique on stage, very humble off stage.
p5915
aVSome people pull it off- people show up to see Brendon Small perform his shit live and he just turns on his computer, plays along to his own songs, and keeps it interesting by cracking jokes in between playing stuff. Sometimes he hires people to perform the other guitar parts/drums live just for the show, but you don't have to do that- just wanted to put that out there. 
p5916
aVBrendon Small is probably my biggest influence for this goal of mine. \u000aHe's got something that sets himself aside, and so that's what I want to figure out for myself.
p5917
aVI feel you. I fucking love the man- he's my guitar and metal idol. I'm getting one of his signature guitars this summer and I'm going to put it in C Standard so that I can play all of his shit. 
p5918
aV....is it the snow falcon? 
p5919
aVNope, Epi Thunderhorse. I'd get the Gibson one, but I can't afford that shit and the Epi is nearly identical in every way. \u000a\u000aI'd love a Snow Falcon, but I love the Explorer shape over all other guitar shapes and want a nice one first. 
p5920
aVI agree completely. There's just something about the explorer that is just so marvelous. So I had to get one too!
p5921
aVI'm so glad that Small made that one of his signatures, and that the Epi is so great for the price. Makes my life easier.
p5922
aVI'm not sure what year my explorer is but it looks like this http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Explorer/Gibson-USA/Explorer/Features.aspx\u000a\u000aAnd recently I played on one of the Thunderhorse guitars and I was BLOWN AWAY at how much I loved playing it. I like it probably just as much as the gibson.
p5923
aVI'm glad to hear that. The Epiphone on paper sounds amazing but I've only been able to play the Gibson and I'm taking as chance on it. 
p5924
aVYou definitely will NOT be disappointed.
p5925
aVI was in one band where the lead guitarist wrote all the parts. Everyone else (including myself) just pretty much performed what they wrote. So you could do something like this, just find some people to play with you. \u000a\u000aAnother idea is just go up on stage and perform by yourself. I've also done this. I performed the vocals only and people were rather into it, especially when I came off the stage and joined the pit.
p5926
aVThat's awesome! Was there anything else you did that you think contributed to getting the crowd going? Aside from the quality of the music lol
p5927
aVWell you don't necessarily have to do much\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji6HREv38o4\u000a\u000aHes the only one man band I've seen live that has been impressive. I think the most important thing is to SOUND like a full band. You want your recorded stuff to sound good, you dont want to sound like a guitar+vocals over some random bullshit. Make sure the prerecorded drums and everything sound real and thick.
p5928
aVIn all honesty, don't do that unless your material is truly mindblowing and original. At the very least, get a talented live drummer. A good drummer is so integral to a live performance, especially in metal. If it's just you and a laptop up there, you're probably going to get laughed off the stage (or more likely, zero crowd reaction). You have to think of a live show as a *performance*.\u000a\u000aI don't want to discourage you from trying new things though and I haven't heard your music to be a fair enough judge. But you gotta put yourself into the shoes of a metalhead audience and what the expectations are for people who pay money to see live shows. Even the slowest, doomiest performances can be high-energy in their own way. A dude standing up there with a guitar and a laptop doesn't exactly get me excited, nor does it sound worth the money/drive to see. \u000a\u000aBrendon Small gets away with it because he's a one-of-a-kind artist and he's already made himself semi-famous for his work in a lot of other popular, widely-known projects. He has a pretty big fanbase to allow him to perform solo. Startup artists such as yourself are starting from nothing and first impressions are pretty damn important. Don't blow it; be patient and wait until the timing, gear, personnel, and performance is ready. It will pay off in the long run if you take it slow and do it right.

My car is where I listen to music and that is where everyone else is going to be hearing it as well.\u000a\u000aAn interesting article regarding loudness and the over-compression of modern metal:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep11/articles/loudness.htm\u000a

aVwaw he's incredibly fast!
p5945
aVCreeping Death is actually one of the songs that I practice every time. I'm gonna have to give that Slayer song a shot, though. I probably also should have added that I recently got a longer strap so I could have my guitar hang lower. I've caught myself using my shoulder and arm a lot when I pick fast and I've always been told that's a bad thing. So I figured by hanging my guitar lower, I could keep my arm straighter and force myself to only use my wrist as a result.
p5946
aV[deleted]
p5947
aVI also practice Enter Sandman. Not for speed, obviously, but because it's a good tool for working on picking consistency, e.g. to make extended chords have as much chunk as palm mutes.\u000a\u000aEdit: Sometimes I can't grammar when I'm high.
p5948
aVA lot of people recommend practicing uppicking as fast as possible. Personally, I never found it to be as effective as just practicing downpicking. Start slow with something like Disposable Heroes (the main verse riff has alternate picking patterns thrown in too, but it gets brutal on the right hand). Once songs around that speed become comfortable, move on to faster and faster songs. Also, if you're ever just bored and watching tv or something, grab your guitar and just practice picking. It really only takes one hand, so you could be doing tons of other fun activities with your free hand! Tl;dr Practice up picking, down picking, and jam to some thrash. That should bring you up to speed in no time. 
p5949
aVI also use Metallica songs as exercises for downpicking. My go-tos are Master of Puppets and Blackened. 
p5950
aVJust slowly down pick and progressively get faster
p5951
aVA lot of good advice here, but they forgot one thing. Metronomes really do help with your speed. Always practice with one. 
p5952
aVIf you have at least two guitars, put the heaviest gauge strings it can handle on your practice instrument, leaving your recording/concert instrument how you normally prefer it. \u000a\u000aIf you have a DAW or some other software that can do time compression/expansion independently of pitch, load songs you want to learn into it and increase their tempo by 1/3 (if the song isn't already breakneck speed). \u000a\u000aWhen you go back to normal speed and string gauge, everything will be a lot more manageable.\u000a\u000aPractice to a metronome.\u000a\u000aAlso keep in mind that it's not all about down-picking\u2014the notion that down-picking is superior is both false and irrelevant. Think of downstrokes and upstrokes as analogous to a drummer's left and right hand. Picking patterns are always contextual\u2014when you're soloing or doing rhythm work that branches off from straight 4/4 time, very rarely will straight down-picking, straight up-picking, or straight alt-picking be ideal. Patterns need to be figured out and have a pre-meditated strategy implemented to be very effective, just as a drummer will rarely use a straight LLLLL\u2013, RRRR\u2013, or RLRL\u2013 pattern to execute a perfect lick or fill.
p5953
aVNo, I understand that there are picking techniques, and I use them all a fair amount. I just wanted to work on improving that one particular aspect of picking as a whole.
p5954
asVStill trying to figure out this whole mixing/mastering thing. Looking for some pointers on my latest demo song.
p5955
(lp5956
VNot sure what drum software you're using, but I'd turn up the velocity on the snare. If it was a real drummer, it sounds like he's barely hitting the snare. Gotta smack that bastard.\u000a\u000aOther than that, the mix is pretty full and sounds heavy. Good work!
p5957
aVI think the bass tone in the beginning is a little too bassy. Since it's the only instrument playing for the first third of the song, i think it should be slightly more distorted or gravely in the mids / high mids to texture the sound more and make it a little more interesting [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgeGwAeecAE#t=56). Also it would make the part where the guitars and drums come in less abrupt and flow better.\u000a\u000aFor adding a distorted texture to the bass, you could send the clean signal to a second channel and add guitar amps to distort it and cut the low frequencies [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mol6awk_aDo#t=79).\u000a\u000aI think the guitar tones sound awesome and agree with the comment about the drums lacking some punch. so far sounding like a great mix!
p5958
aVThe drums are lacking attention to detail.  They sound whipped out in a couple minutes and forgotten.  You got a great guitar tone, now you need to bring the drums up to that level.  Good luck, I find drums are by far the hardest part to get right in any metal mix.

p5997
aVI don't live anywhere near Cali, but I do remember having to go through similar ticket selling bullshit with my last band. Do you guys have a ticket quota that you have to meet to play? My band played with Emmure at one point and we had to sell like 20 or 30 tickets in order to play the show, it was rough. Goodluck.
p5998
aVWe've had to sell a quota  before but it was only 30 and the tickets were $10. This time they want us to sell 50 and they are $15
p5999
aVSorry about the pay 2 play.  I think this shit needs to go away, but probably never will unless there's a huge upswing in metal popularity. 
p6000
aVYea it's a shitty way to do business but we want all the exposure e can get especially since the new owner owns another very popular venue know the area that a lot of big bands play at.
p6001
aVI never liked trying to hustle tickets. It sucks when your buddies are like, yeah we dig your music, but we have already seen you play 4 times... 
p6002
aVFuck this pay to play stuff. This is a predatory move on the promoter's part as far as I'm concerned. They count on the small timer's being starstruck enough to agree to that crap. These people want your band to pay $750 to play a show? Are you going to see any of that money? It's just a way of them being able to not eat Otep's guarantee. If you're like 99% of bands out there you aren't made of money.  Work hard but also work smart. What do you hope to see as a return on this venture? Exposure?\u000aYou could rent a van and do a 4 or 5 day regional tour for around $750? Shit, for $500 you could get http://www.riotstickers.com tour package. \u000aThis is why we play those tuesday night crap shows, so when the big tour package's come around the promoter's turn around and scratch your back too.\u000aI've made that mistake before dude, and after the show you get 20 new likes on facebook or whatever, it has yet to be worth it.\u000aLemme know if you're ever in the Raleigh-Durham area and I'll get you on a show, make sure mother fuckers show up and make sure you get paid.  We'd expect the same when we come to your town, that's how this shit works.\u000a\u000atl;dr, fuck pay to play.
p6003
aVYea it's not the first time we've had to do this and it is shitty but the music scene in the surrounding area is basically dead and getting to play with a big band is worth selling some tickets I mean we have like weeks left to sell tickets and we've got 22 of the 50 reserved already with conformed payment. As shitty as it is we think the benefits outweigh the shittiness of the situation. 
p6004
aV&gt; What do you hope to see as a return on this venture? Exposure? You could rent a van and do a 4 or 5 day regional tour for around $750?\u000a\u000aThat is assuming you can (a) get 4 or 5 shows like that, and (b) people will actually show up to them.\u000a\u000aIn my experience, neither of those is trivial. I wouldn't do it myself but there is definitely some potential value in being on these big shows.
p6005
aVDude, I can't agree with you more. I used to do the pay to play thing and it's total bullshit. I joined a band already playing a shit ton of shows back in the day and had to sell tickets for Otep twice. Being the new guy in the band I didn't have any fans to sell to and I just naturally don't have many friends. I had to make up that cost every. Single. Fucking. Time. I have a lot of great memories and played a lot of great shows doing that shit but it was rough. Working 40 hours a week, driving out to Hollywood(an hour away) and trying to sell tickets and work in practice and all that shit just adds up. I've seen promoters try to take band's equipment because they didn't sell all of their tickets. In another instance I remember where the band was short(I don't know by how much) but they kept the money and the band didn't even get to play - a bunch of friends of this band paid to see their friends not play. \u000a\u000aThe band I used to be in still does the pay to play thing occasionally but largely does the model you're speaking about - you get me a show and some heads and I'll do the same for you. It's about the community and the local scene. Don't make these places money, they already have enough. Playing with your favorite bands is dope but how many times does that happen and you don't get to talk or chill with them afterwards anyways?
p6006
aVI personally can't stand Otep, but I just wanted to jump on here and say good luck and I hope you kill it!!\u000a\u000aJust be glad Claude doesn't work there anymore, he was kinda a dick to us when our band played there.
p6007
aVYea we've played there once before and he was an asshole to us. Thanks for the support
p6008
aVClaude was a dick, but he was a pretty good sound guy. his skills began to falter as his health did, which is why he is gone. \u000a\u000adespite the overall shittiness of the boardwalk, the sound was usually the highlight. even the ace of spades, as nice as it is, usually sounds like shit when metal bands play there.
p6009
aVYeah, that's true. I haven't been since he left though, so I can't judge whoever does it now either. I feel you on Ace of Spades though, their only upside is the multiple bars.\u000a\u000aBUT, just cause it's still bothering me and it really pissed me off... I saw Black Dahlia Murder there not that long ago, and I lost my wristband in the pit. I tried to get another one, but they told me I had to go find my old one first... SERIOUSLY?? I went to like 3 different employees / security guards and no one would help me out. It was bullshit, I kept trying to show my ID, that I wasn't trying to scam them or something, and they didn't even care.

p6019
aVThis is awesome. Did I hear some 7/8 timing in there? I was totally grooving to this in my office chair. The tone on that bass is quite clear too! 
p6020
aVSure did! One of the goals for this song was to transfer in and out of time signatures without [throwing off the groove](http://kamidoodles.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/threw-off-my-groove-not-gif.jpg), so there is 4/4, 5/4, 7/8, and then the intro/outro which switches every bar,  11/8 - 14/8 - 11/8 - 18/8. 
p6021
aVGroove was not thrown. Very well done. And those time signatures... that's some straight up Dream Theater stuff. 7/8 and 5/8 are about as exotic as I get with my writing. The end of Arch Enemy's [Hybrids of Steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTq-NwgB5mg) is what made 7/8 really "click" for me in terms of feeling the way it flows. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTq-NwgB5mg#t=168) is the particular part I'm referencing.

p6026
aVThis. Supposedly my music is extreme metal. I don't understand it, but that's what I've been told. And that's exactly what I used.\u000a\u000aNow I've learned there are much better expansions than DFH though...

aVIt's not a "good" one, but I use Guitar Pro 5 with RSE for my solo black metal project.

aVThanks as well.
p6029
aVYou're joking, right ?
p6030
aVWhatever works right? Its really good for writing out drum parts. The quality of sound is low to okay, but I know how to fuck with it in a DAW
p6031
aVThis is experimental... for electro or whatever, I can picture it, but for metal... do you have any example of music you've done this way ? I'm curious now.
p6032
aVIf you're thinking of just the basic MIDI drums, the RSE starting from Guitar Pro 5  actually sounds remotely like real drums. If it was all MIDI sounding that would truly be awful.\u000a\u000a[Here's one of my demo tracks that I consider "done"](http://apathybm.bandcamp.com/track/apathy-demo) (except for single tracked guitar). There's a clean section about 3:00 in where you can hear the drums loud and clear.\u000a\u000aI just got around to adding bass on everything so other songs needs to be remixed which has been a nightmare. \u000a\u000aDisclaimer: Bandcamp automatically reduces the volume of the music you upload, and my music is already mixed to be "Anti-Loudness" so be wary of leaving your volume too high. \u000a\u000aIt doesn't apply to this track but generally the bass drum has issues coming out on blast beats, but this would be solved by tracking it separately from the snare and cymbals. That's too much work for a demo though.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Second track is done too
p6033
aVIt sound actually pretty decent. I'm not at all into black metal, for all I know you guys have weird standards in terms of sound quality, so I guess  I understand why you would want that sound. But I would not use that in my songs.\u000a\u000aDoes GP5 allow wave exports ? Do you have to mix all drums at once ?\u000a\u000aIf that's the song you're looking for, why not, but I don't see how "real" drum softwares won't do better than that. But sure I get that this is a demo and you don't want to spend that much time on it. But I'm sure once you try Superior Drummer for instance, you won't go back to RSE.\u000a\u000aThanks for sharing your music ! 
p6034
aVThanks.\u000a\u000a&gt;I'm not at all into black metal, for all I know you guys have weird standards in terms of sound quality\u000a\u000aFor starters, this is ONLY for demos, I 100% want to have a real drummer for any serious release.\u000a\u000a&gt;Does GP5 allow wave exports ? Do you have to mix all drums at once ?\u000a\u000aIt only exports MIDI. I work around this by capturing my stereo mix using Audacity. I could have separate tracks for Bass, Snare, and cymbal, but that defeats the purpose of using Guitar Pro, which is convenience.\u000a\u000aAs oppose to dedicated drum software, I write all of my music (riffs, bass) in GP and the interface is very convenient for writing a drum track as well. My main reason for using GP is that I don't want to do a lot of work when my music is still in the demo stage. Like all people, I'd rather have a real drummer! Or learn drums myself when I can afford a kit.

aVLooks interesting, and I heard good reviews from AD on multiple occasion. As a Superior Drummer user, I should try it.
p6038
aVI've been using Addictive Drums since I started recording songs and I highly recommend it! One way to use it to get a much more realistic sound is by programming the drums in then turning off all the effects in the program and send each individual output to the DAW, then you can work using what is essentially the raw sample from AD. Works wonders and gives you much more control over it!

aVAwesome stuff man, I especially like the chorus vocals. I don't know much about vocals but I think for that song I've posted, we were sorta looking for something pretty heavy for verse, perhaps akin to Josh from Sylosis or Tim from As I Lay Dying.

I would use the word "pizzazz"... Probably my love of vocals in a slightly higher register but, whatever, I'm being picky just to give you my thoughts.\u000a\u000aIn any case, I loved it. Fantastic piece of work. You have another fan. Thank you for sharing and wishing you and the others good things after the release.

p6100
(lp6101
VNope.\u000a\u000aI run a small DIY label and put my releases up on Bandcamp. The digital version is free whereas obviously the physical one isn't. But with the physical copy you also get the digital one as well as some other extras.\u000a\u000aI do have the downloads set up as a "Pay What You Want" deal so if they want to throw a pound my way that's great but doesn't bother me either way. Music is meant to be heard by everyone, whether they can afford it or not.
p6102
aVI think it kind of comes down to your investment in the music.   I've made demos myself using cheap 4-track recorders, and while they capture some of the spirit of the music, it never sounds professional enough to release it as something I would charge for. As such, my band always spends the cash to go to a studio to be recorded by someone who knows what the fuck they're doing.  On top of that, we're proponents of putting together something cool enough that people will want to purchase a physical copy, so we put out releases with cool, quality packaging as well.  When all is said and done, my two-piece has typically invested thousands in our DIY project, and we need to recoup our costs.   We obviously charge for the physical releases, but I think it's ok to ask fans to chip in a few bucks when an EP took you a fair amount of cash to release it.   As of right now, we're only charging for downloads of our latest release, and our previous release is set to "pay what you want".   Most people will just download the record free, but some folks will still toss you a few bucks, which is important to keep in mind, because the same thing can occur with releases where you have a minimum download cost.   Say, for example, you've got an album available for download on bandcamp that's set to $6.66 or more.  People that really dig your shit will often round that up to an even $10 to show their appreciation.   I know I've personally done this when downloading stuff from bands I love, because I know that playing and recording music can be very expensive, and I want to do what I can to make sure my favorite bands can still afford to release music!
p6103
aVNope, never have done. If people want to pay, that's cool, but I would never force their hand for a download, especially if it's a bedroom project.
p6104
aVI charge a simple $1 for a demo download on my bandcamp page. You can listen to all the songs for free, though. My personal motto, if you want the convenience of having it to play whenever you want, $1 is not that much. We don't even have any physical copies of this demo at the moment, but I would certainly charge more than $1. We play live, just no merch yet at this point in time. \u000a\u000aI'm all for free music, but be aware that, as an artist giving away your stuff for free, you are compromising your marketability, as well as the likelihood of a record label picking you up (they won't want to release recordings that have already been released, even if it is only as a free download). It doesn't seem like this is really your intention though, but I thought it worth noting. 
p6105
aVI always just put all of my music as "Free/PayWhatYouWant" on bandcamp, and one of my beliefs as an artists is that I don't think I would ever want to force people to have to buy my music if they wanted to listen to it.
p6106
aVBecause of how easy it has been to pirate music over the years , people have become entitled when it comes to music.\u000a\u000aNobody thinks they should have to pay for music anymore, and it sucks. It's basically become an unalienable right at this point. \u000a\u000aI think it's still a great idea to put some CD's and stuff out at local places, even if they don't sell well. There are always going to be people who still love CD's, and it will make it easier for other local musicians to hear your stuff.\u000a\u000a
p6107
aVMe and my bandmates play and record purely for fun the last 4 years so take this with a grain of salt but we haven't ever "forced" people to pay for our music on Bandcamp. We just set it to "pay what you want" and are fine with that. The more people that listen to it the better! If we did have any merch we would probably charge for that and make some beer $$ there off our big fans who would be buying that.
p6108
aVYeah i agree with this totally. For our band, so far all the recordings have been done by us so we would feel like we were taking the piss by forcing people to pay for it as it didn't cost us anything to make. Our main goal is to just get as many people listening to us as possible so wouldn't wanna restrict anyone by putting a price tag on it. If people like it enough they may throw a few quid our way and that's great! But we don't expect people to pay £5 for it or anything.

sVExplanation of tube amp heads/solid state, cabinetry and effects pedals.
p6120
(lp6121
VTube/valve and Solid State are very different. A lot of people will say solid state amps sound more "sterile" and lack character and warmth in comparison to valve amps. I prefer the sound of valve amps, but a lot of Metal has been recorded using solid state amps. Wattage is more about headroom than volume, although it does have an effect. a 100 watt valve amp will be far more powerful than a 100 watt solid state amp, which is why you see solid state amps with much higher wattages on much smaller amps. A 5 watt amp being put through a 4x12 and being played at a high volume will sound a lot dirtier than than a 50 watt amp being played through a 2x12 at a loud volume. Although the 4x12 cab is able to produce more volume than a 2x12, the 5 watt can't get that loud and stay clean, whilst a 50 watt amp would do a much better job. Using more than 1 cab will just add more volume to the sound, unless you're using the specific cabs for the speakers in them. You'll see bands using multiple amps in their set up because they'll be switching between them for different tones. People put overdrive pedals in front of their amps to push the valves inside of the amp harder, causing them to saturate easier. In Metal, this usually helps tighten up the bottom end of your guitar tone (when done right) and adds a bit more crunch. You don't need to do this, but if your amp isn't quite as aggressive as you'd like it to be, or the bottom end sounds a bit "flubby", then this can help. It's not a good idea to connect anything directly between the head and the cab, but some amps have an fx loop which allows you to connect pedals between the preamp valves and power amp valves within the amp. This is usually for things like reverb and delay and other such time based effects. It means that when you change channel on your amp, the tail of the effect won't be messed with and if you're using distortion, you won't be distorting the reverb for example, you'll be adding reverb on top of the already distorted channel. Hope this helps!
p6122
aVAwesome, very helpful. By "dirty" do you mean something along the lines of a lo-fi sound, kind of old school black metal or dirty as in "muddy" where notes don't come through and closely tuned strings kind of sound the same? \u000a\u000aIn your opinion, what do you think is a common wattage a guitarist might use with a 2x12 or a 4x12 for medium to small size venues/clubs? (Less than 100 people). For metal?\u000a\u000aAlso, are cab and wattage sizes/combos common amongst certain genres? From what I gather, I'd assume a large sound for doom or death metal might mean large watts, large cab and maybe for black metal small watt head, large out put cab? Or is all of it irrelevant?\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a\u000a
p6123
aVBy dirty, I mean if both of those amps in the example were being played on a clean at a high volume, the lower wattage amp would started to sound more distorted. Well, I use a 50 watt head into a 2x12 cab. This is fine for me in those situations. Although my amp has the ability to alter the wattage from 5 to 50 and I usually play with it set to around 30 watts. There's no right answer for what type of amp to use really, just whatever you find to sound best for what you want.
p6124
aV&gt; Tube guitar amp head vs. solid state guitar amp heads?\u000a\u000aMany people think tubes sound better. They have a distinctive sound that solid state can't emulate. But it's mostly a religious issue; some bands don't even use their amp's distortion and few fans would ever notice.\u000a\u000a&gt; How does the wattage of the head translate to the guitar cab?\u000a\u000aThe amp powers the cab. More watts means more potential volume.\u000a\u000a&gt; What do cabs really do? Do they amplify the output of the already powerful head?\u000a\u000aCabs contain speakers. Without speakers, the amp makes no sound.\u000a\u000a&gt; What is the difference between a 1x12 and a 4x12? (Outside the number of speakers)\u000a\u000aMore speakers mean more volume. (Because it is physically moving more air.)\u000a\u000a&gt; Why do some musicians have a couple of heads and a couple of cabs on stage? \u000a\u000aUsually extra cabs are just for show. Sometimes you might set 2 stacks up for stereo effects though. Occasionally you want 2 different types of sound so you switch between 2 amps. Maybe some people are playing through both at once. Doesn't seem like something 99.9% of people would want or need to do.\u000a\u000a&gt; Sometimes the overdrive of the head has enough distortion that I'm looking for but what happens when you add a pedal before entering the head and combining the OD of the head and the effects of the distortion pedal? Is this taste related?\u000a\u000aIt's common to put a distortion or overdrive pedal before the amp. It's an additive effect and makes things more distorted, as you might expect. Some pedals also have subjectively preferable tone-shaping qualities - eg. the Tube Screamer and similar overdrives will reduce the bottom end somewhat, evening out the tone - so they double up as general tone improvement. It is entirely taste-related.\u000a\u000a&gt; Is it possible to connect into the head, out to a pedal and then back into the cab? What is the achieved effect?\u000a\u000aYes, this is common. (EDIT: By which I meant - amp -&gt; pedal -&gt; back to amp -&gt; cab.) Many amps have an effects loop for this purpose. The order in which you apply effects makes a big difference on the sound and explaining all the permutations of effects is too long to go into here. But generally speaking you want to apply most effects after the distortion (ie. in the effects loop) rather than before (ie. before the amp). A simple example would be reverb - you typically want to simulate a distorted guitar in a spacious room, rather than an unamplified guitar in a spacious room and then fed through distortion.
p6125
aV&gt;Tube guitar amp head vs. solid state guitar amp heads? - (My understanding is as basic as analogue vs. digital sound.)\u000a\u000aAnalogue vs digital is not a terrible way to describe it. Tube amps use old vacuum tube technology, while solid state uses modern circuit board technology. The traditional guitar sound is tube. Guitar distortion was created because of tubes... And for a long time solid state amps just didn't sound like the tubes that created the tones that people loved. And even today most people prefer tubes.\u000a\u000aBut, solid state amps have really caught up in the last decade or two. There are definitely good sounding solid state amps out there. I've heard recordings of solid state amps that sounded more tube-y than a real tube amp... But there is also many solid state amps that still don't quite sound right. If you decide to go solid state, make sure it's a good one.\u000a\u000aThe main advantage of tubes is their analogue sound; Very warm and soft, and they have certain subtleties that solid states often don't. Organic.\u000a\u000aSolid states stereotypically have advantages in weight, cost, versatility, reliability, and durability. Whether or not this comes at the price of tone depends on the amp and personal opinion.\u000a\u000aThere are a ton of little differences when it comes to playing and living with tubes and solid state amps.\u000a\u000a&gt;How does the wattage of the head translate to the guitar cab?\u000a\u000aUsually more wattage means more volume, but it's a diminishing returns deal. Doubling the wattage on the amp will make it much less than twice as loud. There's a lot of factors in volume between the type and size of speakers and the amp/wattage, but more watts usually means more volume. As someone said before, a higher wattage amp can play louder without any distortion than a low wattage amp at the same volume.\u000a\u000aTube amps are louder per watt than solid states, but solid states usually have a higher watt rating to compensate.\u000a\u000aAlso, the amplifier's wattage shouldn't exceed the amount labeled on the back of the cab. If the wattage running into the cab is too high, you risk blowing speakers if you turn up too loud.\u000a\u000a&gt;What do cabs really do? Do they amplify the output of the already powerful head?\u000a\u000aA cab is mandatory, because the head does not have any speakers. The cab is specifically a box of speakers to output the signal from the head. No cab means no sound.\u000a\u000aAlso, tube amps can be damaged if they're run without a cab or equivalent resistance load.\u000a\u000aAnd make sure you use a speaker cable to connect the head and cab. Instrument cables that you use to plug into your guitar are not the same thing.\u000a\u000a&gt;What is the difference between a 1x12 and a 4x12? (Outside the number of speakers)\u000a\u000aAs I mentioned before, wattage is not the only factor in volume. More speakers can push more air, and therefor have higher potential volume... But again, it's not that simple. Adding more speakers may increase the presence of the sound, but not the actual volume. Shit's complex, man.\u000a\u000aThe size of the speaker cabinet will affect the tone as well. Larger cabinets have more bass frequencies.\u000a\u000aBut more than one speaker always sounds better to my ears. I say don't go 1x12 unless you're looking for a specifically small rig. Consider 2x12 vs 4x12 instead.\u000a\u000a&gt;How many cabs can you connect/is usually connected to a head? What affect does more than one have? - (This might be dependent on the head)\u000a\u000aMost heads that I've seen have the ability to run 1 or 2 cabs. If you want to run even more cabs, you're going to need more equipment.\u000a\u000aMore than one cab means more speakers, which again affects volume and presence (In a not-so-straight forward way).\u000a\u000aIncreasing the number of cabs can also affect how much power the amp puts out, and how much power goes to each individual speaker... But what that means is going to depend on the set up in question. In most cases it doesn't change much, but I have run into situations in which it did matter.\u000a\u000a&gt;Why do some musicians have a couple of heads and a couple of cabs on stage? (Matt Pike playing in sleep for instance)\u000a\u000aThey may use different amps with different settings for different tones. \u000a\u000aBut, as I said above, most amps can only run two cabs. If you want even more volume and more cabs, you're going to need to have more heads to run more cabs.\u000a\u000aSome bands have a ton of cabs for aesthetic reasons. Not all cabs may be in use or even functional.\u000a\u000a&gt;Sometimes the overdrive of the head has enough distortion that I'm looking for but what happens when you add a pedal before entering the head and combining the OD of the head and the effects of the distortion pedal? Is this taste related?\u000a\u000aThere is a difference between how tube and solid state amps are affected by distortion/boost pedals. Some pedals are designed for tube amps, they boost the signal to distort the tubes more. Those are boost  or overdrive pedals. Other pedals create their own distortion. \u000a\u000aThere could be several reasons to do this, but it generally comes down to what the player likes better.\u000a\u000aPerhaps they like the type of distortion the pedal creates, or perhaps they're using the pedal to boost the signal to the tubes, creating a crunch that the amp doesn't do on it's own (Usually done to either create more distortion or affect the bass frequencies of the distortion). Or maybe they don't use pedals because they like the sounds their amp makes.\u000a\u000a&gt;Is it possible to connect into the head, out to a pedal and then back into the cab? What is the achieved effect?\u000a\u000aNot in the way that you describe it. The output from the head is different than the type that comes from your guitar. You don't plug a pedal between the head and cab.\u000a\u000aGuitar -&gt; Head -&gt; Pedal -&gt; Cab\u000a\u000aThis will not work, and will probably break something.\u000a\u000aHowever, most amps come with an effects loop. There's actually a couple different parts to inside the head. There's a pre-amp, where the tone controls are, and the power amp, which sends the signal to drive the speakers. The effects loop has an send and return sockets on the back of the amp. This creates the signal chain:\u000a\u000aGuitar -&gt; Head Pre-amp -&gt; Pedal -&gt; Head Power Amp -&gt; Cab\u000a\u000aHow that effects the sound is different for every pedal. You'll have to play around to find what you like best. But from what I remember, overdrives and distortions are before the pre-amp. Modulation type effects (Delay, reverb, chorus, phaser, etc) go after. But I don't run many pedals, so I can't really tell you how that works.

I wrote everything out in guitar pro so if anyone wants tabs just ask.\u000a\u000aA couple of things to note: I just moved into an apartment so I can't have my amp loud or project my voice the way I'm used to, which sucks cause it makes things harder to hear (but then again, black metal).

VI'd go with a Jackson soloist or a Rhoads with a decent set of Seymour Duncans. That'll be within your budget and give you what you're looking for.
p6171
aVAgreed, I've got an RRMG, very nice guitar for around $899 (would have preferred SDs than EMGs though).
p6172
aVYou want to change your sound in metal? Ibanez is typically a very piercing guitar meant to really cut through the rest of the band. Try out a Schecter or a PRS. They both have great options for six, seven, and eight string metal guitars.\u000a\u000aHere's the Omen Extreme - http://www.schecterguitars.com/guitars/omen-extreme-fr-2013-11-18-detail\u000a\u000aMaybe even check out some of their seven string models if you really want to change things up.\u000a\u000aPRS Also has a great series of tremolo guitars around that price-range. They have some great tone if you're into playing something that isn't always meant to be balls-to-the-wall brutal. If that's what you please, try going for something along the lines of a Jackson or an ESP/LTD. Jacksons are well-known shred machines.
p6173
aVFor under a thousand you may have to get a regular neck wood. I would also recommend stainless steel frets. If I were you i would look into getting a carvin. You can get everything you want plus if you don't like it you can send it back
p6174
aVNo such thing as an 'old' guitar. Beatup, broken, dirty, worn frets, etc. but not old. In fact, a guitar with some age on it that hasn't had any significant problems like warping or crackng is going to be a more reliable guitar.\u000a\u000aSound aside, do you like the way your current guitar plays? \u000a\u000a* Is the neck comfortable?\u000a* Is it too thick or too thin?\u000a* Is it to wide or narrow?\u000a* Is it too flat or too round? \u000a* Is the fret spacing too close or too wide? \u000a* Do you like where your hand falls in relation to the bridge\u000a* Is it easy to palm mute the strings in that position?\u000a* Is the guitar well-balanced when standing or is heavy at the headstock causing it to droop?\u000a\u000aIf the guitar plays well, but you are just not feeling the sound, then a pickup swap would be the better way to go. Different pickups can greatly alter the sound of any guitar. Depending on the year of your guitar, the pickups are either awful or just OK, not great. They apparently switched to a different pickup model in 2011. Also, the pickups are active as opposed to passive. If the sound has been changing on you, did you bother to check the battery? \u000a\u000aIf you are set on getting a new guitar, then the questions above will help you focus on exactly what you are looking for. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I have a stock RT650 (only made for a couple of years in the early 90's). It plays fine, sounds fine, is very reliable, but isn't as inspiring to play on as other guitars I own.

aVI fuckin' love Jackson guitars.

aVCheck out Agile guitars. I bought a used [Interceptor Pro](http://www.rondomusic.com/interceptorpro727ebtgreen.html) off ebay (mine was a silver burst) as my first 7 string, and have absolutely loved it. They also have other designs that might interest you, as well as a sort of custom shop to pick your features. \u000a\u000aAlso, would recommend PRS. Within your price range, you could pickup a guitar from the SE line for around $700, and use that extra cash to swap out the pickups for something more metal oriented. Or, if you can go a little over your budget (or find a good deal), take a look at the S2 line. 
p6177
aVI'd highly suggest finding a good RG Ibanez off craigslist. A lot of time people let them go so cheap because they have problems with the Floyd rose. \u000a\u000aSimple trick to set the bridge on them is pull the arm full up so the string have no tension on them. Then simply place a double A battery under neath the bridge. You'll see the back part where it curves and that'll set the bridge in perfect place to be level with the body. If it still can't hold a tune after that you simply go to a guitar store or online and replace any of the screws. \u000a\u000aI know this sounds so cheap, but I've played for over six years and I was shown this from a dude that played for his entire life and was in his 40's. He could play anything and it was the coolest trick with a guitar I've ever ran across. \u000a\u000aAgain it's just a cheap way to block the Floyd rose off.  Works every one I've ran across, hold tune. \u000a\u000aThe reason I also suggest Ibanez is they have some great stock pick ups. Even more so with the older ones. I can't tell you how many old black RG's I've picked up, but a few hours of work and had them just sounding amazing. \u000a\u000aPlayed them side by side to les pauls Jackson &amp; fenders and that thing would just smoke them. You have a very wide range of tone you can get out of it. \u000a\u000aAlso you can find a lot of cool stuff on [Jemsite](http://www.jemsite.com/) and buy really good parts from a site called \u000a[Dragonfire](http://www.dragonfireguitars.com/) I've used their humbuckers a few times and I really enjoyed them. Even more so for the price, they also offer custom nobs pickguards and a bunch of cool other little things to make your guitar sound good &amp; look cool. \u000a\u000a\u000aIf you hit up your local Craiglist &amp; run across anything Ibanez you'd like to know about feel free to message me for more input on it! They also have the best necks. Anything with a Wizard II is just amazing, feels great and gives you great fret board control. \u000a\u000aI love any guitar that sounds good. I don't care about the name on the headstock. With that being said I've found most Ibanez guitars to be the best bang for the buck and the most well rounded to play. \u000a\u000a\u000aSorry that was super long, I'm just kinda got on a roll.

aVIf you want to buy a new guitar you need to under stand the basics of a quality guitar.  Try out every kind of channel (dirty and clean). Play it for a solid 20 minutes before you buy it, and think of what you need it for playing.If you are rhythm Jackson soloist guitars are just going make you struggle with tone that much more, if you are playing lead then make sure every fret sounds perfect when you pick a note extremely hard.I'm in a band playing with an ESP MH 1000 and a PRS SE series, I've had them both for over three years and I still don't think about getting a new one because I took the time to consider what I was buying.

(lp6183
VSo I've got this bassist friend and we spend a lot of time at his house making up songs on the spot about stupid stupid shit(hating cunts, found a pizza, why's that pigeon got no feet?). then the other day we started blasting out this fantastic power metal because we just got used to making things slightly coherent in a short space of time. \u000a\u000aOur logic was you just answer questions that are asked between each line, like "in a distant place" yeah what's in a distant place? "where dwells castles and dragons" Ok, and are they good "the most evil beasts around" And do people tolerate this? "Well no, they bury their faces in ale filled flagons or cower under ground." and then both go "WHEYYYYY IT FIT!" NEXT LINE!\u000a\u000aAt least with cheesy metal you can literally say anything as long as it's somewhat relevant. \u000a\u000aFor something a bit more brutal, you could easily follow 36 Crazyfists lead and just sing angry things and waheohahow your way into making them fit.\u000a\u000a[Slit Wrist Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-PSt73Uj_o)\u000a\u000aThis probably isn't much help, but I had fun here!

aVI either write things to the rhythm of whatever has been recorded or start off with kind of poetry kind of shit and just tweak it as the flow of the music shapes things.\u000a\u000a  "completely wrong and you can't really do it"?  Fuck that noise man!  If it fucking works for you then it fucking works.  The creative process is different for everyone man, so don't let some know-it-all twat tell you that what your doing is "wrong".  Some people can write a song completely using sheet music and theory, other people jam it out, more again sit down and work out bits and pieces by recording riffs and stitching them together later, so I don't see why this shouldn't apply to lyrics.
p6186
aVI come up with a story and I try to "figure out" how to tell the story in the best way possible. I have a rough version of what I want to say and then I keep trying to rephrase it in a way that's poetic - imagery and wordplay are very important to me. Finally, I try to go nuts with rhyming without being dependent on pure end rhyme, which I believe makes lyrics cheesy and predictable while also limiting creative potential.\u000a\u000aHere's a sample from one of my songs, [Obsidian Heart.](http://apathybm.bandcamp.com/track/obsidian-heart-demo)\u000a\u000a&gt;Forged in the heart of the *crater*   \u000aThe *creator* looks in **dismay**   \u000aCasts **away** the **mistake**   \u000aTo be **erased** from memory by   \u000a*Time*   \u000aAs it passes *by*   \u000aDrenched by the **tears** of the Earth  \u000aThe **seared** *flesh* turns to *ash*  \u000aAs the life begins to end  \u000a\u000aI've alternated highlighting the rhyming with italics and bold.\u000a\u000aThe story is about cooling lava which turns from red hot like blood to cold and black obsidian, hence the title. The second part of the verse is my favorite part of the song because of how well it describes what is going on while maintaining complex rhyme. The "tears" turn the laval into "seared flesh" which looks like "ash".\u000a\u000aI do think lyrics tend to "come" to me, like I'm discovering them rather then piecing them together, but I might just be crazy.

aVFor me it helped to just write about a topic first in a stream of consciousness type of thing, then rearrange it until it fits a melody. I leave the text alone though once I'm finished, so that it looks more like a paragraph set to music, rather than specifically lyrics. Example:\u000a\u000aFor A Dying Man:\u000a\u000a&gt;If I should I find him once more, cowering and naked alone, tormented and cold, I will fulfil his final request. He was soaked in his blood, and his filth and sweat, when he told me how he became sick and hungry, and chose to die alone in the street. No comfort, no life. Only pain in perpetual night. \u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;I have abandoned a soul to his doom, and witnessed the ending of a brother\u2019s life. I watched him die, but not for a cause. I will only be perpetuating complacency until I live the day where it\u2019s my turn to suffocate on my own blood, in the last of my days.\u000a\u000a\u000aBasically try and view stuff like this:\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;Imagine the moment that you will die\u000a\u000a&gt;Awaiting your travels beyond\u000a\u000a&gt;Wishing its repugnance restores and tames\u000a\u000a&gt;your tortured soooouuuuul\u000a\u000a\u000aAs this:\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt; Imagine the moment that you will die, awaiting your travels beyond, wishing its repugnance restores and tames your tortured soul.

p6197

V Your mix, while I can technically hear everything, is missing the heart of the tone. That comes from your guitars. Your rhythm guitars are almost non existent. Your guitar tone seems very scooped in the mid-range... Mids are your friend my man! Also, it feels like everything is so saturated with reverb that it all sounds like it's 10 miles away. Your main vocal is HEAVY on the right side. If it were me, I'd go and remove any reverb from anything that has the word guitar in it. I'd also pan the vocals dead center and remove any stereo effects on them. Lastly I would bring the drums up in the mix and bring the keys down. Keys are best with a lot of space, but you have them cranked here. I would even go so far as to say they might even be louder than the drums, which takes away from the punch of your recording. \u000a\u000aHope this helps brother!

asVHow can I grow in my writing? I feel stagnant. (Guitar)
p6236
(lp6237
VWriting music has always been a combination of ear and theory to me. You gotta hear what you're writing before you even write it and you should at least know how some of it makes sense theoritically. Do you ever imagine sweet riffs in your head? The first step would be to try to transcribe that from your brain to the fretboard and then analyze wtf is going theoretically so that you can add to it based on your knowledge of music when/if your ear fails you.
p6238
aVI can hear riffs in my head, but by the time I finally find the note it starts on I lose it completely, if I even find the first note. Should I just do more of those online ear training things? I'm sure it's just something I need to focus on more when I practice.\u000a\u000aPart of me has the sneaking suspicion that I'll always be what a metal musician friend of mine (I do have a few, they just all live hundreds of miles away and we grew apart when I left for college) called "a performance guitarist." Which he described as someone who can't write but can play, it made me very frightened.
p6239
aVIt should take you no more than 2 seconds to find a note on the fretboard. Hear the note in your head, and slide your finger along a string until you hit the same note. It might be an octave high or low, but that doesn't matter. This is about your ear - if it takes you longer than 2 seconds to find a note on the fretboard then you need to practice doing exactly that, over and over, until you're good at it.\u000a\u000aAs for forgetting the riff, it helps if you repeat it back to yourself a bunch of times, maybe even hum or sing it, and then try to play along to that. Playing along to music you hear, without tabs or notation, is another skill you can teach yourself.\u000a\u000aNow, being able to play along to stuff you hear *quickly*, without pausing on every note... that requires a decent understanding of intervals. If you hear 2 notes in succession, you should be able to know that if you find the first note on the fretboard, you know exactly, without trying different frets, where the next one will be. You should be able to recognise a minor third, a perfect 5th, etc.\u000a\u000aThere is also a feedback loop here too - if you know theory, then it makes all these other tasks easier. eg. If you know a song is in E natural minor, then the chances of any given note in the song being an F or a C# are very low. This means you find the right note quicker, you position your hands more effectively for the scale you're in, etc.\u000a\u000aThere are tools that can help you, but it sounds like you're aware of them. The important thing is that you keep working on all these aspects, but also that you link them together, not in isolation. If you're not translating what you learn of theory to concrete applications of playing metal on the guitar then it won't help you or stick with you as well.
p6240
aVHey, I can honestly say that learning some theory has brought life back into my playing. I started around the same age as you and very slowly, progressed and stagnated, up until 28 years old and a few months ago started taking lessons from a guitar teacher who actually enjoys metal.\u000a\u000aI thought about online classes but the dynamic wasn't the same, I pay for a person's time and it just so happens they adapt to my learning curve and can respond to what I'm doing, the hands on approach is very different because the time spent is valuable for the both of you. It puts enough fire under your ass to say "I'm paying for these lessons, and I don't want to waste this person's time." Finding a good teacher who "trims the fat" but can still teach you according to your needs is the tricky part. Hope you get inspired again, if something starts to get boring up the ante!
p6241
aVIt sounds too music nerd for a lot of people, but brushing up on theory and expanding your knowledge always gives you new ideas.  Listening to stuff that's not metal is handy as well.
p6242
aVHere's a couple recommendations from my experience:\u000a\u000aFirst off, if you have the opportunity to take a music theory or composition class, take it. Sure it's nerdy/not metal, whatever, and a lot of the time you'll feel the skills aren't things you need, but it really does help in ways you might not even notice. Honestly a lot of what you need to write are the sort of "basic" musical skills that get glossed over by a lot of the self taught guitar crowd, i.e. reading, ear-training and dictation (I include myself in this, I'm much worse at all of those skills than I would like to be, and I'm graduating with a degree in music in a couple months).\u000a\u000aAnother, easier suggestion is to try listening to new kinds of music. Especially if you're pretty good at guitar--and it sounds like you're probably better than I am--it can be a good experiment to expose yourself to some new uses of the instrument. For instance, if you're not usually into stoner metal, listen to some just to experiment, listen to the sounds they make with their instruments, and try to make similar sounds with yours. It doesn't matter if you know what it is they're doing, theoretically or technically, but recognizing a sound and figuring out how to make it is, I would argue, the most important step in learning to write music (especially in a riff-heavy genre like metal).\u000a\u000aThird, and this part goes hand in hand with my other recommendations, as you're doing anything, listening, playing, writing, start paying attention to the units of sound that are used in the guitar part, and train yourself to recognize them in another context. It'll be easier if you have some basic musical knowledge (the names of intervals, for instance). If I were you, I would read up on some basic music theory and language, and then go back into songs you've already learned to play, and figure out how they work (for instance, "okay, this shape on guitar makes a tritone, this is a major third, and here's where they get used in the key, and what kind of sound they make." sorry if this part sounds basic, I don't know how much theory you have under your belt). The objective of this is that, soon, when you hear a sound in your head, instead of having to search the fretboard note by note, you'll immediately recognize "oh, this is a tritone chord, and it's based on this note," or "the next note I want is a major sixth above the last one." Once you know what those things sound like, and know how to play them on the guitar, it becomes way easier to write riffs and songs. If you figure out your home key, everything else tends to just fall into place, and a great side-effect of having some extra theoretical knowledge is that if you find you're not sure what to do next, you can think about what *other* composers usually do next, and use that as a jumping off point (good artists borrow, great artists steal, etc).\u000a\u000aFinally, just practice writing a lot. I've gotten to the point that I'll write complete, fully arranged songs that I have no intention of ever using, just to pass the time and experiment in other styles. If you don't have it already, I'd recommend buying Guitar Pro (or, you know, don't *buy* it, if that's your preference), since it's great, cheap software for fiddling around in, makes figuring out rhythmic notation and time signatures super easy, and honestly, even after using much higher-end software like Sibelius and Finale, I think Guitar Pro has one of the most intuitive interfaces of all music writing software.\u000a\u000aSorry that got pretty long winded, it's a recurring problem of mine. Hope some of that will be helpful. As a closing piece of advice, a lot of people talk about writing music as if it takes some kind of magical "creativity" gene, which personally I think is bullshit. Writing music is a skill that can be taught and trained, and while some people might be more predisposed toward it than others, there's no barrier for entry. You don't have to accept being a "performance guitarist" if you don't want to, and are willing to put in the work it takes to learn. Enjoy your metal journey!
p6243
aVFantastic response! This gave me a lot to think about.\u000a\u000a I actually already use guitar pro. I've written a few songs on it but it always ends up simplistic. 
p6244
aVI would just like to add that if you don't want to buy Guitar Pro, [TuxGuitar](http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/) is very similar it's free.
p6245
aVTrue. The sound and UI for TuxGuitar aren't as polished as Guitar Pro, but it's an extremely competent (and open source!) editor.
p6246
aVOne thing I always tell people who are trying to write music but have little faith in the stuff they write is, record EVERYTHING you write. Learning how to use a DAW and buying an interface to record with is vital. For me, this has allowed the critique and in depth analysation of what I write, after which i choose the parts that sound good and work on that, often starting a new song with just that section. When i say new song, I don't mean 3.30 mins of music, i mean like 2/3 riff sections to just see how it flows. I've found that this also allows you to develop a personal song writing style. You need to not be afraid of writing shit music for a while. Much in the same way as practicing guitar, these things come with time. Challenge yourself, some days write slow songs, some days write fast songs. Some days write chord riffs with the toughest chords you know, some days write Iomi style single note riffs. Variation and recording every riff you write is key. If you have trouble remembering a riff, sing it into your phone, then transcribe it on to guitar, myself and all the songwriters I know do this, its extremely helpful.
p6247
aVI'm in the same boat as you - never been in a functional metal band. One of the most recent notable contributions to improving my technique to be listening to a ton of Steve Vai, particularly the album "The Story of Light" along with equal amounts of Trivium (mainly "Vengeance Falls" and "In Waves"). There's a lot to be learned from the way Vai does bends, long sustains, and adds a more "vocal" aspect to is guitar with volume/gain adjustments throughout his songs. Another recommendation (you may not struggle with this, but it's worth mentioning) would be to learn to play something slow and clean before you jump into 180bpm. I had to essentially re-learn to play guitar when it finally dawned on me how important it is that each note is distinct and uniform when doing fast riffs. \u000a\u000aFor example, look at my last reddit submission (top of my profile), which was a rough draft guitar solo instrumental. Took me  about 45min to and hour to lay down the two guitar tracks for the solos from 1:19 to around 1:50 in that song because I decided to force myself to play clearly before playing quickly. This is especially important when you have multiple guitar tracks harmonizing.\u000a\u000aEdit: Accidentally a punctuation.
p6248
aVMake sure you are learning song by ear. I'm similar to you in that I'm opposite: I feel like in an adequate player, for the most part, but I can write riffs and licks from dusk to dawn. More often than not, I write stuff I can't even play. \u000a\u000aI hit a plateau after about my first year and a half of learning how to play guitar (I started at 19),  and I didn't know what to do. I started listening to new music, that helped a bit. Then, I wanted to learn how to play new songs and styles to diversify my mental musical repitiore (sorry, I can't fucking spell that word and my autocorrect is being a fucking idiot). I also made sure to try as hard as I could to learn songs by ear. And this is the reason, I think, that I can write songs much better than I used to. If you take the time and really practice learning a song by ear, it's like you'll be gaining a sense of clarity that you were lacking. You fill the gap between what is arbitrary and abstract and what you can construct and make tangible. At first, you're not really gonna see it. When I first started writing, none of the songs I wrote actually sounded the way they did in my head. They were just as close as I could get. Now, I hear a melody in my head, play it how I hear it. I'll record it and play it back, then I hear the harmonies, and I can punch that out. And it's very satisfying to be able to do this. I'm assuming this is where you're trying to get to.\u000a\u000aIt's okay to cheat and look at tabs when you're just fucking stumped. But overall, if you stick with it, you can learn songs by ear with no issues. If you want an easy band to try this with, I recommend Gojira. The grandeur of this band comes from performance and tone more so than the actual quality of the writing. The writing is good, just in no way complex musically speaking. Most of their songs are in D standard. I think From Mars to Sirius is the album that perfectly balances fun songs to play with writing and technique that's not to hard at all. 
p6249
aVI honestly think this is what I'm lacking in my playing. I can't play much by ear and I think this is another thing I'm going to actively start working on. Thanks!

VI personally like the music. It's like a chiller In Flames combined with some alternative metal. The mixing is the only thing keeping me from really loving it. The snare sounds a tad bit thin, the bass is lacking, and the vocals should really be double-tracked or duplicated. The clean layers need more compression and reverb to sit better in the mix and have a bigger sound imo. The guitar is a little thin too, so panning, compression, and eq should fix that. Also I don't know what you are planning, but if the end is like that then the next song should pick it right up. If it doesn't, then it's too sudden and anti-climactic.  \u000a  \u000aNow to make you feel good about yourself:  \u000a  \u000aThe songwriting is pretty fucking awesome! It's definitely better than most of the metal I've heard on reddit. I really like the second half of the song after it chills out a bit in that it's simple but still beautiful. The playing is really solid on every instrument, and I especially want to commend the drums. Are they programmed? They sound really authentic. Also for the love of christ, tell me what you're using for a bass setup, because that tone is what I've been seeking.

Superior Drummer 2.0 with Metal Foundry expansion.\u000a\u000aThe bass I'm using is an Ibanez SR705. \u000a\u000aAs far as processing I split the DI's into three separate tracks: \u000a\u000a* One track has everything but the lows filtered out, and that's pretty much left alone. \u000a\u000a* The second track has the lows, and low mids filtered out, and is run through the 'Rock Classic' model in Pod Farm 2.0 (Which is an SVT clone). \u000a\u000a* The third track is mostly the same as the second track except it has more of the mids filtered out and has a [bass overdrive](http://www.theserinaexperiment.net/software.html) pedal in front of the amp.\u000a\u000aThen I buss all the tracks together and eq and compress the shit of them as usual! \u000a\u000aP.S.\u000aI followed you back on soundcloud. Your shit sounds pretty awesome.
p6273
aVThe snare sounds a bit thin in the mix, and I'd personally pull that bass forward, making it louder. I personally dislike the music, but the playing and mixing are fairly decent. Well done, dude. Keep on keepin' on.  
p6274
aVThanks for the feedback! Balancing the low end elements is a constant struggle for me. That's something I think I'll be working on until the day I die.
p6275
aVSeriously, muddy low ends is a struggle we all have to fight.  Making room for a thunderous kick while having a bass that is pumping can be a really difficult thing to mix.  Even harder to make it sounds *right* when mastering, without compressing the hell out of everything worth listening to. Anyway, I'm sure that people who enjoy this subgenre of metal will really dig the tunes. \u000a\u000aWhat kind of gear are you using for the mixing and mastering process?
p6276
aVAmen,\u000a\u000aHonestly, for the most part gear-wise I'm just using the plugins that come with Logic, and my shitty $150 M-AUDIO monitors. \u000a\u000aThe guitars are a combination of [LePou](http://lepouplugins.blogspot.com/) (Lecto, and Le456), and Pod Farm 2.0\u000a\u000aThe drums are Superior Drummer 2.0\u000a

aVThis is pretty cool. I really like the interplay between all the instruments, it creates a really dense and interesting sound.

aVYeah, I'm not entirely happy with how the bass turned out, as it feels a little too buried in the mix most of the time. I plugged the bass guitar right into my audio interface and used digital amps, but did likewise for the guitar, so the problem was probably just me being generally inexperienced at mixing this kind of music.

(lp6335
Vscales. Use a metronome. Start slow, then gradually speed up. Then when you master playing a scale from top to bottom and vise versa in ridiculous fast speeds, learn how to do different patterns of that scale like arpeggios, random intervals, etc.\u000a
p6336
aVWould it be a good idea to start with major, minor, the modes, diminished etc and then move onto other scales and their modes?    How much time do you think I should dedicate to scales? 
p6337
aVIt doesn't matter as much what the specific scales are IMO - just try to mix it up a little with them. I would also recommend doing the scales with different fingering combinations. IE, start with 1234, then 1324, 1342, etc. This will also train all your fingers to be used on demand.\u000a\u000aAlways focus on cleanliness too. Have good pick and muting control and try to fret with as little pressure as you can to get the note clean.\u000a
p6338
aVit depends on you. the major and minor scales are pretty much building blocks in music. In metal, the harmonic minor and pentatonic minor are standard. Find a scale that most of your favorite bands use (most likely its harmonic minor) and learn off that. But learning other scales is just as important for finger dexterity. 
p6339
aVJust practice playing those songs at slower tempos. Itll keep you interested in playing, while also helping your technique. Metronomes are good but also try playing along with the song slowed down. Playing scales over and over until you think you're fast enough will suck the enjoyment out of playing pretty fast.

asVBridges and transition between riffs
p6353
(lp6354
VSo, the way look at this is that you've already written your riffs or everything as far as general sections go for a full song. But not you want to figure out how to bridge the gaps between them. So you're going from Writing/Composing to Arranging.\u000a\u000aThere may different ways to do this, and you'll have to fine tune thing to gt them the way you want. First, you have to be sure, or at least have a clear idea, of what order your parts are gonna be in. You should currently have in your mind what's your intro/outro, chorus, verse, any breakdowns or whatever. Then, open up a DAW, any will do. Get your tempo going, then start recording. Its just a rough draft so you dot have to really sorry about messing up or anything. Bonus points if you can use a drum machine to sit in, its like jamming with yourself. \u000a\u000aAs you start to record your parts, you'll run into those walls where you need a transition, so when this happens, try to play something that will fit in your song. If your song is fast, maybe try some kind of buil up. If its slow, try a fill or like a variation of some sort. I really don't know how to explain it. Im actually really bad at transitions, but this is what I'm doing to work on it. Nevertheless, record your music man. Throw shit together, even if it doesn't fit. You don't want to forget those riffs man. I've forgotten so many good ass riffs, its a damn shame.

aVPeavey 5150/6505 (or clone) and 7 string or drop C is what it sounds like, to me.

aVYep. This, plus some form of Overdrive pedal (Ibanez/Maxon tube screamer, mxr wylde overdrive, read up on some good ones), and a noisegate (ISP decimator, Boss NS-2, mxr smart gate, etc...). It's a classic unbeatable combo for metal. 
p6364
aVHave you tried tuning your guitar to the same tuning as that song? Tuning your guitar to drop A or so makes it sound pretty menacing, although I prefer to sick with Drop D or C.\u000a\u000aOther than that just play with the knobs  on your amp or pedals until you get something good. The tone on your guitar should be turned up and you're obviously gonna need some gain, but it's good to experiment and try things for yourself. Good luck! :D
p6365
aVWhat kind of pedals would you recommend? I use a Gio Ibanez with a Fender Mustang that has built in effects and presets.

aVWell I personally use an MXR Fullbore Metal distortion pedal into and MXR 10 Band EQ pedal into a Line 6 Spyder. \u000a\u000aI love my pedal, but I also tweak it a little bit with the equalizer and amp settings. Only recently have I been able to find a tone I really like out of the pedal. It's easy to put too much gain on it and get that Dimebag tone. \u000a\u000aIf you have a guitar center near you I'd recommend trying out some different distortions. I do like the Fullbore metal, but it's easy to get carried away with the gain. I think it's worth giving it a try though.

aVYou said in another comment that you have an Ibanez Gio and a Fender Mustang (I'm guessing it's a practice amp). I have a few things here I'd like to add.\u000a\u000a1. Stock pickups for Ibanez guitars, especially lower end ones have a rather narrow tone. It's best to upgrade them with aftermarket pickups. And I personally would not buy anything from the Gio line. I recommend at least something like a RG321. Used Ibanez RG321s are a great value. But even after buying one, I would buy and install better pickups anyway. Try to find out what pickups your favorite guitarists use or find reviews on youtube.\u000a\u000a2. Most likely you'll need to down/droptune, which requires having thick enough strings to hold string tension (you'll also have to set up the guitar for intonation and fret buzz). On my Ibanez(es), I can pull off a Drop C tuning with a 10-52 set. I recommend Ernie Ball Skinny top Heavy Bottom for a packaged off-the-shelf set. Or check out stringjoy.com to create your own set (I use 10-13-17-28-38-50 personally).\u000a\u000a3. You'll need more than just high gain effects to pull off what I hear in that track. I hear a slight flange effect in there as well. Maybe save up and invest in one of the many multi-fx pedals available out there. I personally own a Zoom G3 and I love it. But there are other options out there such as the Line 6 POD HD300.\u000a\u000aNow, I'm not coming in here to say that you need to go out and blow all of your money on new equipment just to sound any good. But there is a level of investment you have to reach to be above mediocre and come closer to achieving your goals as a guitarist.

aVDamn, this is the most helpful comment I've ever seen! I've been looking into getting a Dimarzio pickup and an emg, but I don't know how to install them and guitar center's waiting list for repairs are insane (it took a month to get my strings changed one time). I should have mentioned that I also have an Epiphone Les Paul (got it used and the 12th fret is dead). It's actually the first guitar I've ever owned. 
p6370
aVIt only takes a basic understanding of electrical work to replace most pickups. Do you have a friend who does electronic/electrical work or maybe has done pickup replacements themselves? You just need to find someone who can read a wiring diagram and solder properly. \u000a\u000aI dunno about the Les Paul as much, as I only play Ibanez guitars since I started playing guitar again. Ibanez is quite common and popular among many modern metal bands. Les Pauls have their place also, though, just not with me.
p6371
aV&gt; guitar center's waiting list for repairs are insane (it took a month to get my strings changed one time).\u000a\u000aI don't know what the one near you is like, but if they're anything like the store in my town, they just outsource the repair work to a local technician. I looked up the guy and just started taking my stuff directly to him. He usually has it ready in a day or two, and does it for half the price I'd pay going through GC. If you haven't looked into that, you might want to. It'll probably save you a lot of money.
p6372
aVIf I remember right, a lot of that djent tone comes from the eq on amp; almost no lows, a good bit of mids and a lot of highs. Combine this with downtuning to A or so, and you get that weird, bouncy tone. The other big thing about that sound is the hyper aggressive noise gates.
p6373
aVIf you're looking to record that sort of sound, remember that less gain is more, especially when double-tracking :)
p6374
aVPickups have a lot to do with it.\u000a\u000aThe other day I was at a get-together and I brought my Dean with hot 80's Charvel pickups. Did a little thrash shredding, then my friend plugs in his Schecter and it sounds like very newschool metal/core/postmetal whatever stuff. Very jowly and tight sound. I asked him what pickups he had and he said they were Seymour Duncans (I forgot the model name). So I can't say for sure but I think SD's will do you good for that kind of sound.
p6375
aVIsn't the example more djent than metalcore? Metalcore to me is bands like [KSE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z_RCdgBqkI).
p6376
aV/u/dirge_othe_bumblebee might be right that it's a 6505, but I think it sounds squishy and dark enough to be a Rectifier. Try TSE 808 with the tone most of the way up, drive 9 o'clock, volume 2 o'clock, LePou Lecto, increase the mids and reduce the bass/depth, increase the presence to get a djentier sound. Boost 2 db around 1500 hz. If that doesn't sound right, just swap the Lecto for the Nick Crow 8505. Use a neutral-sounding impulse response like ASEM Recto or the God's Cab impulses, not Guitar Hack or Catharsis.
p6377
aVDon't forget the bass guitar's contribution.  Meaty guitar tone on an album is usually the combination of bass and guitar.  
p6378
aVIs there ever any distortion for the basses? I can't really tell if there is a bass guitar unless I feel it in the song or if it's incredibly obvious (like in Feel Good Inc. By Gorillaz). [This guy](http://youtu.be/mk0x-kNIgaw) changed everything I know.

VI enjoyed it man. Don't take this the wrong way, but the opening riffs of Winged Messenger totally made me think of some music from MegaMan X... this is a good thing.\u000a\u000aThe playing is a bit spotty in some places, but nothing major. What tuning are you in? Sounds pretty low, I'm gunna guess somewhere around C standard? I think the singing could use a bit of work but I have a feeling you are relatively new to it.\u000a\u000aDrums n' bass were solid. I think the drums could come up a touch. +1dB. Sometimes it's worth it to just sit with your mix and fuck tracks around by +/- even 0.1dB. A good trick (if you don't already know this) is to use group tracks to channel a bunch of related tracks down one bus. So you can funnel all your drum tracks down a single bus. Get a good drum sound going on its own, then add the rest of the tracks back in and you can adjust the level of the drums as a whole, as one volume slider, relative to the rest of the tracks. \u000a\u000aI like the harmonized lines as well, some pretty cool phrasing going on.\u000a\u000aKeep it up!

aVHaha I don't take the Mega Man comment as a bad thing at all man.   I've played many hours of classic games so I'm sure it pops out somewhere.  \u000a\u000aAs far as tuning I'm just tuned down a whole step, and then dropped down to C on the low string.  I agree about my vocals too, I've been singing for a while but I'm still getting used to writing with my own voice in mind.\u000a\u000aThanks for the advice about the mixing of the drums.   I'll definitely have to try that.  Just really difficult to get a good idea of how the mix is truly coming together without a good set of monitors.

asVAwesome Home Guitar Recording Tutorial By Periphery Guitarist!
p6398
(lp6399
VThought this one would be super helpful for guys and gals just starting out in this department.
p6400
aVExcept the part where he provides **completely wrong** information about input volume. You should never, ever be trying to get digital input signals to near clipping. That was true in the analog world. The equivalent of close to 0db analog is -18dbfs digital. The signal:noise ratio, even at substantially lower volumes than that, is still perfectly fine, and that's how nearly every professional records, within +-3db or so. Unless you want your guitars to sound like a Periphery record (read: squished to within an inch of their life), do not follow Misha's advice on this count. Everything else is useful for beginners, but there are better (and more methodologically sound) tutorials on this subject.
p6401
aVBy definition, there is no compression occurring if there is no clipping, so this has nothing to do with the compressed sound of his guitars, no? This makes it unnecessary advice, not bad.
p6402
aVWell, by definition it kills almost all your headroom on the guitars, so unless you then use the fader (which he does, which again screws with the instrument sound for no reason) to bring the levels down, your entire mix also loses headroom if you balance the other instruments to that level. \u000a\u000aThere's an entire thread on the Andy Sneap forum about this video, and everyone came to the same conclusion about this hahah. It's terrible advice. Misha is just wantonly violating the basic principles of gain staging.
p6403
aVI would love to read the thread if you have a link handy! (cue link to "let me google that for you")\u000a\u000aThinking about it though, what you say absolutely makes sense. Since there is not much of a reason to mix so close to 0db, don't put your other instruments in danger of clipping and simply lower the gain.
p6404
aV[Here ya go :)](http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/bar/927020-bulb-guitar-recording-tutorial.html)\u000a\u000aDidn't mean to shoot down the thread, and it's certainly a worthwhile video for the other parts! 
p6405
aVThanks dude. No worries; we're here to learn.
p6406
aVIf I may ask; why again is it bad to maximise the S:N ratio? I get that headroom is the space between your absolutely pushed tone, and where it starts to clip horrendously, but as long as you're below clipping treshold, you're golden, right?\u000a\u000aAt least in a metal rhythm context, you don't need to have a massive headroom as far as I can understand, since your tone is already distorted beyond measure, where as something like pop or blues (or metal leads), headroom is really important for tonal expression. \u000a\u000aIn the thread you liked to, with the post by "TRUIE", he explains doing it the bulb way pushes the DI by +18dB compared to analog recording, and that it generates DI clipping. How does that make sense, since you can (and is explained by Misha how to) detect clipping on the interface?\u000a\u000a(Disclaimer: I'm merely self-taught, and trying to follow whatever sensical audio-engineering method is shown)
p6407
aVS:N ratio doesn't matter as much in the digital context. Try it: go get a distorted guitar tone and record it at close to 0dbfs (near digital clipping). Pull the fader down to -18dbfs. Take a separate track and record at -18dbfs. There isn't going to be very much difference at all in the noise floor, except you're going to be driving a cheap interface to make it sound "hotter"- but killing every ounce of your headroom in the process. Yes, headroom matters more for other genres, but as any engineer will tell you, it still matters! And like I said earlier, unless you pull the fader down, which also is generally not a great idea, you have to drive up the other instruments to the level of the guitars, which places your entire mix at risk of sounding like Death Magnetic. \u000a\u000aLook at the chart TRUIE posted. +2db on a VU meter = +4 db analog = -16 digital. Misha is recording at 0. That would be +20db on the analog scale- completely off the charts. \u000a\u000a[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enhcve9Lblc) explains it at 2:20.
p6408
aVPardon, but why is pulling the fader down a bad idea as well? I thought the faders were just a "simple" volume control, whereas input signal is much more context sensitive to what is played, and way more suspectible to clipping.\u000a\u000aThe video was quite good at explaining why a lot of people go "max the DI" and why it's not relevant in a digital setting, and gives off a lot of useful tips to a non-metal context. The practice is good to follow too as far as I can see to prevent potential clipping in metal rhythm, but it's not crucial (at least not as far as I can see).\u000a\u000aAnd death magnetic was an absolute disaster mixwise, to the point even a rookie like me can avoid that scenario. :D
p6409
aVLoad an instance of Superior Drummer or something in your DAW and turn the fader down 20db, then equalize the volume level. Try it with a distorted bass tone as well, or an acoustic guitar. The volume may get lower, but you will be able to detect changes in the sound. Faders aren't side effect-free. \u000a\u000aBut the real question you should be asking is, "Why would you max out anything if it doesn't change the sound that much [pre-fader!] and reduces your headroom and forces you to mess with other things to compensate?" Just leave the levels be. If you could maximize and minimize things willy-nilly, people wouldn't practice gain staging between plug-ins. But they do, because input level matters to the sound a lot, and doing weird things to your input level is silly.

VIt happens to the best of us.  What I've found helps me is consuming some new material.  Find some new bands to listen to, or maybe go back to your beginnings and take a listen to the bands that originally made you excited about playing music in the first place.  It's really just about freshening up your perspective and attitude.  \u000a\u000aYou could also try writing something outside of your genre, just for the sake of having fun.  I've written some funky jams just for fun, and one of them ended up getting used by a friend who has a Podcast, as his intro.  \u000a\u000aAnother tip is\u2026 don't be so critical of yourself when you're just free writing and hashing out fresh ideas.  Let it all flow out, try anything, go as crazy as you can.  Then save your work and come back to it in a few days with fresh ears.  Some of my own favorite tracks happened this way.  Keep in mind not everything has to be a perfect masterpiece.  \u000a\u000aOne more thing!  Do you have any other creative outlets?  I've recently taken up drawing as a hobby, just simple sketching.  And I've found that sometimes when the music and riffs just aren't happening on a particular day, I'll take a step back and find something to sketch out of a comic book, or a car out of magazine, or just whatever comes to mind.  Now, I'm not good at this at all, but that isn't the point.  The point is to just get the gears turning in any creative way, and build on that momentum.  \u000a\u000aIn the end, just really enjoy being creative.\u000a\u000aSorry for the long post.  Hope some of it helped!

aVIt did man, thanks. I've been finding myself drained because I don't have any other band members. I want to collab, but its hard finding anyone with similar tastes I can bounce ideas off of.\u000a\u000aI should go back to my roots like you said. I dont have much hobbies outside of this, work and video games tho. Its now really a process in meditation. \u000a
p6421
aVI can't stress writing or learning stuff outside of your typical genre enough.\u000a\u000aWhenever I'm stuck in a rut I'll go look up some jazz chords and learn how to string them together. Boom! Power chord melody with a "weird" Jazz chord thrown in there. Just got a new verse. \u000a\u000aI also found that looking up country (a genre I don't enjoy) helps reinvigorate that dark feeling in metal when I go back.\u000a\u000a(Also, Gypsy Jazz stuff is fun and great for getting some new odd strumming and solo patterns.) 
p6422
aVWhen I hit a wall I start learning other peoples songs.  Or transcribing things from other instruments to mine.  Usually classical piano pieces.  Obviously not note for note but I pick out bits and pieces and apply them to guitar or bass.\u000a\u000aSometimes I discover new note progressions or combinations that re-inspire me to apply to my work.\u000a\u000aSometimes it's merely to keep my brain active in a musical way.\u000a\u000aHaving a large music collection that spans many genres is extremely useful in this way.
p6423
aVYou could just try taking a break from guitar completely for a few days, even a week. I know it sounds like a lot, but if you have been at it for long enough, a week is really not much. I know that when I haven't played guitar for 3 or 4 days, when I finally get back to it, there is definitely more fire than usual, as I release all the shit from the last 3-4 days into my playing. If you are wood sheddin' it every day for several hours, or whatever, sometimes you just get burned out and fatigued. 
p6424
aVOccupy yourself otherwise. You know how you always have awesome ideas when you're in class, at work, or in the shower? Do some unrelated work. Fire up the sponge and wash some dishes (without listening to music) or something similar. Then, when an idea hits, run to the other room and play it out real quick. \u000a\u000aAlternatively, if you're capable of decently carrying a tune, keep a portable recording device on you (your phone probably has an app) and just hum or "diddly da doo da chugga cha chugga cha" the riff idea so you can revisit it when you get back to your optimal writing space. \u000a\u000aOne more thing. If you have a quick and easy way to record, start making "riff puke" files. Just start recording yourself wanking off on the guitar (caffeine helps here). Eventually you'll have a database to pull from and transpose into the correct key when you have a great riff, but you're stumped for what should follow it.

I'm sorry, I'm woogetry but my real name is Sunshine. I would very much like to know more about mixing and what I did wrong. \u000a\u000aI used the same guitar for the different parts and I know that's bad on tone :( I'm actually uploading a full play through of one of our songs today so I'd love to hear you guitar Greg! 
p6434
aVThe internet is full of assholes, my friend!\u000a\u000aThe drums are too loud. Not by much, but they are. They need to come down by about -2dB I would say. The "click" of the kick drum is drowning out the guitars. The guitars have too much hair/sizzle on them (treble.) I understand that tone is very subjective and maybe this is just how you like your sound, but you need to have enough mid-range clarity, punch and bark in your tone so that people can clearly hear what notes and chords you are playing. Keep in mind that the guitar is fundamentally a mid-range instrument. You're obviously a very tight player so it would only help to accentuate that by making your guitar sound as clear as possible. \u000a\u000aTypically when you record you should turn your gain down a bit, vs. when you are jamming or just playing by yourself. Most microphones, especially dynamic ones (for ex. Shure SM57) impart natural compression to the signal, so if your guitar tone is already super gainy coming out of the amp, the mic will just add to that and you end up with gutless mush. I'm not saying your tone is gutless mush because it isn't really, but it's just an example. My favourite trick for getting a good tone in the mics is a simple one: put your face right in front of the speaker and play. If it doesn't sound good there, then it will not sound good to the microphone.\u000a\u000aAs for using the same guitar for all the tracks, it's not a problem, I do it all the time. You just have to either EQ the tracks slightly differently so that they each shine through, or EQ your amp differently when you record so that they don't conflict with each other. For rhythm tracks you want a little more low end and some nice crispness, but a little bit less mid-range. Then for any lead phrasing / solos, you want less low end, more mid range, and more upper-mid range, so they punch through. It can be a bit of a balancing act and it's tricky to describe it with words. But basically you want to have each section of your song (drums, bass, rhythm guitars, lead guitars, etc.) occupying its own portion of the frequency spectrum so they are not fighting each other for space in the sound. \u000a\u000aAnother trick I like doing is using track automation to alter the EQ of various tracks on the fly as the song is playing. So let's say you have a solo, right when it kicks in, do an automated EQ on the rhythm guitars to drop out some mid-range (for ex., -2dB @ 750Hz) so the solo has more room to breathe. The instant the solo is done, the rhythm guitars go back up +2dB again so you never even notice the change. Sometimes very small changes like this can make or break a mix. Think of it like the icing on a cake.\u000a\u000a
p6435
aVYou sir, are a great man. You should be called Great Guitar Greg.\u000a\u000aThis is the first time I've ever put my things out there...here in the vast world of the internet.

aVWell it just sounds like it's coming from an old music box. Kind of tinny sounding?

I went from 4+ to just two, one hard right and one hard left. I think more tracks "smooths out" the guitar tone; fewer lets the gritty aggressiveness of a given tone come through, to my ears.\u000a\u000aI'd suggest some changes to the overall mix as far as final product goes, but I am assuming this mix is designed to focus on the guitar tone, and it's cool for checking that out.

asVI was heavily inspired by Animals as Leaders when I wrote this song. Alex Sevigny - Transition State
p6461
(lp6462
Vsounds great man!
p6463
aVI'd love to hear you explain what makes this 'metal'.
p6464
aVIf Animals as Leaders and Polyphia are considered "metal" (although progressive metal) then this easily falls into the sane category, even if not as well preformed or written as those examples. Metal is a very broad genre that takes many forms.

asVCome rag on my guitar tone! Help me make it better!
p6466
(lp6467
VSounds okay, serviceable enough for the music, would be better to hear a straight guitar stem as certain areas it becomes to hard to tell if it's the bass or guitar on certain riffs. \u000a\u000aAs someone who plays a wide range of genres it's all about picking the right setup for the music in question. As I mentioned. The overall sound here works for the Metalcore type stuff. However I struggle to feel if it'd work with something like Doom or Black Metal. Where with Doom I'd add a bit more low end and a bit more fuzz whereas with BM I wouldn't tune down as low (7 string?), drop the low end, ramp up the gain and Reverb.\u000a\u000aI could go on and on. Bottom line. It sounds fine for what you're playing here.
p6468
aVI don't think a universal "perfect" metal tone exists for all styles...haha. Thanks for the input though. I wanted a pretty strong mid range, but I've been having trouble with the highs getting too strong and it getting screechy. 
p6469
aVit sounds good to me, definately a good tone for that type of music. 
p6470
aVThe tone is seriously heavy. I think if you tweak the EQ on one of them a little bit, it will provide better separation. There are some lower-register riffs that become a bit indistinct. I dig the tone of the cleaner guitar as is.\u000a\u000aPS: I read "Come rag" and thought /r/guitarcirclejerk. Freudian slip?\u000a\u000a
p6471
aVThat's actually a pretty good tone. What kind of hardware and settings/amp sims did you use to get this tone?
p6472
aVI don't think I can find a single thing wrong with the tone, it sounds great!\u000a\u000aWhat gear are you using?
p6473
aVClear and distinct tone - I like it - a lot. The low A notes have a good punch to them, and the highs are crystal clear. A little more work on the separation of the tracks would make them stand out even more, but damn, I just got to around 2:45 and that's some seriously heavy tone. What kind of EQ/amp simulation are you using?
p6474
asVHere's a drum cover I did of a Blotted Science song! Let me know what you think!
p6475
(lp6476
VI haven't even watched the video yet but I'm going to upvote you just for trying. That band is seriously fucking awesome and I love sitting down and trying to figure out his riffs on guitar, which usually involves a lot of counting.\u000aEdit: Just watched the video, great job!!
p6477
aVYea I had to listen to the song non stop for a few days to get it down, and I imagine the guitar riffs are just as hard if not worse to learn! thank you!
p6478
aVSome can be... But I feel that with polymetric riffs, sometimes if you just remember the notes and scale intervals and get the grooves down, you don't really have to think twice about playing them. I couldn't imagine doing that on the drums though, but I'm a total drum noob.
p6479
aVJeeze, time for me to go practice. You just make me feel bad. Lol. Great work!
p6480
aVThank you! Glad I could inspire you to go practice haha \u005cm/

aV[deleted]
p6494
aVCritique/feedback is appreciated.
p6495
aVMy main critique is that you need to turn the gain down and that the solo doesn't have any wah on it in the album. Very good solo though, it's just the wah and gain that make it sound muddy.

VNice, I feel the drums are on the weak side though. They need to sound like war drums. Could use a big ol verb on there too
p6500
aVYeah I see what you mean about the drums. The only thing is that they were programmed and at max volume already, so Im really not sure how to improve that.
p6501
aVThe drums sound weak because everything is mixed way too loud and it's brickwalled to shit. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRyIACDCc1I).
p6502
aVHmm thanks for the links, that was very helpful. Now I see what I can do to improve the sound. Thanks!
p6503
aVI still have to tell myself all the time not to worship the guitars in my guitar worship music.  9 times out of 10 I start with the guitars overpowering everything else.  Give stuff space and it'll do wonders.\u000a\u000aOverall though the music composition is great!  Vocals sit well.  Great job!  I'd buy this.  You need a new drummer :)  I don't know what you're using, but Jamstix is way underrated.\u000a\u000aI use Massey's Tape Head on drums to make them pop out of the mix, free to try, totally unlocked - you pay for the save button - it's worth it though.
p6504
aVI just use the midi drums that came with the Pro Tools SE. Its kind of the best I have at the moment but in a month I'll have access to a better interface and software so that'll help a lot. Thanks for the comment!
p6505
aVI wish I could give you my copy of strike, I don't use it anymore.  Have you considered "other means of access"? +wink+
p6506
aVUse a bit of reverb and compression to make the drums sound better.
p6507
aVI feel stoned after listening to it, im telling you, this is fucking awesome music with unexpected side effects ! Magical. Mysterious. Makes you feel stoned and then gives you a huge erection. (the lead part was fucking brilliant).

asVCan't afford studio monitors - any headphone recommendations for recording/mixing/etc?
p6521
(lp6522
VHey, I can actually make a solid recommendation! This must be my lucky week for posting here.\u000a\u000aI've got a pair of [AKG K240 mkII's](http://www.amazon.com/AKG-240-Stereo-Studio-Headphones/dp/B0016MNBAM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404779972&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=akg+k240) I love very much. I got them at a good deal on Amazon when I ordered the old version and they sent me the new version either by accident or through trying to phase out the old version. In short, they sound fantastic. They're pretty flat in terms of frequency response, but being over-ear they still have pretty deep-sounding bass. I've found them really nice for recording and mixing. \u000a\u000aThe only downside I can think of is they can get pretty uncomfortable over long periods of time, but this is definitely a personal thing, as I have pretty weird-shaped ears that have bits of flesh sticking out everywhere. \u000a\u000aIf you can't afford the the $110ish pricetag (I couldn't when I got them), it appears Amazon still sells the original version for around $70. They are (according to what I've read) almost exactly the same headphones in terms of drivers/construction, just with less padding and fewer accessories (the mkII's come with a second replaceable cable, a different set of ear pads, and an 1/8" to 1/4" adapter). I have no doubt these would also be an excellent investment if they in fact are the same headphones as the ones I own. [Here](http://www.amazon.com/AKG-240-Semi-Open-Studio-Headphones/dp/B0001ARCFA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404784788&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=akg+k240) are the originals.\u000a\u000aHope this helps!\u000a
p6523
aVThat is a great recommendation. I've been reading about other headphones and they're all closed-back. The older version of the headphones you linked are semi-open. Are the MK II's semi-open as well and is that a game changer?
p6524
aVYep, both models are semi-open.\u000a\u000aI'm not really sure what "semi-open" means in comparison to "closed" and "fully-open" headphone designs, all the research I've done on the topic points to it being a marketing term with little meaning. Not sure if this is true. Essentially, from what I can tell, "open design" just means that there's some ventilation on the outside that allows air through the headphones, apparently giving the appearance that the sound is coming from an outside source. "Closed" are obviously closed-back and allow no air through. This apparently allows for more present bass etc., but you can get an "inside-the-head" effect making the sound appear too close to you. "Semi-open" is an attempt to compromise.  \u000a\u000aYou might already know all this, I'm mostly typing it for myself because some of this new to me. Is it a game-changer for the k-240's? Nah, I don't think so. I suppose you can't go wrong with something that's supposed to be the best of two worlds. Just be aware that the semi-open design will offer less noise cancellation and leak more sound than a closed one, so if you're worried about bothering the people around you with noise coming out of your headphones, or work in a loud environment, a closed design (or some in-ear monitors) might be a better choice for you. I personally work well away from others, so it's not a problem in my case.
p6525
aVI've got these headphones as well and LOVE them. Something to note, though, is that you'll get WAY better results out of them by \u000a\u000a1) Burning them in properly. Every night for a week or two put on pink noise at the upper limit for comfortable listening volume and let it go all night. Looking for about 100+ total hours or so, and \u000a\u000a2) Get a cmoy amp to feed them more power unless whatever you're feeding them with provides a very strong signal. They sound pathetic when hooked up to underpowered sources like a phone (or at least my phone) and sound killer when run off of my bass amp (though they were not so stellar before the burn-in)\u000a\u000aAs for the semi-open status, they sound super open and flat; they reproduce whatever you put into them without exaggerating anything or making it sound all boomy and squishy. Also, you can hear everything around you quite clearly, so they are not at all good for isolation.\u000a\u000aAlso, the headphone amp is really awesome if you listen to music in the car through the auxiliary channel. You get way more clarity and power at the same volume levels and it seems to hold stable at much higher volume levels. I'm not sure about the other op-amps, but I've got an 18v one with a JRC4556 and super highly recommend it.\u000a
p6526
aVThanks for this. I actually ordered these ones last night and just got a text saying that they'll be delivered today. I'm looking forward to trying them when I get home. \u000a\u000a1) Thank you in particular for bringing up burn-in. I haven't come across anyone recommending that process on any of the forums I've been on. I'll make sure to do that. I'll probably just find an .mp3 of "pink noise" and let it sit.\u000a2) Is a cmoy amp the same thing as a regular headphone amp? Because most of the time I'm going to be running these through a Samson C-que8
p6527
aVThere seems to be some debate as to how much or even if burn-in is a thing, but anecdotally, I definitely noticed a substantial difference in how strongly bass and cleanly was reproduced and overall volume handling at any frequency. I'd say it's totally worth it. For my burn in I just downloaded one of those sleep sounds apps that had a pink noise module and played it through my phone while I slept.\u000a\u000aAnd yep, cmoy amp has become a generic name for a diy headphone amp. I recommended one specifically as opposed to saying a headphone amp as you can usually buy well built ones on ebay or etsy for like $50 bucks, which I understand is way cheaper than most headphone amps. Also, they are super portable and can be used for any time you need better results out of low output devices or not particularly efficient headphones or desktop speakers.\u000a\u000aAlso, you can often customize the build of the device, depending on the builder. I've seen ones that have multiple outs, can be plugged in or battery powered, and even with various eq controls.\u000a\u000aAnd on top of all that, people are always interested in why your headphones are plugged into a penguin mints tin and always blown away when they plug their own headphones into it and hear the difference :) Makes an instant lil jon out of most folks: "Hhhhwhat?!"
p6528
aVI've got a pair of those that I've used almost every day for about 5 and a half years for general music listening. What they lack in bass is sheer clarity. Phenomenal headphones and I recommend them to anyone.
p6529
aVSennheiser HD 280 Pro. You can get them cheap and they sound great. 
p6530
aVI use Beyerdynamic DT-770 pro's.  Excellent headphones, deep bottom end, I use them to mix bass because my monitors won't show a lot of bass.  A little more than the other suggestions, but less than the price of a single good monitor.  Can't go wrong with those.
p6531
aVHm. I just looked these up on Amazon and it shows 250, 32 and 80 Ohm versions of this model. I'm new to this and not sure what the difference would be especially for the cost involved. I'd be plugging these in to a [Samson C-que8 headphone amp](http://www.amazon.com/Samson-C-que8-4-Channel-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B0002I9S12/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404784670&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=samson+c+que) most of the time. 
p6532
aVI use the 80 ohm, and I think the difference is that the 250's need to be used with a headphone amp and the 80s don't.  With proper amping the 250 and 80 should be the same (the 250s are built for amping, and they may sound better than the 80 amp'd).  However, if you plug your 250s directly into your laptop they may sound lifeless and flat.  I use the 80s and they work well in everything.
p6533
aVYou can't go wrong with a pair of these:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B003LPTAYI?cache=d733496d13fd2dc564ded12a3116bf27&amp;pi=SY200_QL40&amp;qid=1404779906&amp;sr=8-2#ref=mp_s_a_1_2\u000a\u000aHonestly anything made by  Sennheiser is a good choice. Just make sure to check the specs, 60hz is all you really need for low end, everything below that just messes up the mix anyways. You can also find cheap speakers and a mini sub for cheap (40$ or so). It's always a good idea to have multiple speakers so you can hear it on multiple different platforms. 
p6534
aVI've read nothing but good things about Sennheiser. I'm just a little skeptical over spending $22 for some headphones even though this got stellar reviews. I'm not bitching about the price but I'm just afraid "you get what you pay for," ya know? 
p6535
aVI completely understand, I bought mine 2 years ago and haven't had a single problem. I've beaten them to hell and without doubt they are the best pair I've ever owned. My step mother has beats headphones, and these are far superior without the stupid price. I actually had a pair of high end Bose headphones that I traded in and ended up buying these. \u000a\u000aI can only imagine that buying a more expensive pair would sound even better, but these are incredible themselves. 
p6536
aVMy pair just arrived today, they are easily comparable to my friends £100 headphones. and hey they are cheap, worst case is you waste a pretty small amount of money (even though you can just sell them again on ebay and get ya money back).
p6537
aVOther users have pointed out fantastic headphones. But when you're specifically mixing and mastering, I prefer shitty $10 headphones. Why? Because if it sounds good on those then it sure as hell will sound good on a good pair of headphones.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I definitely recommend listening on both.

sVOriginal Song (No vocals) Anyone care to critique?
p6541
(lp6542
VWhat I liked: I really like that dirty riff after the intro at around 1:10.  It gets real mean around 3:20 as well.  Probably my favorite parts of the track.  \u000a\u000aWhat I didn't really enjoy: The slower riffs aren't really my cup of tea, and the outro part kind of seems to go on a bit too long without really doing much of anything.  \u000a\u000aI'd be interested in hearing the other 3 tracks if/when you have them recorded.\u000a\u000aAlso, props for tagging it as ultra-blast-neo-pop-cereal-core. 
p6543
aVThanks for the feedback. The slower parts just fit my taste, I think. I like big, layered chords to break up the riffing. I'm planning the other songs to be more riff-based, though.\u000a\u000aAs for the outro part I agree that is goes on long. However, that part is there as more of a thematic decision as I want the EP to end with a feeling of uncertainty and apprehension, and I think having it go on a little too long heightens that. It might make more sense once there's vocals, but I may decide to shorten it later.\u000a\u000aAgain thanks for the feedback, and I also feel more motivated to get this thing finished now that I know someone wants to hear it, so thanks for that too.
p6544
aVI used to be huge into djent. Not so much anymore, but it still has a small place in the back of my mind.\u000a\u000aanywho\u000a\u000agood song man. I liked how you didn't just fall back to the 'breakdown style' of drums during the riff at 1:10. for a song that was recorded using programs, it sounds better than any of the songs my friend and I made through programs so good on you for that one. also good work with some of the fades on the drums. a small problem I have with that is it isn't necessarily realistic. it is difficult to have that much control of a crescendo on a cymbal (at least for me I guess) and I've never really been a fan of the edited instruments unless it is a full band fade like you did at the end, which was cool.
p6545
aVI'm glad you liked it. Is there somewhere I can listen to anything you've made?\u000a\u000aEdit: It seems like clicking on your name was a good idea. I'll listen to your stuff when I'm not on my phone.

p6557
aVSo it's a rocksmith software thing ? I guess it's more than a cable, there must be a tiny USB interface in there (given the little I know about computer devices and the price of that... thing).\u000aI would be interested to know more.
p6558
aVBasically, it's a USB adapter for a guitar. This way, you're plugging your guitar directly into your computer's sound card. It's a cheap, easy way to record guitars, but you will not get as good a sound as you would with an interface.

(lp6586
VWhat I learned while writing and recording for my post-metal band:\u000a\u000a#1 Expensive equipment will neither improve your guitar playing, nor your mixing skills. Go with the cheap DAWs (reaper?), Audiointerface(Line 6 Guitar Port?), Plugins(Lepou guitaramps),etc. You don't have the knowledge to handle the expensive ones worth their cost, because you don't understand shit. \u000a\u000a#2 Watching every mixing Tutorial there is won't improve your mixing. Mixing is not something you have to know, but to practice. These are some mixing youtube-channels I love:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/user/recordingrevolution\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/user/PensadosPlace\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/user/MojoJojo378\u000a\u000aI used to spend hours watching tutorials on how side-chain compression works but hat no ear to eq a simple bassguitar.\u000aYou don't want to hear this, but:\u000a\u000a#3 No theoretical input will compensate for the lack of practice and the work to overcome it. You have a fucking long way to go, if you are at the very beginning of it all. \u000aI record/mix nearly everyday for 3.5 years now and [this](https://soundcloud.com/infold/zach-braff-is-longing-for-love) is the latest mix I uploaded, wich is not more than okay. You may be quicker than I am, but If you want to be world famous tomorrow, bury the dream, because this mindsetting only will get you frustrated ;D\u000a\u000a[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9KwjQd2XpY&amp;list=PL4oqgoHZcg_KDXKZyEG4QlDs_jNp6oObq) is my post metal band, everything is bedroom recording. Check it out, if you have questions regarding the sounds I used etc., I may be able to answer more specific.
p6587
aVI don't wanna offend you, or anyone else, but you seem to be projecting, and quite a lot. I've worked on pro audio for many years. Trust me, an 'okay' mix absolutely doesn't take 3.5 years of practice. Even people who are relatively slow can usually churn out good mixes after a single year of good practice, assuming they're willing to learn. Mastering is different, but the genre OP's interested in doesn't require any serious mastering. If you can't do a professional-sounding mix with proper equipment after 3.5 years of practice, chances are you're either missing the fundamentals or have some really bad habits. The tried and trusted way of fixing this is interning for a studio for a couple of months. \u000a\u000aAs for not needing expensive equipment because of not understanding shit, well, exactly what are you supposed to understand about a treated room and a nice pair of monitors before you can benefit from them? Sure, OP won't need a super-expensive analogue multiband compressor, but there certainly is some mid and high end stuff that can make his life easier. Examples would be an audio interface with enough inputs to track a drumkit+room live, or an isolation cabinet for peaceful experimentation with high gain, or a proper keyboard with good sounds that will save him hours of traversing through sample banks and libraries for high-quality sounds that sit well together.\u000a\u000aAnd besides, we're talking about atmospheric black metal, a genre which is easier to mix than pretty much anything else excluding solo instruments. OP can realistically start writing his music and practicing mixing and recording now and end up with an album with the same quality as what he linked in an year, and from his post it seems like that's the goal. You're making it sound like he said he was expecting to fill up a stadium with groupies while Miss America administers heroin up his balls on the stage by the end of the month.
p6588
aVI think you are the one projecting, regarding the fact that he, untill now, just expressed his wish to record. From what i got, he is right in the beginning of both guitar and mixing.  Why would he need a 8canal Interface and highend monitors? To sell them when he might be frustrated in a year? Or to track a drumkit he doesn't possess? He is just getting started, so he shouldn't spend a shitload of money on hardware, especialy for a bm production that defines its sound by the poorest recording quality possible. On the other hand, all these delay and reverbclouds are pretty hard to handle in a Mix, and this needs ear and practice. 
p6589
aVSaying that he won't need some gear because he might just drop the project is very condescending. OP clearly stated that producing an ambient black metal album is his dream, and asked for advice. There's no room in there for "yeah, don't buy expensive shit because you'll regret it when you decide to drop the project".\u000a\u000aAs for the 8 channel interface, well, most ambient metal projects track their drums live instead of using samples, so I assumed OP was going to do the same. I'll admit there's no need for that if he's doing it with virtual drums, but nowhere did he mention he's gonna do that. As for the monitors, it will save him hours of cross-referencing material between several pairs of headphones and speakers just to check how well his mix transitions, and he'll be able to spend those hours on improving his skills.\u000a\u000aFinally, concerning the black metal recording traditions, well, that's just not true. Ambient black metal is notorious for almost being able to mix itself. Leviathan's first album was recorded with on a 4-track tape with vocals and guitars going through very simple analogue signal chains, without any mixing, and the only defect it has is that drums are *slightly* too harsh. Everything else fits perfectly into its atmosphere. Stacked reverb and delay units oftentimes tend to fall well together when the entire thing is distorted, especially when said distortion is on analogue tape. But the gear used for recording was by no means lo-fi: the instruments were all good, the mics were great, and the space was well-treated. The first step was to create an environment in which creating such music was possible. You cannot add those things during mixing. You could try with some very specialized plugins and outboard gear, but those would end up costing much more than just getting good recording conditions from the beginning.
p6590
aVYou are right,it sounds condescending, but it wasn't ment to. I just wanted to stress one point but couldn't make it clear: Something like "with great expenses comes great responsibilty" - I myself was more confident in what I do, when my equipment was in propotion to my skills and i felt like I was in control of all the buttons there are. And maybe that was projection.. Either way, that doesn't really matter in regard of the monitors. When I would start from scratch to play/record, high expenses would put a lot of pressure to me and I would be more occupied to discover some features of gear and software, than to experiment with eq or simple compression. But if that doesn't count for OP, he may well-advised with your recommendation.
p6591
aV[Another Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEjOdqZFvhY&amp;feature=youtu.be) about mixing in general
p6592
aVNEEDED: guitar, mic for vocals/etc., good computer, audio interface, DAW, good headphones or speakers for monitors, skill to play accurately with a click, ideas, time.\u000a\u000aGOOD BUT OPTIONAL: bass guitar, keyboard, drumkit, studio space, more mics. \u000a\u000aAssuming you have a guitar, computer, and speakers (maybe not that great).  You will need to start putting together a recording setup.  And start recording!  Don't expect your first stuff to be mind-blowing.  Just make music and don't get too hung up on one idea.

aVHey dude,\u000a\u000aI liked the song and honestly, it's fantastic. Ambient Black Metal should sound like what you have, in my opinion, because it's raw. It's not supposed to sound over-produced like a lot of stuff lately.\u000a\u000aYou don't need technical skills either. I wrote an [entire album](http://lordkrehn.bandcamp.com/album/e-volve?from=search&amp;search_item_id=1387195003&amp;search_item_type=a&amp;search_match_part=%3F&amp;search_page_id=13862820&amp;search_rank=2&amp;search_sig=db9c03ad7b1ad0eeb99c05aa604236cd) with shitty skills on guitar and keyboards. Since you're doing black metal, just learn alternative picking and power chords. \u000a\u000aI also recommend looking at guitar tabs for your favorite bands. [Tuxguitar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/) is free and will allow you to read Guitar Pro tabs, which are honestly the best out there. Just google something like "Carpathian guitar pro tabs" and you're set.\u000a\u000a/u/paganrae offers good advice, but I think it would help us understand exactly what you want before we could help you. \u000a\u000a[This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaIvzbV40MM&amp;index=27&amp;list=PL69CCCD0075CF5F1F) is decent for EQing drums. Honestly, you just gotta play with everything until you get the sound you like, but this video will give you a start.\u000a\u000aMy entire setup was relatively simple:\u000a\u000a* [Fast-Track Audio interface](http://www.amazon.com/M-Audio-Fast-Track-USB-Interface/dp/B002QZ402Q), but mine is much older\u000a* [AKG D5](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/D5) microphone with pop-filter.\u000a* Behringer Midi controller (keyboard that plugs into a computer)\u000a* BC Rich guitar\u000a* Ibanez Bass guitar (borrowed)\u000a* While I'm a good drummer, I didn't record with my drumset for this album\u000a\u000aThen software:\u000a\u000a* [Acid Pro](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ACIDPro7), but any software is good \u000a* [Amplitube 3](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/AmpliTube3e) for guitars, but a variety free ones exist too\u000a* [EZDrummer](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/SupDrum2)\u000a* [Atmosphere VST](http://www.kvraudio.com/product/atmosphere_by_spectrasonics/details)\u000a* [Magnus Choir](http://syntheway.com/choir.htm) for choir\u000a* [Various U-he](http://www.u-he.com/cms/zebra) plugins\u000a* And for mixing I used [Adobe Audition](https://creative.adobe.com/products/audition) because Sony Pro sucks at it\u000a\u000a\u000a**Song writing:** \u000a\u000a1. While song writing, I work around a riff I really like so I find the tempo of that riff first. \u000a2. Then in Sony Acid I setup the metronome and record that riff. \u000a3. I build riffs around that main riff. If I need to change tempo for those parts then I'll mark it in Sony and it will adjust the metronome\u000a4. After all of this, I'll add drum segments (copy/paste with EZDrummer)\u000a5. Then I'll record the entire song in one track\u000a6. Record the entire song in another track (usually lead part here since I write melody first)\u000a7. Rewrite drums with fills, changes, etc. so it's not dull\u000a8. Write keyboard parts\u000a9. Export everything to wav files\u000a10. Import everything to Adobe Audition\u000a11. Add vocals\u000a12. Mix everything and add final touches\u000a\u000aI don't know if this helped at all, but I hope it did. The best advice is to just keep doing it. 
p6597
aVwow man, thanks! You seem like a really nice dude. Your comment was exactly what I was hoping for. Helps a lot! Glad that you took the time to listen to the song and also like it :)
p6598
aVHardware:  I do solo recordings with a 4 track recorder.  It allows you to split up all the instrument parts by recording them individually.  The Tascam ones are decent enough.  6 and 8 track is more channels (more parts to layer) and better options but the 4 can get it done.\u000a\u000aTips, etc:  play every day, even when you don't want to.  Make sure you can play any riff at a slow tempo before trying to play it at speed.  This is especially helpful for more challenging parts.  Master it slow, then speed it up bit by bit.\u000a\u000aGeneral guitar playing tips:  Again, play every day.  Play with other musicians every chance you get.  Learn to play things you hear without having to refer to tabs or whatnot.  Don't limit yourself to learning only metal, inspiration can come from anywhere.  Inspiration doesn't even have to come from music or theory at all (very little of mine does actually)  Guitar is a skill set that has no ceiling, something you can never stop improving at.  And the only serious way to improve is to put in the hours every day.
p6599
aVthank you for the advice. I have a question, you mentioned learning by hearing and not referring to tabs etc, how do i start with that? i mean i have a good ear for instruments and music i'd say but i don't know how to transfer this onto my fretboard :(
p6600
aVThere is probably a more scholarly method but this is how I started to do this.\u000a\u000aTake it one note at a time.  Take a guess at where that 1st note might be on the fret board.  Keep guessing until you find the right one (this gets easier very quickly the more you practice).  Rewind the song or riff or part 20 times if you have to.  Usually the following notes will be nearby.  \u000a\u000aIf you can sing or hum then hum the note right when you hear it and match the pitch.  Then keep humming while you try to place the note on the fret board.\u000a\u000aWrite down each note as you find it in whatever notation works for you (tab is fine) this is so you don't forget it while you progress further.
p6601
aVcan you really be a musician without knowing "proper" notes? 
p6602
aVIf you can express your emotions through an instrument then you are a musician.  Regardless of how you got to that point.\u000a\u000aBut on the topic of theory.  Learning scales and chords helps you piece together songs very quickly.  When you are guessing what notes are being played you can take more accurate guesses within the scale you hear the music being played in.
p6603
aVI understand. Any advice on learning scales and chords? Most google search results are monetized links which dont get you anywhere I think
p6604
aV[deleted]
p6605
aVIt's gonna be tough because you need to be good at writing for a bunch of different instruments (guitars, synths, vocals, drums), and you have to play or program them all in, and you need the hardware and software to do it with. Then you need the skill to mix it all. So you should expect to set aside a lot of time, and dedicate much of that to learning and experimentation.\u000a\u000aIt would take forever to explain every aspect of it, so probably the best thing for you is to get a DAW (as mentioned by other commenters), work out the best way of getting your guitar recorded (direct input + software amp vs hardware amp + microphone, for example), pick a way to program drums (EZDrummer is a good starting point), and just get started. Come back when you have specific questions.\u000a\u000aObligatory plug, since this is Relevant: [Arx Atrata - Through Dying Lands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xHtfKguY1Q) (follow on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArxAtrata) if you like it!)\u000a\u000a
p6606
aVwhat does DAW mean?
p6607
aVDid you Google it like the other guy suggested? You need to get good at finding info for yourself.
p6608
aVI have an atmospheric black metal project myself ([Hyperborean Skies](https://hyperboreanskies.bandcamp.com), maybe you've seen me post on here). I started out knowing absolutely nothing just a few months ago, and I feel like I have improved immensely.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, invest in a DAW. It can be a cheap one (like Reaper) or a more expensive one (like Pro Tools). You will just have to try out the free trials on different programs to find which ones you like best. I am currently using Logic because it comes with a TON of MIDI libraries, and I don't have any better drum sounds yet.\u000a\u000aNext, you need some method to record. I use a Line 6 POD X3, and I absolutely love it. It has dozens, if not hundreds, of built in amps, as well as several vocal effects. It is also completely digital, meaning you do not need a mic for the guitars. You can just connect it directly to your computer to record.\u000a\u000aFor vocals, anything will do really if you have a quiet space you can record in.\u000a\u000aAs for mixing, the best teacher is experience. You will learn much more by playing with it than watching tutorials. There are a few things to keep in mind though. This type of metal often has many layered guitar tracks to create that cloudy texture. I use four guitar tracks: one panned all the way left, one all the way right, one slightly left, and one slightly right. And vocals, don't mix them too loud. They are typically behind the mix with some reverb to create a distant sound, rather than in your face.
p6609
aVYeah, i actually stumbled across your Music Project a few weeks ago. I really enjoyed the Sharp and Raw Sounding Guitars, combined with these sick drums..

aVi'm in fayetteville, AR. i've been screaming for a while now, but i can't play any instruments. i'm also into the subset of metal you like, if my genre depictions are right, lamb of god is a groove metal band? because they are one of my favorites. i'm not sure what we could do so far away, but if you happen to complete a song, i'd be happy to lay whatever vocals you want on them, whether they be your lyrics or mine.

p6654
aVkeep at it, i followed ya (I'm Proxima Control)
p6655
aVThanks for the follow.
p6656
aVLook, we all know there's a huge difference between just insulting someone, and critiquing them, but who knows maybe I am being a dick when I say... I honestly think there was almost nothing good about that track. The idea itself for the song, yes I can see it becoming something good, but I mean A LOT of work would need to be done. \u000a\u000aThe guitars are sloppy, the vocals have little to no effort put into them, and what the hell is going on with that ridiculously loud hi-hat? I'm really trying to critique and not insult, and that's why I say again, with TONS of work, that could be made into a worth while song.
p6657
aVThanks for your feedback.\u000a\u000aWe don't have a proper microphone to record, so I was uncomfortable with singing very loudly (the lead track clipped at some point as it is). That's next on our priorities, as well as a better place to record.\u000a\u000aThe guitarist had a few mess-ups, sure. It's a demo.\u000a\u000aI have no idea what is up with that damned hi-hat. I didn't even notice it until people started pointing it out, and now I don't know how I missed it before. For what it's worth it's a drum machine, so I should be able to fix it in future demos.\u000a\u000aThere is also a lot more intended to be in this song, but later sections rely on having a real drummer, which we don't have right now.
p6658
aVGee, a rough mix needs a lot of work?  Who would have thought.  What you address are valid concerns to be sure.  Obviously these guys don't think the song is finished by any means.  That doesn't mean that they need comments like yours.  You're not the one who came here looking for criticism, but seriously man, it would do well to remember the first part of "constructive criticism."  Maybe I'm no better than you when I say that the way you phrased that came off sounding far more like an insufferable cunt than it did actual advice, but this is an internet forum for advice.  Take a chill pill.  In the immortal words of the dude, "You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."
p6659
aVThe reason it's called "constructive" criticism, is because it should be harsh enough to get the person to work harder. Saying "yeah this is pretty good, just needs a little work" isn't going to drive anyone to be better.\u000a\u000aWe need to stop telling all our children that they won the soccer game, even if they weren't keeping track of the points. We need to stop giving EVERYONE a trophy no matter how good/shitty they are at what they're doing. Sometimes the bad guy is the guy that makes the good guy look at himself and say "I need to get better"
p6660
aVYeah, but seriously man, "almost nothing about this song is any good at all" sounds a lot worse than "yeah, this certainly is pretty rough, you need a lot of work."  Like I said, you aren't wrong, but telling someone they suck, no matter how it is phrased, is not the same thing as telling them they need improvement.  It's an argument on the internet, so I'm not gonna bother wasting any more time on it, but next time do consider what you're saying at least a little bit more before you say it.
p6661
aVI never said the words "you suck"!!.. You can disagree with me, but don't make shit up.
p6662
aVI never said that you did. I just stated that if you wanted to tell someone that they need improvement, you don't do so by first insulting them.
p6663
aVIt's not even an insult. It's the truth, and that's what he needs to hear.\u000a\u000aAn insult would be: "Dude, you suck, stop making music and go graduate college with a degree in something useful."

p6722
aVI definitely agree that the cymbal needs to come down in volume. I also think having guitars panned a little more to the left or right might help with clarity.

aVThis is kick-ass. I love the thundering low notes. I personally don't think the cymbals are too much, but that's just me - I do the same thing you do for drums but in Ableton with Implulse. What guitar/string gauge/tuning are you using here?
p6725
aVThanks. I've been messing around with the cymbals forever and it just boils down to I don't have the right soundset. I need to invest in a metal pack for SD2... Anyways the guitar is a (lovely) Carvin DC800, the strings are Circle K 10-76 balanced, and the tuning is halfstep down (FBbEbAbDbGbBbEb), though every low note you hear is a G, or the second fret on the eighth string.

VI'm no vocalist, but from being in a band a long time ago that had a very talented vocalist, you shouldn't be using your throat. \u000a\u000aYou gotta use more of your diaphragm and push more with your gut to get a loud scream that isn't going to tear your throat up. Using the mucus in your throat doesn't sound like a reliable technique. It has to come from deeper in your chest to get the projection you're looking for without hurting yourself. \u000a\u000aSorry I can't give better advice because I can't do it myself, but maybe you should look into the video called The Zen of Screaming. I know people that used that and it made their vocals 100x than they were before. \u000a\u000aEdit: here's a link to what I'm talking about.

p6774
(lp6775
VNot sure how much you paid for it but the JP Ibanez tends to shift for around the $2,000-2,500 region. That is the JP2. \u000a\u000aI'm guessing you have the JPM90HAM with the "unstandard" colour finish?\u000a\u000aIs it actually signed by him or does it just have his signature on the back of the headstock which comes as standard on them?\u000a\u000aNot sure how much value the signature will add. Maybe around $500 at most, bring you up to $3,000.\u000a\u000aSource: Massive DT fan and collector. 
p6776
aVThanks very much for the info! Yes, it's the JPM90HAM with the blue-tint finish. I had him autograph it at the National Guitar Summer Workshop in CT (RIP) in the late 90s. I went up to him with it and he said "Wow, these are rare, I don't think I even have one of them" (there's something like 800 of them worldwide). With my slyest smirk, I give him "Yeah, well, I hear the guy who plays these is pretty good." Stone face. Man, I am not good around idols.
p6777
aVYeah, I was the same when I met him. The guy is a hero of mine. \u000a\u000aAlways came across as really gracious and humble though, which was nice. \u000a\u000aYou might be able to get a better price than what I said but that is roughly your going average to it should at least give you a bit of a base to work from. 
p6778
aVAbsolutely (and I didn't mean to imply that he wasn't a great dude - more that i fell about 20 miles onto my face with that swing-and-a-miss). \u000a\u000aThanks again for the help - I'll keep your notes in mind!

(lp6782
sVAny advice on recording and mixing/mastering death metal vocals?
p6783
(lp6784
VGet a decent mic if you can, and try different ones if possible. (Shure SM7B is often used.) A pop shield will help as there is likely to be a lot of air moving. Record in a proper vocal booth if you can, but if not, make sure you find a room with as little reverb as possible. Cover solid surfaces with soft fabrics, close any curtains, and secure any loose or rattling objects. You want to be able to clap loudly and not hear any weird ringing or rattling. Buy or borrow a [Reflexion shield](http://www.seelectronics.com/rf-pro) or equivalent.\u000a\u000aGet the vocalist to do their loudest roar to begin with so you can set your levels adequately to avoid clipping. Record as normal. Listen closely during tracking to make sure the takes have as much (or as little) enunciation as you need. Track each part a few times so that you can double-track if you like. Make sure the vocalist is consistent with their delivery timing. If a whole verse or chorus requires the vocalist to gasp between lines, consider having them deliver alternate lines during recording (eg. lines 1 and 3 first, then 2 and 4 on the next take).\u000a\u000aHigh-pass the track to make it sit in the mix better. If your mic or interface has a high pass filter available during recording, engage that. Use a noise gate to cut noisy silences between phrases, but be careful not to have it pump on breathing or the start of a word. If you're not confident about getting that right, just cut the vocal manually in your DAW later. Consider using a de-esser, but listen carefully to make sure it doesn't give the vocalist a lisp. You might prefer to do manual de-essing with gain automation or spot EQ.\u000a\u000aCompress it heavily to make it of a more consistent volume afterwards. (Automate the gain first if some sections are significantly quieter than others.) 2 compressors in serial can work well, as can 2 in parallel if you have one for the fundamental frequencies and one for the high frequencies. Consider a high shelf EQ if you need a bit more clarity and get the vox coming through the mix.\u000a\u000aConsider sending the vocal to a reverb bus, but be careful not to overdo it. Delay can work too, if synced to the tempo, and if you put the effort in to duck it during the phrases and only really 'breathe' between them.\u000a\u000aExample of a death metal vocal I recorded myself for our band following the above advice: http://twilightsembrace.bandcamp.com/track/ego-trip
p6785
aVThis pretty much hits about everything you need to know on the head. The SM7B is about the best mic for this application in my opinion. \u000a\u000aThe only other thing that I do sometimes based on the situation is create a copy of the track, pitch it up and down slightly and then compress the shit out of it. Slight verb (something to delay it slighly behind) and then bring it up very slowly in the mix until you can barely hear it. Adds some great depth. Also with this trick I like to dump whatever EQ the singer has naturally a lot of and boost the ones that need help (like -db's at 500 and 1.5k and a boost at 750 ect).

aVIt's the noise of the pick hitting the strings.\u000a\u000aHere are some suggestions on how to avoid it: http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/624/how-can-i-prevent-the-noise-my-guitar-pick-makes\u000a\u000aOn the mix, you can look for the frequency where that noise is and equalize it out. There will always be some pick noise, you can only minimize it.\u000a\u000aAlso, I've noted that the bridge pickup tends to catch this sound more than the neck pickup. Where you hit the string with the pick also impacts this (near the bridge will give you more pick sound).

If that was really created 15 days ago compared to now, your production skills have also increased a ton in a very short time period. Either way, you're very talented. Keep at it!
p6816
aVThank you, I appreciate the feedback! And yeah, if it was the 'progmetal' song you were listening to, I was using superior drummer 2.0 which I'm still new to and it's harder to get a good sound out of. I also just started messing with Ozone for mastering on these last two tracks, so they're much louder as well. Thanks again!
p6817
aVNice. I'm a thrash guy myself, but I haven't gotten a kickass tone like that. How'd you get such a tone?
p6818
aVI'm using a POD HD500 for the guitar tone, and the bass is programmed in Trilian. \u000a\u000aThe patch on the POD is a combo of the JCM800 (for an aggressive midrange) and Fireball (for brutal distortion) amp models. Then there's an overdrive and noise suppressor in front. In my DAW I high-passed the guitars to around 80-100Hz. There might be another noise suppressor at the end of the chain, and I think there's an additional EQ in the amps' FX loop. \u000a\u000aThe bass has a lot to do with it as well. Like I said before, I'm using Trilian and the "picked bass" samples. I put some distortion on it using the free TSE Audio BOD bass overdrive (TSE makes some badass free VSTs, would recommend for sure). The mids are pushed up a good amount, as well are the bass frequencies around 80-100Hz. \u000a\u000aThen in Ozone, I set the 'harmonic exciter' to around 60-70% and that seemed to add a lot of depth to the bass sound as well. \u000a\u000aHope that helps some!
p6819
aVYeah, that definitely helps. Wish I had the money for a POD 500. \u000a\u000aRight now, though, I've got a single POD Studio GX running into a Mac, with my guitar running into the GX. I've got a decent thrash tone (TSE 808 + Nick Crow 8505 + Poulin LeCab v2), but I can't seem to get the fuzziness out of my tone. Would you recommend using a DI box to smoothen the tone?
p6820
aVI don't really have any experience with DI boxes, so I wouldn't want to recommend anything and not have it work. \u000a\u000aOnly thing I could really suggest would be to try some different EQ techniques, hi/low-pass filters, surgical cuts to hi-mids... And just keep fiddling with the amp and overdrive settings. The TSE X50 is also another 5150 modeled amp that's free and sounds good, with the other VSTs you have I'd guess you've probably used it though.

VAs a huge fan of traditional crossover/thrash, as well as the NWOTM, I really enjoyed this.\u000a\u000aThe only opinion that could be considered "negative" that I have is that something about the recorded guitar tone isn't setting well with me, as if you need to turn the mids or highs up just bit more. Perhaps in the mastering of the audio. Hopefully that makes sense. The riffs simple in some parts, but groovy overall. They just need to *pop* out a bit more.\u000a\u000aI'm not into audio engineering so I'm not sure how that would work.\u000a\u000aJust my two cents. Keep up the good stuff. From now on, I'll be watching...

sVCould I feasibly record an atmospheric black metal album using just a guitar, a mic, and GarageBand?
p6837
(lp6838
VI recorded this [BM tune](http://pariahva.bandcamp.com/) solely on my ipad in the Garageband app. 
p6839
aVIf you hadn't told me you recorded that on an iPad, I would have never even guessed that was made that way. If an iPad can do that, I'm sure my Mac is totally capable of it too.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd that's a pretty good tune, by the way.
p6840
aVYou can, certainly. It requires some software and lots of know-how to sound decent, but it can be done. \u000a\u000aDownside: Good drum samples aren't free, and I haven't yet heard a MIDI bass that sounds like a real electric bass. And without a MIDI keyboard or controller of some kind, you are going to create hours of manual editing a piano roll to create your MIDI data.\u000a\u000aIf the material's good, you can also get people to collaborate either locally or online to fill in the missing instruments.
p6841
aV&gt; and I haven't yet heard a MIDI bass that sounds like a real electric bass. \u000a\u000aGuitar Pro's RSE is decent enough. Drums are crap due to their attempt to "humanize" which make EQ hard as shit to work with.
p6842
aVMy RSE drums are a bit dodgy, they play out of time. Do you know how to fix this?
p6843
aVDouble click on the Drum Kit, then take the "Human Playing" slider all the way down to 0%
p6844
aVYou can find Andy Sheap's drum samples on the web for free and I believe that they're pretty decent samples. There's also a sample kit by the name of "Erkan's Organized Sample Pack" that contains the Sheap samples and some other good samples. You could probably find them with a quick Google search.
p6845
aVCould record the 'bass' on guitar and octave down in Garageband (I assume this is possible, I've never used that particular software).  Again not ideal but better than midi.\u000a\u000aOr even a cheap second hand bass would probably be OK.  A couple of my mates have done this for messing around at home and it's definitely passable.
p6846
aVI do that in reaper, i record the bassline with my stratocaster and a clean sound and then just lower the pitch one octave. Not beautiful, but it works.
p6847
aVGo for it! There's a lot of great black metal out there that was recorded under less-than-ideal conditions.
p6848
aVYes. It's cheesey to make the quality sound bad on purpose, but if the lofi produciton is genuine, black metal is black metal.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I did my demos with a guitar, amp, mic (I recorded my guitars analog as opposed to DI) and believe it or not, fucking Guitar Pro for the drums\u000a\u000ahttps://soundcloud.com/brianjleong
p6849
aVDrums really don't sound too bad. Did you mess around with volume and stuff on different hits to make it sound marginally more realistic and accent the beats?
p6850
aVNo actually, the variation between drum hits is built in to the program. What I believe happens is that on playback, the program has maybe a 75% to play sound A and a 25% chance to play sound B. It improves realism by a bit, however, during the very end of the song Obsidian Heart, you can hear an issue with the snare. It's supposed to be striking on every beat but snare sound B is so soft it gets lost in the mix. It's actually an effect I don't want, but it serves its purpose and Guitar Pro is too useful for songwriting.
p6851
aVOh ok, I use tuxguitar which is similar but I think that one has the same hit sounds all the time. So I just accent the hits I want or lower the volume on surrounding hits. This is just so I get a better feel for how it will sound while the song is all in its midi format. When I go to record everything I will probably transfer the midi drum tracks to SD or something and get a lot more in-depth with the hits then.
p6852
aVFor drums you can get some drum samples [like this](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=metal+drum+samples) and then make a custom drumkit in Garageband [like this](http://youtu.be/S31a7dmu8hQ?t=1m32s)

asVGood Drum Machines for Metal Drumming (x-post from r/metaldrums)
p6873
(lp6874
VEzDrummer 2. Hands down the best for 'creating' custom drum tracks. The new features they added are pretty incredible really. Go to youtube or the toontrack website and watch demos on what it can do. The stock sounds are at least decent and you can upgrade them with better sound packs. (Metal!, Metal Machine, &amp; Metalheads all pretty awesome.) There is a free demo you can download from their website as well. i recommend watching those demo's first though so you have a better understanding of what it's capable of first.
p6875
aVAnd once you learn EzDrummer and get proficient at that, get Superior Drummer. It's EzDrummer on steroids. 
p6876
aVWith what ezdrummer 2 can do now, there's really no need for superior. In fact, superior, unless they release a new version soon, can't touch what ezdrummer now offers in the way of custom midi song creation. 
p6877
aVAre you or anyone else here able to do a tl;dr regarding ezdrummer 2 vs the drum programmer in logic?  
p6878
aVThe new drum thing they have in logic is a more simplified, less fluid, with less options variation of what is able to be done with EZD2. EZD2 sells itself with the tagline "talk to your drummer" and it's actually pretty true. It allows you to feed it a starting beat and it can very quickly and easily help you build an entire 'varied' song in a matter of minutes just off the simple 'kick &amp; snare' beat you fed into it. That's not possible in the same way in Logic Drummer. While the logic drummer is for sure a neat little addition to the DAW, it's no where near what EZD2 can do. 
p6879
aVI guess that's actually fairly long lol. So tl;dr: If you want to write quick, full custom drum tracks with lots of variation at lighting speed, buy EzDrummer 2. 
p6880
aVEZDrummer 2 definitely looks cooler than before, but to program drums in it, you still have to either do midi sequencing (which is really tedious), or have a midi controller (which I don't have). \u000a\u000aNormally, when I come up with a riff, I have a drum track going on in my head along with the riff, and what I want to do is bring that imaginary drum track to life by actually playing the drums, as opposed to programming them in EZDrummer, Cubase, Hydrogen, etc. Because that gives me more control over my rhythm and drums. So to that end, I wanted to know what are some good drum machines for laying down metal drum tracks.
p6881
aVFor someone that types up their own original MIDI for everything, is EZDrummer 2 worth it? I envisioned it to be better for people that liked pre-made beats or a way to build drum tracks out of existing MIDI. (I currently own both Superior and EZDrummer 1.)
p6882
aVIf you have the money get Superior Drummer. It's expensive but definitely worth every penny. Ion get a SHIT TON of AMAZING sounding samples and midi. \u000a\u000aI mean the time and effort these people put into making something this huge is insurmountable. \u000a\u000aEVERYTHING is customizable. And I mean EVERYTHING from the mic placement to the amount of bleed you want each mic to send to the main mix. \u000a\u000aIt's by far my favorite. 
p6883
aVWell considering I don't like paying hundreds of dollars for software, and I dunno how to torrent, Hydrogen works just fine if your randomize and use acoustic drum samples. You'll have to do the EQing in another software though, but I think it's better that way so that you can mix it with everything else better.
p6884
aVI tried Hydrogen, and honestly, I'm willing to pluck down at most $150 for a decent drum machine if it means I don't have to use Hydrogen. 
p6885
aVIt can be glitchy at times but.... Meh.
p6886
aVI don't mind the glitchyness, but I just don't wanna click on every 8th or 16th note for a drum beat. It's way too tedious. That's I wanna lay out my drum tracks by hand.
p6887
aVOhhh I see. I forgot some programs offer that.
p6888
asVHere's my newest song. Lots of atmosphere, riffs, and solos. Let me know what you think! Suntelia Aeon - The Mountain

(lp6890
VThis is awesome! Very atmospheric as you say but not cheesy or silly sounding. Song is structured very well to keep it interesting. Love when the tempo slows down around 2:30 and all the weird noises after. Possibly the lead guitar volume could be increased slightly so it stands out a bit more. Apart from that the production is outstanding, what did you use to record guitars and drums? I like the overall sound you're going for with this track, it's quite an original mix of different styles that works very well
p6891
aVThank you! I always appreciate this kind of helpful feedback. I do have that particular track at 2:30 turned down a little bit to make it less in-your-face and to help it blend more into the background, but I suppose turning it up might help guide the section a little better. \u000a\u000aI use a pretty low budget set up when I record. The guitars are done through POD Farm, and the drums are Drumkit From Hell loaded into Superior Drummer. You kinda have to do a bit of processing in both SD and your DAW to get DFH to sound any good, so I'm happy to hear it sounds alright!

asVQuestions about bass amp choices
p6926
(lp6927
VIn my experience(I play bass, used to tour off and on) it all comes down to personal preference. Some people are all about full amps while others prefer combos. I use a huge 8x10 cab and full rack. Most of the time when I get set up the sound guy just runs an XLR cable to my SansAmp or to my head, basically negating the entire need for a cabinet. There were shows I played where I didn't/couldn't load in my rig so everything was ran through my SansAmp. 
p6928
aVAh, fair enough. But then that would mean a combo amp should definitely have an XLR out, right?
p6929
aVYes. Depending on brand most I believe have an XLR out. A combo amp should do you fine. I mainly got a huge rig because the scene I came up in guitars and bass were never mic'ed(due to a small PA usually because the shows were held in VFW Halls or people's basements) so you had to have something loud enough to be heard. Some clubs when you show up with a huge rig the sound guy will tell you to not even bother loading it onto stage because he's going to run you direct. 
p6930
aVMy line of thinking is that you should pick up a combo first - this will mean you can play at any venue (bars and small places will not always have a backline, sometimes you'll just be playing in the corner). The next thing to buy will be a versatile head, which will mean venues that have a backline including a bass cab are now a breeze, you just need to bring your head and plug in. You can also arrange gear share with other bands sometimes, who may be willing to let you use their bass cab.\u000a\u000aNext step (I'm not there yet) is to get a cab to go with your head, or upgrade your combo. Now you've got all your bases covered!
p6931
aVGallien-Krueger has a series of combos (MBxxx-II Ultralight) that are super loud with awesome tone, plus XLR out and the option for an extension cab (either powered or not). The 1x15 is only two or three hundred watts and is really quiet, but I got the 210 version and I've been thrilled with it so far. It can hold its own against two Marshall half stacks with plenty of headroom left, AND it weighs less than my Marshall head!\u000a(I'm a long-time guitarist and drummer who recently started playing bass in a gigging thrash band.)
p6932
aVCheck out the Acoustic B200 and see if that will meet your needs. Economical and performs well. If they laugh and give you guff just pick up a 4X10 cab and connect it. But, you are right, overkill seems to be the rule of the day.
p6933
aVThis amp seems like a very very reasonable choice.
p6934
aVI've been playing bass in and out of  bands for 11 years now, and you really need to ask how powerful are your guitarist's amps? How far are you looking to go with this? Professional? Just for fun? To me personally the most important thing is can I hear myself? Then after that it's getting the right sound.

aVNo problem man. My suggestions are to look into Ibanez and ESP guitars. Those are my favorite 7 strings on a budget.
p6956
aVIf you wanna narrow it down even further, try /r/7string. Community is really friendly and pretty helpful. Questions like this come up a lot. Hope this helps!
p6957
aVCheck out Agile guitars. I have an [Interceptor Pro](http://www.rondomusic.com/custominterceptornov2014.html), it's got floyd rose(licensed i think), neck through, ebony neck, and stock EMG active pickups, so basically this should be right in your alley. I bought this guitar used on ebay for a little over $500, but that also included a coffin case in the purchase. Ebay would be your best bet if you can snipe a deal, however you can buy directly from their [store page](http://www.rondomusic.com/7string.html), as well as place a [custom order](http://www.rondomusic.com/customquote.html) if you have the money and time.
p6958
aVJust a heads up, there are several online shops (sweetwater, american musical, and zzounds) that offer a minimum of a 3 payment plan (sometimes as high as 12) without any financing or credit cards involved. This might allow you to bump up to a slightly better 'long term' guitar with the payments spread over 3+ months. I've used this process to buy my last several that I wouldn't have been able to afford 'upfront'. Good luck. 
p6959
aVI'll second agile. They're known for having good extended range guitars.
p6960
aV[deleted]
p6961
aVI'd do an Ibanez over an Agile. You can find either for about the same price and quality. But it's really based on your preference. Agile guitars have beefier necks compared to Ibanez and when it comes to a wider 7 string neck I like the slimmer profile a lot better. Also I really like Ibanez's floyd rose style bridges. They're a lot easier to re-string than your typical floyd. I think 7 string would be a good choice though, they're super versatile and you can find some really creative chord voicings.

asVJust had another quarter inch cable die on me... [xpost from /r/guitar]
p6965
(lp6966
VLearn to solder. The part that breaks most is the soldered connection of the wire to the plug. Resoldering the connection solves 95% of the issues I have with my cables. The rest of the time it's a bent plug or cut wire which need replacement.\u000a\u000aEdit: Forgot a cable recommendation. Cables similar to [these](http://www.amazon.com/Hosa-Cable-GTR205R-Guitar-Right/dp/B0018R6AGM/ref=sr_1_4?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407626683&amp;sr=1-4) will allow you to unscrew the plug connection cover so you can get in there and resolder it.
p6967
aVExcept they always fucking unscrew when you don't want them to &gt;:(
p6968
aVPlumber's tape on threads. Picked that one up from a pro roadie.
p6969
aVGaff tape will also work for this. Just don't use duct tape as it leaves a LOT of adhesive behind and rots faster than many other kinds of tape.
p6970
aVThis is my recommendation as well. The point just after the solder on the wire in any connector is the weakest part of any cable. Since you didn't mention a broken tip or anything like that my best guess is that the wire disconnected from the end. You can double check this by unscrewing the shell of the connector and looking at the solder points.
p6971
aV  Break down and throw a little more money at them.  Not only do cheap cables have shitty solder jobs with weak to no bracing to protect them if they get tugged or bent or something, but they also have shitty quality copper wires that degrade your signal.  On average you lose ~1dB of gain for every 10 feet of cable.  In other words, they eat your tone.  I solder my own cables out of high quality components, and they lose  ~1/4dB for every 25 feet or so, and I can beat the hell out of them to my heart's content and they will not fail.  Interested in some, you can PM me.\u000a  Otherwise look for something with a lifetime guarantee.  Monster cables are pretty good quality, and guaranteed for life.  I've had 2 of them go bad on me in the past, you just take them to Guitar Center and tell them it's broken and they'll just hand you a new one.  That's not a bad deal.  Just DO NOT get the ones with the gold jacks.  Its a marketing ploy.  The 1/4 inch jacks are capped with a little bit of gold, which makes them slightly bigger than 1/4 inch and will over time ruin the input jack of the things you're plugging them into.
p6972
aVJust for clarification for people, gold plated connectors(like you are talking about) are a ploy. True solid gold pins/connectors are certainly not a marketing ploy.

Technique wise it sounded pretty solid though. \u000a\u000a3. The tone was a bit weak overall. May I ask what your set up is? \u000a\u000a4. I think your tempo was a little slower than the original song, but I could understand that if you're a beginner. And in that regard you actually did pretty well. \u000a\u000aOther than these things, of course you just need vocals and drums and it'll be killer!

aVAwesome, thank you!\u000a\u000aI use Line 6 Spider 4 amp on the Slipknot setting and a Peavey Max 115 bass amp.  The bass is ibanez Gio and the guitar is Schekter Diamond series.  I turned the tone setting to 100%, but I agree, it's still lacking.  I don't know what more it needs/how to fix it though.  I don't have an interface between the amp and the software though.  I just have a 3.5 mm jack going from the headphone port on the amp to the computer and record silently.    \u000a\u000aI think to solve tempo I maybe just need a metronome.  Thanks for you help
p6985
aVMetronome will definitely help, I never record without one. DI'ing is definitely the reason for your tone. Maybe try blasting your amp a little more?\u000a\u000aI could tell that was a Line 6 Spider, I used to own one myself and I used it for my first album. To me it was really lacking as far as power output though. It's great to fuck around and practice on but recording is another story. I moved to a Fender Mustang and haven't looked back. I'm sure you can make it work. Especially with the Schecter Diamond Series. I actually just pawned mine off earlier last month (it had been through hell and back with the last owner, I only bought it for $40) so I know you can get a somewhat decent tone out of it.

aVSounds good.  I use Reaper, so I can just insert the metronome that I use myself.  Would that work?  I'm going to try and dial in the tone, see if Reaper has any mastering features(I just started using it), and hopefully get some better quality recordings within the next few days.  
p7000
aVCool. I use Reaper as well. Yea, you can just make an mp3 with the metronome enabled. If you want to make one with, and one without, the click, I can send back the drums with the clickless guitars. Or I can send just the drums and you can mix the guitars in. Whatever works for you.

aVI bought a Samson Go Mic for myself so I could record ideas at school. It's $40 new and it's a pretty good microphone for the price (and the size, it's quite tiny). It has the option to run as a cardioid mic, a cardioid with -10dB, and one that captures all sides (I forget what that's called). It's also a USB microphone so all you'll need is a laptop and something like Audacity and you'll be hooked up and rolling right away.\u000a\u000aEDIT: here's the link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001R76D42?pc_redir=1396773716&amp;robot_redir=1

p7053
aVSadly, no. I haven't been in a band in a couple of years so I couldn't tell you whether it picks up a whole band. However, it picks up my drums pretty well, and I pound my drums when I play them. I think if you positioned your equipment towards the mic and used the -10dB it could handle it (you could also further lower the sensitivity of the mic through your computer's sound settings). \u000a\u000aBut like I said though, I haven't been able to try it in a band setting, so that's all theoretical. I strongly recommend it though because you will get use out of it even if it doesn't hold up in a band setting. It comes in handy and it's so convenient to have a good mic that's able to connect via USB.

I made myself some sound absorbing panels that are hung on my walls, but I still really have to take my room into consideration when mixing.  I've also found that listening to your mix on as many different audio sources as possible helps provide a better idea or "sonic profile" of your mix.\u000a\u000aOh, and if you don't already know, double track guitars and hard pan them left and right.

asVTips on EQ/shaping settings for recording rhythm (metal) guitar?
p7075
(lp7076
VIt really depends on your tone and the style. I usually high pass everything below about 80hz (even for my 8 string which uses those frequencies) because it leaves space for the bass and kick drum to breathe and immediately clears up the mix. I boost a small amount around 250hz for some oomph, but not too much.  \u000a\u000aThe most important part for me is a large cut around 800 hz, which is a very boomy and resonating frequency and for me immediately makes my tone sound cleaner. Then I usually boost anywhere from 1.4k-2k (depending on my tuning) which helps with that percussive, well-defined sort of sound on the low strings.\u000a\u000aI usually roll off above 5-6k because none of those frequencies add anything to guitar and just take up the space of the drum overheads.\u000a\u000aUsually I put the high pass filter before my amp but the rest after the amp and let the amp primarily shape the tone. The EQ is just for chiseling the sound a little further. 
p7077
aVGreat tips man!  I'll implement these next time I'm in session.\u000a\u000aThanks for all of you guys' help.
p7078
aVI wouldn't EQ at all during tracking. After tracking, I'll high and low pass to ensure there's nothing unnecessary at the extremes, but anything else is just done to either tame excessive frequencies or make space for other instruments. A good spectrum analyser will show what needs to be done there.
p7079
aVIn my experience, I find that I like a lot less midrange in my guitars when recording compared to when I'm jamming with a full band. Depending on what you are playing through, you can usually get away with a fairly healthy scoop and still have enough mids to cut through the mix properly. Before you go messing around with your amp settings though, try fooling around with mic placement. Different positions can produce radically different tones. Try getting as close to your ideal sound with just the mic alone and then you can mess with EQ on the amp and in your DAW.
p7080
aVHow are you going to mix your tracks? Will you double track the guitars and hard pan the "typical" way? Then make sure you offset their EQ by just a bit so both guitars aren't 100% bleeding into each other.\u000a\u000aNow for guitar tone, you can choose to scoop your mids in typical fashion. However, what this will inevitably do is boost your bass and treble (it's equivalent since you basically have to raise the volume after scooping), which means your guitar will bleed into the bass region. Which means your track will have minimal bass since you'll have to kick the bass drum up to compensate as well.\u000a\u000aMy personal approach uses my own style. I like mids in my guitar and I like having bass which I use it to create harmonies. What I do is mid boost my guitar, single track, and soft pan my guitar and bass to opposite sides (Guitar R, Bass L, 20%). \u000a\u000aEDIT: For actual frequencies, I'll have my main guitar boosted around 1500 Hz. If I add a second guitar, I'll boost around 1000 Hz, since my vocals are higher frequency and I don't want to bleed into that. Bass track I boost around 500, bass drum around 300 to give everything enough space

aVHopefully after my next paycheck, I'll be ordering one of the higher-end Agile 7's. I've heard they are good bang for your buck and the high end ones come with name brand Grover, Hipshot, Seymour Duncan, EMG, etc. And the neck thru is a bonus. I know this is a little under your budget, but it's something to consider! 
p7085
aVI'm doing a custom order through them, in a week or two.  If you're looking at their higher end models, you might want to consider doing a custom one, due to the price range.  I spec'd out my order (les paul goldtop 7 string) and it came out to around $600 or so.
p7086
aV[This is the one I was looking at.](http://www.rondomusic.com/setorelt727ebcpwhite1.html) It pretty much has the specs I want. I already have Pegasus/Sentient combo to throw in it so the stock pickups dont bug me.
p7087
aVIf you like a fast neck you can always spend a little less on the guitar, get an Ibanez RG7, and then replace the pickups with EMG's or Seymour Duncan's. If you don't want to do that then maybe the Schecter Blackjack ATX or the new KM7(maybe a little expensive). Both come with high end pick ups. The KM7 comes with the passive nazgul/sentient pickups and sounds badass. The Blackjack comes with active Blackouts and also sounds badass. As mentioned in another post, there are some good Agile 7 string models at their higher price ranges as well.

aVIbanez also has the Promethean line of bass amps, which are small but powerful. Great for practicing and recording.
p7106
aVMetal basses are a less specific and necessary category of instrument than metal guitars, and by that I mean that most decent quality basses will work for Metal, as they will for almost all genres. \u000a\u000aThat said, one thing you may want to consider is that you're probably going to like basses with a more aggressive, brighter, and more articulate tone more for Metal. I'd personally avoid basses made by or like those made by Gibson or Epiphone, which tend to have a mushy, bass-heavy tone without much attack (and horrible balance to boot!) \u000a\u000aThe Ibanez basses already suggested are great, I play one myself. The Sterling by Music Man S.U.B. basses are also really great playing and sounding for the money in my opinion. The Squier Affinity Series Precision Bass PJ and Vintage Modified Precision Bass PJ are also quite affordable, versatile, and even simpler than anything else that's been suggested (they lack active electronics.)
p7107
aV Thanks! This is really helpful. 
p7108
aVIf you go for one of the squires, pay a bit more for the vintage modified. The affinity series has a bad reputation of quality control, and /r/bass sings plenty of praise for the vm as one of the best bang for your buck basses you can get.\u000a\u000aEdit: I also second all the ibanez recommendations. I love my sr505 and it works great for metal (and jazz and funk and whatever else I want to play).

VCouple of things divided into fun and less fun categories.\u000a\u000aFun:\u000a\u000aLearn a difficult song. This will usually force you to practice tremelo, galloping, down and alternate picking. With the more technical music, your left hand will get a good work out as well. I like Opeth for this. Very confusing for my left hand.\u000a\u000aJust learn a solo and go over it with a Metronome until every note is clean. You may not be skilled enough to learn that solo, but you'll be amazed at how the practice translates into other facets of your playing.\u000a\u000aLearn a relatively long but easy solo. This is more for getting used to doing long runs instead of a quick 2 second lick. I remember the solo from Iron Man being really good for that.\u000a\u000aRecord or find a backing track on YouTube and just solo over it. Make it a goal to do one new thing a day. It probably won't be a good new thing most of the time, but every now and then you will accidentally stumble on something fantastic. (This also helps with rhythm and quick thinking)\u000a\u000a\u000aNot as Fun: \u000a\u000aFind scales/arpeggios  and run through them with a metronome until every note is clean. When it's clean, bump up the BPM.\u000a\u000aGoogle guitar warm ups and find the warm ups that confuse your fingers. It doesn't have to sound melodic. This is all about wiring your brain to get used to atypical patterns.\u000a\u000aFind a repeating pattern or riff and play it over and over with a metronome. Something with alternate picking is preferred. \u000a\u000aEdit* as a rule of thumb, if I can do something three times in a row, that's when I'm ready to move on. Also this is just stuff that I did that helped me out. Didn't mean to sound preachy or anything\u000a
p7129
aVPractice, practice, practice!\u000a\u000aPractice with a metronome; start the pieces you are practicing on a low speed and *don't* increase the speed until you can do it dead on.\u000a\u000aPractice scales--start with major and minor scales and modes of the major scale. If you get those down, you can work on harmonic and melodic minor scales, and their associated modes. You can also find different dexterity drills that just work out your fingers but can't really translate to actual songs. Again, practice with a metronome, and don't increase the speed of a scale or drill until you have it down at the speed you're currently working on.\u000a\u000aBe a stickler for the basics. Use alternate picking, and *be strict about it*. There are other picking styles, but learn the basics first. Trust me, it's hard to go back and learn alternate picking once you have some chops under your belt. Make sure you position your hands properly (thumb should be on the back of the neck--many guitarists [myself included] don't use this technique all the time, but it really helps to have it as your foundation) and **use your pinky!**\u000a\u000aIt cannot be overstated how helpful it is to have a qualified instructor to give you lessons, as well. Above all, what I guess I'm saying is don't skimp on the fundamentals and take it slow. Don't take the quick and easy path; learn to break out of your comfort zone--that's the only way to learn.
p7130
aVYeah, I have began to learn a few of the scales like the E Minor pentatonic scale for example. I find them very fun to play. Especially when I switch between scales half way just to like mess around.

p7155
(lp7156
VFirst is getting some sort of drum sampler. Ezdrummer, Superior drummer, or some free alternative. Google for something that suits your needs. \u000a\u000aWhen you have something and you've installed it, etc., insert it as a midi instrument on a new track in reaper. Then, highlight the length of the track you need for your drum part. \u000a\u000aGo to insert in the menu bar and then insert new midi item. When it appears, double click on it and it should open the midi editor. Keys on the piano scroll will correspond with certain drums/cymbals. \u000a\u000aThat's a rough run through of what to do. There's a lot of guides online on how to program drums well, how to make everything sounds real, and then how to mix them. But this should hopefully get you started. 
p7157
aVUnfortunately I don't use Reaper but I thought I'd point you to some great free samples (http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/backline/529782-sharing-my-collection-drum-samples-here.html). Maybe they can be of use to you.

aVI just use ezdrummer in reaper and it works great
p7159
aVI've used all the different drum plugins that I could torrent, and I ended up buying jamstix.  There's a learning curve, and you have to read the manual, maybe 2 times, but once you get it, it kills the rest.  It's like a real live drummer as a Kemper is a real tube amp.\u000a\u000aNo matter what you chose to use, you'll have to learn it.\u000a\u000aIf you have a drummer person, why not record him and just use samples?

Oh, it's a book, btw.\u000a\u000aApparently it's gone into it's 2nd edition, so things might have changed (most likely improved) since 1st ed.. \u000a\u000aHighly recommended.

He's not a professional, and I haven't watched all the episodes, but it looks like he gets the basics covered pretty well. \u000a\u000aHe uses Cubase, and the plugins that comes with that, but the basics are the same. He also uses EZDrummer, though, so it should be somewhat familiar to you. \u000a\u000aPoke around on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Jamesmsv) for mini tutorials on other plugins as well.

VFor a first demo quite nice. The composition fits the genre, in my oppinion i would focus on the sounds in the next step. The tom and crash in the intro are too high and a bit flat and you should really change to another, more dynamic beat after the intro, with this drumsound the dum-dum-tschak doesn't have that mesmerizing, organic feeling Black Metal needs. \u000aOne thing that bugs me with the guitars is the sound of the bridge at around 1:30.

asVBass vs. Guitar
p7204
(lp7205
VMy only comment is to not do what is easier. Do what you would like. I played acoustic guitar in the beginning, then switched to bass. I wanted to try something different. I still play guitar, and generally write everything on guitar for my band. It also depends on what you are playing, if you want to play bass in a tech death band, it's going to be difficult. I would go with what you are maybe more comfortable with now, then after you have become more fluent in your abilities, try playing bass. 
p7206
aVIf you like both the same, I'd recommend bass, because there's lots of guitar players out there and not many bass players (at least where I live).\u000a\u000aLook into Squier guitars/basses. They're cheap, have good build quality (for the price) and are good for pretty much every music genre. If you only plan on playing metal, maybe look at the lower end of LTD and Schecter.
p7207
aVBass is fun, and bass players are always able to find gigs. As much as I love playing mine, I'm still a guitarist at heart. Gotta have that power chord crunch.\u000a\u000aFender (Squire) makes some good low-end instruments. For metal, make sure any guitar you buy has a humbucker pickup in the bridge position.
p7208
aVPlay whichever you want... I'm sure you'll end up owning and playing both anyway so you may as well start with guitar because as you said it's more difficult to learn. Plus anybody who can play guitar can pick up a bass and do a decent job of playing it but the reverse is not true. I'd recommend something from the LTD 50 series to get started on.\u000a\u000aedit - [this](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/esp-ec-50-electric-guitar) is a good deal on a really nice starter guitar (I still play my f-50 and it's hella decent), [here's](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/bass/esp-ltd-b-50-bass-guitar) a similar quality choice for bass
p7209
aVIf you play bass, you'll never lack for a band to play in. If you take the time to actually learn how to really play the bass, you can move up the ladder faster and further than guitarists. 
p7210
aVPlay both.  One will probably edge out over the other.  They are both very fun in their own distinctive ways.\u000a\u000aIt is easier to find groups to play in with bass.\u000a\u000aDon't worry about difficulty.  You can make either instrument as hard or easy as you like.  It's all about how you challenge yourself.

p7240
(lp7241
VComposition is just like being a visual artist. You must study the techniques of other artists such as Michelangelo, Dali, and Rembrandt in order to build a solid foundation, and then evolve to create your own styles and techniques which will be used to build the foundation for the next artist. If you want to be a great death metal composer, then learn the composition techniques of masters like Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Nile, or Death and evolve from there. 
p7242
aVThank you for your advice, much appreciated!
p7243
aVMinor scales, for the most part, are pretty much the tools of the trade for metal so that's a start.  Basic knowledge of theory helps, but don't be afraid to learn more and add to an ever increasing understanding.  Lessons always help.  Kirk Hammett got lessons from Joe Satriani, and Kerry King was getting lessons from a bloke by the name of Bob Jeffers.\u000a\u000a  Listen to bands, metal or not, where their songs get you off musically.  Listen to how they progress from one part to another, their use of time signature and tempo.  Some of my favourite changes in tempo don't really progress smoothly, they switch violently from one to another and back again with very little warning.  Think "A world full of shit coming down" part *Dead Embryonic Cells* by Sepultura where it goes from a medium pace, to flat out, and then back again for the next part.
p7244
aVThanks for your help, I appreciate it. I'm familiar with that Sepultura tune alright, so your example certainly resonated with me.
p7245
aVProcess is a fairly personal thing that everyone needs to figure out for themselves, because only you are going to know what works best for you. Experiment with different approaches and see which ones yield results. The one I run across the most is recording an improvisation, going back through the recording and picking out the good parts, and then putting those parts in a sequence.\u000a\u000aCohesion is often something that comes together in a full band environment. A transition that sounds jarring on just guitar can sometimes sound perfect when it's accompanied by bass and drums. Something I like to keep in mind is that you only ever have three options for "what to do next" when songwriting: something you've already done, something you've already done but different, or something new. \u000a\u000aThe theoretical structures that will work for what you're writing depend on what kind of metal you're making. It's hard to go wrong with the half-whole diminished scale, which shows up frequently in thrash and death metal, but death and black metal are often completely chromatic. The harmonic minor scale is also a useful one, and in contrast to its use in classical music, it's often used melodically, even keeping the augmented second leap between the sixth and seventh degrees. Pentatonic and blues scales show up a great deal in heavy metal and all the doom/sludge/stoner metal heavily influenced by Sabbath. Phrygian shows up pretty regularly, and even Locrian here and there. Plain ol' major certainly isn't a go-to choice, but it actually shows up more often than you might think, especially in progressive and power metal.\u000a\u000aThe one thing that's pretty much universal in metal (except for power metal) is free use of tritones (especially as points of arrival), and to a lesser degree, minor seconds. No matter what else is going on melodically or harmonically, you can always throw a tritone in there.

aVThank you for all that, I am very grateful. Hopefully I will start applying what you and the other commenters have said and start making some progress.

p7252
(lp7253
VIf you're planning on recording this, and you actually have a 20hz fundamental, you'll run into serious problems with mics and recording that way.\u000a\u000aThe way I track bass is to run it DI, and do it digitally. I usually split it into 2/3 channels and process each separately. \u000a\u000a1 track of highly compressed sub bass, with the mids/highs cut out\u000a\u000a1 track running through any good distortion you like (TSE x30, etc), and the low end cut out. This will be the dirt, and some mids\u000a\u000aOptional third track is just a normal DI full tone, blended in quiet to taste. Use this for more mids\u000a\u000aYou're going to have a lot of issues with the bass/drums/ other bass muddying up the low end, you you'll need to be very selective with how you eq them. Pick a frequency range that works for each part and then reduce the others in that area so it pops through.\u000a\u000aAlso keep in mind when you're tuned that low you're not going to get a very good attack unless you have very good pickups and pick really hard, but that's probably not what you're after for drone.\u000a
p7254
aVThe sub-bass isn't the problem, but thank you for your input. I actually wound up doing most of what you just described, since I'm well aware that my mics have a significant falloff around the 40Hz range. I only left out the distortion channel because I just didn't like what it was doing to my sound.\u000a\u000aUnplugged, my guitar sounds like it has a decent attack. My strings are still tight and bright. I'm mostly worried about my amplifier, say if such a relatively large speaker would be less responsive to my picking.
p7255
aVTurn knob named LOW on amp up. Turn knob named MID up. Loose the Reverb. 
p7256
aVAlright, I'll let loose with those two. Why do you suggest dropping the Reverb, though?
p7257
aVReverb is the buildup of sound as a result of reflections from the initial source in a room (or simulated room). Since lower frequencies are harder to absorb, low frequency energy builds up more than high frequency energy, which is easily absorbed by the rooms contents. Even if you are using a digital reverb, I would assume that it would try to simulate the very same effect.\u000a\u000aTherefore pulling back on the reverb on such a high LOW setting will ensure that the low end of your guitar mix doesn't unnecessarily build up and muddy up your mix. Having a low end heavy setup with reverb results in greater low frequency reflections and buildup. 
p7258
aVAlright, thanks for the explanation. Truth be told, I would like that extra muddiness for some atmospheric sections of a given piece. Otherwise, I'd likely have the unit bypassed or set on a *very* subtle low setting.
p7259
aVYou might be better off mixing in the reverb later, then, instead of tracking it.
p7260
aVBeing muddy and being thick sounding are two different things XD If your mix becomes muddy, your bass frequency buildup will reduce the amount of space and headroom given to your other frequencies, which isn't pleasant on the ears :( \u000a\u000aPerhaps if you want a thicker sound, try giving your guitars a gentle but wide boost at around 200-400Hz so that they thicken up nicely without having to add unwanted lows!   \u000a\u000aAlso what dhporter said works as well! Just still be very conservative with your reverb during your final edits. Bouncing our your file first then adding a slight amount of reverb to the master file is something some people like to do :D

p7264

aVI'm going to go over this sort of thing later. I didn't mean to disparage doubling entirely, but relying entirely on it is more dangerous than relying entirely on pedaling, in my opinion. But of course, it is better to mix and match different styles. I'm going to get into that later when I discuss counterpoint and what I call "mix-point".

aVBased (ha!) on what I've learned from my own recording: use a pick, your attack and therefore sound will be more consistent; use way more gain than you think you need; turn it up louder in the mix; and start weaving guitar lines around the bass. Instead of both guitar and bass playing the riff all the way through all the time, leave holes for the bass to be heard on its own, alternate riffs between left and right guitar tracks, etc. Makes for more varied dynamics, and for my ears, a more interesting song to listen to.\u000a\u000aSit down with In Flames' *Come Clarity* for the best metal bass guitar sound ever recorded and mixed.

aVThanks for the post! I've been playing bass for a little over a year now (and never have played anything before then) and needless to say, I'm still deep in noob country both with the bass and making music in general. The post was a great primer to give me more to think about and look into and I look forward to seeing more like it in the future.\u000a\u000aThanks again!

aVPeople unfamiliar with metal don't realize just how hard it grooves. Make no mistake, it does groove, and the groove is HEAVY!
