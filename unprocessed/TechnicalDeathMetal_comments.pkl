aVI actually ran into [Nate](http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Nate_Vennarucci/24997) at a show in SF a few months after this album came out. I asked, "Where's [Max](http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Max_Seeman/53876)?" to which he responded, "That's a good question.  No one really knows."  The resulting conversation led me to believe that Anomalous was Max's studio only hobby band, and that they would likely never play shows.  Nate has since left, [Marco](http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Marco_Pitruzzella/38512) left the bay area IIRC, and they haven't released anything since.  At best, we can hope for another album, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a tour.

Vwelp. I'll always have Planetary Duality.

p37
aVThe buhltrain has spoken
p38
aVlul
p39
aVI mean, that really really sucks because I love the Faceless, but seriously, Evan Brewer and Alex Rudinger are WAAYYYY too talented to just take directions from Keene all the time.
p40
aVDon't underestimate Wes Hauch either... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_vI5jmB3c8\u000a\u000aBut with that said - Alex Rudinger is actually from another planet
p41
aVwell this certainly supports your theory...\u000a\u000ahttp://www.metalsucks.net/2013/09/20/evan-brewer-out-of-the-faceless/
p42
aVIf this is true, I'll look for a true Planetary Duality follow-up with someone else. The torch must be passed.
p43
aVI fully expect The Zenith Passage to take the torch when their new album comes out. Their EP is so promising. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhAyzB5nTYM
p44
aVYes! Exactly who I had in mind!
p45
aVHell ya.
p46
aVThe Zenith Passage is just ok. Sounds waaaay too much like their influences. As does most of the Faceless stuff (Even though I enjoy them, they rip off all of my favorite bands). Guitar solos are really cool though (Zenith). Loads of better bands out there in this sub genre. 
p47
aVFunny thing is their influences are not really from the Faceless. They get influence directly from Deeds of Flesh, Soreption, Aeon. 
p48
aVYeah , there's a section in one of the zenith passage songs where they straight up use a deeds riff / drum Part. It just sounds unoriginal to me. Not trying to hate but fallujah is on the same label and way better , as are gorod and arkaik. 
p49
aVCool story bro
p50
aVI lolled, OUT OF THE FOWKIN BOWWDEHHH.
p51
aVMan that is one of my favorite albums.  I didn't mind their newest album but it went in a direction I personally did not enjoy.  What did u guys think of the newest album?
p52
aVCompletely different in musical approach and a failure to deliver in my opinion. 
p53
aVHave you heard Veil of Maya - ID? I'm not a VOM fan, but that album is top notch. I put it close to on par with Planetary Duality, and coincidentally it was produced by Keene.
p54
aVI have heard it- own it too, I think. They never really cut it for me. The scales they us and whatnot don't really do much for me.
p55
aVWeak. Happy ill be seeing them again with btbam just in case. BUT- the faceless is just another name for what the real band's name is: the michael keene show. He'll find new people to further his own ego im sure.\u000a\u000aI really hope he does, because I &lt;3 the faceless
p56
aVDo people have proof of Keene being an egotistical control freak besides somebody having a bad experience with him here and there? I talked with him for about 20 minutes and he seemed really down to earth, humorous and easy going.\u000a\u000aI know if I were on tour all the time, I might be a tad moody at times but that never showed when I talked to him.\u000a\u000aI loved Autotheism. Fuck the haters. So some metal sounds like other metal? Go figure.

aVI hope I can achieve Yngwie level in life.
p59
aVEvan Brewer being MIA from the BTBAM tour certainly doesn't help
p60
aVOh noooes! They are so incredibly talented.  
p61
aVNo!! No! Noooooooo!!
p62
aVI'm really glad I got to see them, what a bummer.
p63
aVThat would be a shame. But AFAIK Keene is the mastermind  behind the band anyway, so I guess he'll find other talented guys.
p64
aV[deleted]
p65
aVSeen 'em twice.\u000a\u000abummer man
p66
aVNooooo :-(.
p67
aVThis is definitely not true
p68
aVglad they arent breaking up. love the faceless. maybe next album they will get rid of the singing and get back to the brutality
p69
aVHonestly I could care less after their last album. Also, I saw them back in the day and was very underwhelmed by their live performance. The musicianship was technically brilliant, but they had zero stage presence or energy, just stood there playing and looking bored. It was a packed house too, I was pretty dissapointed. Born of Osiris and Arsis were much better. 
p70
aVI think it's for the best if it happens. It'd be cool to see Keene go solo imo.
p71
aVLast album sucked so....don't really care. \u000a\u000aThanks. 
p72
aVAgreed. The singing shit made my dick invert itself.
p73
aV[deleted]
p74
aV[deleted]
p75
aVI should think it is pretty obvious, really.\u000a\u000a"do you like this band? would you like to see them live? Well, they are potentially breaking up soon, after which *you will not be able to see them live*, so if you want to go, dont wait."
p76
aVI think the point that xmaspackage is making is that, if a band is about to break up, especially due to tension within the band (as has been suggested in this thread due to Keene apparently being something of a control freak), the live show has a reasonable chance of not being very good because being annoyed with band mates tends to hinder live performances, in my experience.\u000a\u000aI still see your point, but I think that xmaspackage's point (as interpreted by me, at least) is valid as well, albeit not spelled out fully.
p77
aVI saw them a few months ago on the Dillinger tour and they sucked. It looked like nobody wanted to be on stage. It was so depressing.
p78
aVI came here to say this, i had the exact same experience. Ive seen the faceless a bunch of times and am obsessed with most if their music, but seeing them recently with within the ruins and rings of saturn was a bust. The only one that looked like he was remotely into it was Alex.
p79
aVI'm sorry to hear that; I hope you at least got to see some other bands put on a great show!

aVlol shit I knew I'd get that wrong but you lucky bastard I'd love to see them live.

VA not-as-quick-as-I-had-hoped list.\u000a\u000aFor pure techdeath; [Necrophagist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfxLLWX8TM8) every day.\u000a\u000aFor some groovy techdeath; [Psycroptic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaUiuhI_OpE), [Nihility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyS8xCgIVg&amp;feature=kp) and [Negation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz8Km-1DIgA) era Decapitated, [Soreption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laYCbcR9EeI), etc.\u000a\u000aFor "what could have been the flagship sound of techdeath": [Planetary Duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spsOC5aN5FU)...\u000a\u000aFor "fucking hell, this is some refreshing-ass, original shit": [Artificial Brain](http://youtu.be/dCHTe-J9h20).\u000a\u000aFor some atmospheric shit; [Fallujah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewm2ZnRq-9A).\u000a\u000aFor unique, funky, jazz, bluesy shred techdeath; [Sleep Terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2jSyBE9670).\u000a\u000aFor utterly unique and sadly missed techdeath; [Anata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6Dm42zSec)\u000a\u000aFor mathy, interesting shit; [The Crinn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_PDow7KCoA), [Orgone](http://orgoneus.bandcamp.com/album/the-goliath).\u000a
p104
aVWhy do you say it could have been the "flagship sound"?\u000a\u000a+1 for Anata. I wish they would release another album.
p105
aVPlanetary Duality is an album that meets the demands of being considered techdeath, and is also extremely unique, yet modern, at the same time. It bridges the gap between the younger 'core' crowd and the traditional techdeath crowd. It's an album I think everyone can agree on. But The Faceless took a turn away from the unique sound of Planetary Duality and I suspect they won't visit it again. That's just how I feel about it. But thankfully [The Zenith Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHRLGWIRhfA) is doing good work!\u000a\u000aI've gotten word that Anata is over. :(
p106
aVAlso, Artificial Brain really reminds me of "Lykathea Aflame". Anyone else get that vibe?
p107
aVI was actually considering putting them up with Artificial Brain! I hear they're back together or something?
p108
aVUpvotes like hell for mentioning Anata. The Conductors Departure was probably one of my all-time favorite albums. 
p109
aVI'm in the minority here, I am not a fan of atonal or overly "mathy" Tech Death. I prefer stuff that leans melodic but is still very difficult to play, I listen to tech death to be impressed by skill and to enjoy the tune. My favorite group right now is [Ade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGO1chg-mg8)
p110
aV*Spartacus* is a great album. Kollias is a fucking beast! 
p111
aVI'll have to check them out. I like how you stated that you're a minority, that in the metal scene is too common. Like what you will like and I'll consider you a tech fan all the same brother.
p112
aVI like wormed, decapitated, and hour of penance type of stuff.
p113
aVDecapitated is some absolutely wonderful shit. All day. Everyday.
p114
aVGorguts? Can I include Psycroptic too?
p115
aVInclude who ever you want mang 
p116
aVI wouldn't include Psycroptic's latest, but certainly Symbols of Failure.
p117
aVIt was a groovy album but I felt it was definitely missing something.
p118
aVI'm a big fan of really thick and juicy sounding bands like Rivers of Nihil, Deeds of Flesh, Ulcerate, and Artificial Brain.
p119
aVI absolutely love Rivers of Nihil 
p120
aVFucking Artificial Brain! I'm so happy that band exists!
p121
aVI like to listen to Decrepit Birth when I'm smoking weed.
p122
aVI don't listen to a TON of tech death, but when I'm lifting I love to listen to Beneath the Massacre. Beyond Creation is probably my favorite tech death to listen to when I'm just hanging out. I also really like Allegaeon and they're local for me 
p123
aVBeyond creation is great. Just started getting into them
p124
aVBeyond Creation are pretty sweet i listen to them to kill my depression from time to time
p125
aVHave you heard Inferi? Not the same as Beyond Creation but also awesome
p126
aVI'll have to give them a listen
p127
aVAbsolutely hear you on beneath the massacre when im doing any kind of work whether it's cleaning my place,office work,or working out.
p128
aVCheck out my post titled "Beyond Creation". They play a quite aggressive style of technical death metal, but not nearly as aggressive as bands such as Beneath the Massacre or Origin. Bands like Beyond are most acts that their bassist is associated with, due to his fret less being the major turn on in Beyond. Other than that, I'm loving Separatist, Origin, Hour of Penance, Fleshgod Apocalypse, and many more. 
p129
aV"Bands like Beyond are most acts that their bassist is associated with" what are you trying to say there
p130
aVWords, man. I have no clue what happened with my brain there. I was saying that if you want to hear something like Beyond Creation, listen to other bands that Forest plays for. 
p131
aVRight on i love teramobil. Kinda hectic
p132
aVI'm still hanging on to Necrophagist, Muhammed's solos are just incredible.\u000aAlso, I can't stop listening to Alterbeast. 
p133
aVAs am I...as am I.
p134
aVWhat I feel like listening to is generally on a whim, i.e. I might remember a band/song and want to hear it. Not really "I'm in the mood for X right now".\u000a\u000a* [A Loathing Requiem - False Gods Render Death](http://youtu.be/94vLxK_uRxM): don't know much by them, but this song is good\u000a\u000a* [Inferi - The Path to Apotheosis (full album)](http://youtu.be/ShiEuQk5agg): very fast, very good solos (without sounding too much like wankery). called "technical melodic death metal" on metal-archives\u000a\u000a* [Ouroboros - Glorification of a Myth (full album)](http://youtu.be/3ynO1sGBCQs): not as good or as tech, but still worth a listen\u000a\u000a* Anything by Obscura\u000a\u000a* [Son of Aurelius - The First, The Serpent](http://youtu.be/gfS4I2-Srok): I love this song, and love the solo. The rest of the album is pretty good, but this one sticks out to me\u000a\u000a* The final album by !T.O.O.H.! Close to grind in some ways, but it's pretty amazing. Especially when you get to the end of the final track. Quite the finale for that band.\u000a\u000a* Anata. Not quite tech death, but I especially like their final album, The Conductor's Departure.\u000a\u000a* Ekser: they only have one album but it's pretty good.\u000a\u000a* Gorod: all of it. In my opinion, they have gotten better with each release. Probably my second favorite band overall.\u000a\u000a* Neuraxis: I prefer their earlier stuff\u000a\u000a* Pavor: only 2 releases as far as I know. Really dirty-sounding stuff. I like this song and solo: [A Schizoid Uglifier](http://youtu.be/aypCsEpgnqY). If you like bass, you might like this band. This is insane stuff.\u000a\u000a* [Spawn of Possession - The Apparition](http://youtu.be/7oT9_1zEDEA): nothing to be said about it. Fantastic song. If Gorod hadn't had a release that year, this would have been the best song of 2012.\u000a\u000a* I like Capharnaum's only 2 albums. But they're too short, and the vocals on the second one aren't that good (the guy from Trivium, I think)
p135
aV!T.O.O.H.!
p136
aV&gt; A Loathing Requiem - False Gods Render Death[1] : don't know much by them, but this song is good\u000a\u000aIt's the solo project of Inferi and Diskreet guitarist Malcolm Pugh! Insanely catchy stuff.
p137
aVI love Soreption. I love the crisp clean over produced drums and absolutely crushing guitar riffs. The bass is always audible but most of all I like the tight guitar playing. \u000a\u000aAs a guitarist I love listening to any kind of metal with tight fast widdly guitar line. Now I don't mean bands like Origin. To me they come off as a tad sloppy or rushed. But bands like The Faceless, Soreption, Gorod, Spawn of Possesion, Necrophagist, Obscura and many others similar where you KNOW it took them some time to master a few of those riffs, that brings me a lot of goosebumped listens.\u000a.
p138
aVHow on earth can 300 bpm not seem rushed. I agree on everything but the origin comment.
p139
aVAnother guitar player here. I appreciate Origin, but their guitars do certainly sound sloppy and rushed. I think it's due to their tone (mostly high frequencies) and amount of distortion mostly, but the riffs they write don't really help for sounding precise and tight. But you have a strong point about the bpm, tremolo picking 16th notes at 300 bpm is going to sound rushed and sloppy now matter how tight you are.\u000a\u000aEdit: wrong 'their'.
p140
aVI know, it was pretty poor wording but the other person who replied kind of nailed my point. 
p141
aVI love listening to incredibly wanky or compositionally challenging tech death when I'm doing research or writing grants/papers (I'm a grad student studying cancer pharmacology). Puts me in the zone to just think deeply. Band examples- Viraemia, Spawn of Possession, Fleshgod Apocalypse (first album and mafia), Archspire, Demilich, Beyond Creation, Nile etc.
p142
aVMindfuck solos -&gt; revocation.  \u000aMindfuck riffage and songwriting -&gt; spawn of possession.  \u000aBeautiful lyrics and mystically progressive Songs -&gt; rivers of nihil.  \u000aGodlike basslines -&gt; obscura, beyond creation, augury, depending on my need for progression, outer space weirdness and heaviness.  \u000aOver the Top precision and groove -&gt; soreption
p143
aVI personally prefer bands that don't sound too over produced. Gorguts, rivers of nihil, and necrophagist are some examples of what I like
p144
aVWhile i love rivers of Nihil the album sounded over produced.
p145
aVYeah I have to admit you're right there, however for some reason I don't notice/mind as much with that album
p146
aVIt's all about the riffs for me man
p147
aVMaybe it's because I'm a Canadian who came of metal age in the late 90's-2000's, but my favourite tech death will always be the original insane Canadian shit: Cryptopsy's [None so Vile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkNbTS7uhLE) is maybe the best death metal album ever, and Kataklym's [Temple of Knowledge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiim_SKNULM) has a similar sound. And of course, Gorgut's [Obscura](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1X0Bejwnko) which is not only technical in crazy time changes or fretboard gymnastics, but progressively pushes boundaries of tonality and harmony in ways no band has really done since. What I love about all this French Canadian shit is that sort of raw "mid-fi" production and crazy energy- that it's kind of sloppy and ahead of the beat (pre-protools) but also masterful. There's a tension and intensity that comes to the surface as a sort of emotional push.  \u000aAnother great Canadian tech record is The End's [Transfer Trachea Reverberations for Point: False Omniscient](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_-49_pxKdQ), which is a bit more of that Willowtip style of the mid-2000's, but a really stellar performance, especially in the vocals. Great dark, painful atmosphere.
p148
aVDon't hate I've been listening to Meshuggah lately.

aVDecrepit Birth. The guitar solos make me feel like I am being flown across the universe on an alien space ship. 
p151
aVi enjoy Inferi, Beyond Creation, Decrepit Birth, Cattle Decapitation, Enfold Darkness, Archspire, Soreption, Arkaik, Cognizance, Deeds of Flesh, Diskreet, Gorod, Hideous Divinity, Necrophagist, Obscura, Odious Mortem, Ovid's Withering, Rivers of Nihil, Severed Savior, Son of Aurelius, Sophicide, Smaragos, Spheron, Spawn of Possession, Suffocation, Unhuman, Upheaval, Vale of Pnath, Warforged, Wretched, The Zenith Passage. etc. etc. theres more i just quickly went though my windows media player library. 
p152
aVTop five for me, regardless of mood\u000a1. Nile\u000a2. Hour of Penance\u000a3. Decapitated\u000a4. Beyond Creation\u000a5. Spawn of Possession
p153
aV*[Thelema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqW2OITfcSI) - Jazzy, progressive, anthemic sounding tech death. Not a lot of people have heard Thelema, and thats a damn shame. \u000a\u000a*[Pavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSAMtGQwle8) - Their second album (Furioso) is a beast! The bass solos... my gawd the bass solos.\u000a\u000a*[Sophicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EooVEeBbbA) - Impressive new band in the genre. \u000a\u000a*[Canopy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93PEgRgRzxg) - I just love this intro...

p204
aVI liked Organic Hallucinosis. It was techy, modern (don't get me wrong, their earlier work is the best imo) and filled with interesting grooves. \u000a\u000aTo me they're almost taking out the death elements. Nothing dirty about it anymore. The riffs almost sound like they've been picked off the discount modern metal shelves.
p205
aVfor me, the problem with all the albums after The Negation are the vocals. way too metalcore for their riffs. 
p206
aVHonestly one of my favorite parts of Carnival is Forever were the vocals. Very clear and easy to understand, but still aggressive and unique among death metal 
p207
aVThe Negation is my favorite Decapitated album, Nihility is second and Winds of Creation 3rd. \u000a

aVDeath was the band that got me into more technical music - particularly the song Flattening of Emotions.  God that song was so much heavier than anything I had ever heard.  Give me goosebumps still.  Ironically was listening to stuff off of Spiritual Healing when I saw this pop up on my front page. Its amazing how many bands have been influenced by death.

p266
aVlol christ i hope not. thanks for the update dude. braindrill never tours..been waiting for then to come to montreal for years
p267
aVDidnt they announce shortly before that last update that they were retiring from touring? I might be wrong, but that's what I seem to remember.
p268
aVLast I remember was this:\u000a[http://www.metalsucks.net/2008/03/20/bye-bye-brain-drill-death-metallers-go-up-in-smoke/](http://www.metalsucks.net/2008/03/20/bye-bye-brain-drill-death-metallers-go-up-in-smoke/)\u000a\u000aThat was like six years ago. But, full cavity search.
p269
aVThat bass in the beginning blows my freakin mind man!!!
p270
asVThe Faceless or Beyond Creation?
p271
(lp272
VThe Aura by Beyond Creation is probably my favorite techdeath album out there. it's amazing.
p273
aVI love how it's so technically proficient, yet still has those slow-tempo, sometimes easy riffs that sound that like the earth is being torn in half. Beyond creation has mastered the techdeath breakdown too.
p274
aVYeah totally agree. That frettless bass though. So pretty sounding
p275
aVOh my god. It's so tasty. Also, everyone should check out [Son of Aurelius](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfS4I2-Srok)
p276
aVI think I'm gonna go with Aura first, I'll definitely check more of The Faceless though
p277
aVJust listen to Planetary Duality and Alkedeama. Autotheism is a bit...too different to listen to first. I prefer Beyond Creation more though. 
p278
aVAutoatheism was so bad.  I'm sorry but faceless was doing so well and suddenly it just went to shit 
p279
aVNOOOOOOOO. Autotheism was their best. 
p280
aVThe Faceless obviously have three times as many albums put out and the funny thing is, that each one has a completely different style. The first album is sci-fi deathcore and is actually one my favorite deathcore albums out there. their second album deserted all the -core and went straight up tech-death, which again got us one of the best albums of it's kind, also very sci-fi themed.  \u000athen they made their third album which turned a bit away from the tech and got way proggier and it's probably my favorite album of them. it isn't really that sci-fi anymore either, but actually very atheistic. I am no atheist anymore, but I still like the bashing of christianity in the lyrical sense.  \u000a\u000abeyond creation on the other hand have a tech/prog style with noodly fretless bass and some really amazing riffs. *the aura* and *the departure* are among my favorite songs of all time and the fact that I don't have never bought anything from the faceless, although listening them for years, but having bought *the aura* on cd after listening to the album about three times speaks for itself.  \u000a\u000a**the faceless** offer more albums and way more diversity across their discography, but beyond creation are(imo) better. also their bass player (dominic forest lapointe) is my favorite bass player in the whole wide world
p281
aVThey're both incredible. The Aura and Autotheism are both 10/10 albums IMO.
p282
aVListen to the first two albums by The Faceless. They are amazing. Beyond Creation is also amazing so give them a lot of time as well. \u000a\u000aAutotheism by The Faceless sort of loses me. His singing is painful. The heavy / shreddy parts are awesome, but there's just too much wrong with the album to like it as a whole. I like parts of it. \u000a\u000aJust my opinion on it. 
p283
aVI like Autotheism a lot, but I do prefer their older stuff. The first three tracks on Autotheism are really strong and the song Ten Billion Years is great too.
p284
aVMy favorite is Hymn of Sanity. The album isn't bad as a whole, I just don't like the singing parts much. I don't hate all singing, I'm just not a fan of his. I have plenty of music with singing I like. 
p285
aVOh definitely, I know they were trying to go out of their comfort zone with the clean vocals and various other things, which I appreciate but I agree his clean vocals aren't the best ever.
p286
aVThey're two unique styles, honestly. The Faceless has a bigger catalogue right now, so you could probably spend a good bit of time immersing yourself in them. Beyond Creation, though still very technical as well, sticks to traditional metal a little bit more just in the scales they use.
p287
aVWhy not both?
p288
aVIt depends. The faceless have changed their style on all three albums. I personally prefer the faceless, but you should listen to both in depth for sure. If you like your metal to be more progressive, listen to the autotheist movement. You should check out polarity and diminishing between worlds by decrepit birth as well.
p289
aVTHE FACELESS. Listen to Akeldama all the way through first.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KudwhIozknE
p290
aVDon't listen to Autotheism. Listen to Akeldama.
p291
aVI would say listen to Akeldama and Planetary Duality *first*, but I really like Autotheism and would suggest listening to it (with an open mind) as well. It doesn't sound like them, they changed up their sound and experimented a little, but it is still a good album.
p292
aVIf you want to listen to Autotheism I recommend reading the lyrics along with each song. The lyrics are quite good and definitely helped me appreciate the album a lot more than I originally had.
p293
aVHOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE AUTOTHEISM? Keene has amazing cleans. Autotheism was my favorite album from them. The Autotheist movements were just breath-taking. It was a masterpeice. \u000a\u000aBut I haven't listened to Beyond Creation, so at this point, The Faceless. I'll check them out though. 
p294
aVSeriously haha people that don't like autotheism just want the band to keep doing the same thing and never progress I guess. I got to see it live and from then on developed a huge appreciation for it, its progressive as fuck.
p295
aVI know the large majority of people who don't like it is their "core" fan base who don't listen to anything but core. 
p296
aVFor real dude. But Beyond Creation is also incredibly sick, definitely give them a listen.\u000a
p297
aVWill do. 
p298
aVI really like the clean vocals, but other than that I don't find the songs very captivating compared to their other albums
p299
aVI haven't listened to Autotheism a whole lot, but it just seemed less technical than the previous Faceless records. I dig Autotheism, but not as much as Akeldama or Planetary Duality.
p300
aVTo be honest, I was never a huge fan of Akeldama. I loved Planetary Duality, it's what got me into The Faceless. But Autotheism amazed me. Keene's vocals, his shreddage on the guitar, but it still had those ground-shaking vocals. And Lyle's Jazz-fusion style drumming. It was a great and solid album. I loved it. 
p301
aVI've listened to a lot more Faceless than Beyond Creation, but I think the Faceless has a much more unique sound to them.  Michael Keene has all those really cool dissonant sounds and extended chords that I really like.  Beyond Creation is solid though.  I'm probably one of the few people who actually like the clean singing on Autotheism. 
p302
aVI love the clean singing, as well as the entire theme of the album. Now I'm an autotheist.
p303
aVThere are some really cringey lyrics like entire Hail Science song, but I still really like the album.  I think that Planetary Duality is my favorite though.
p304
aVBetter than any Christian metalcore song.\u000a
p305
aVDAE LE SETAN LOL XDD
p306
aVI don't care what the religious orientation is.  If its good music its good music.  I am not a Christian, but I love Extol.  They have some absolutely amazing riffs.  Hail Science reminds me of something I'd see on /r/cringepics.
p307
aVYou aren't the only one who loves Michael Keene's beautiful vocals. 
p308
aVThe Faceless. Autotheism is great I don't know why everyone's being such a critic. \u000a\u000aPlanetary Duality is also really good... pretty much just the Faceless.
p309
aVI never get tired of listening to The Faceless' first two albums. There is so much to every song on every listen. I would highly recommend them. I have never listened to Beyond Creation, but I will be in a few seconds. 
p310
aVneither use metalcore type yelling, both bands are great. I think I prefer Beyond Creation but both bands are worth your time. In regards to the Faceless, start with Planetary Duality or Akeldeama. Their new album is more progressive. I saw Beyond Creation live in montreal a few years ago and they were phenomenal.
p311
aVI'd have to say The Faceless, only cause i haven't gotten into Beyond Creation yet. Can anyone recommend some songs i should check out?
p312
aVThey only have one album, so I'd say to just listen to the album. [Listen here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U16hXRMqJw)
p313
aV[deleted]
p314
aVIf you like The Faceless, check out Dysmorphic next. 
p315
aVPlanetary Duality is such higher quality than The Aura in my opinion. It's so highly detailed and deliberate, with a really solid atmosphere that I feel Beyond Creation just doesn't really acheive. Autotheism was pretty disappointing, being that it was just "the Michael Keene Show". The lineup during PD is what made it so strong. 
p316
aVI don't know if many other people do this but I give a band 30 seconds (60 if they do long intros)\u000a\u000a\u000aIf they don't hook me in 30 seconds I move on and never look back.\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: TIL; Knowing what you like is bad.
p317
aVI give a band 30 minutes.
p318
aVThere's been lots of times where I have to give the band a chance, I might not like it at first but I can recognize the talent and keep listening. Then you get hooked.\u000a\u000aThat seems like a great way to miss out on a lot of good stuff.
p319
aVI dig that but I really only care for a specific thing, when it doesn't get the hair on the back of my neck to stand up it isn't doing it for me.
p320
aVSometimes that can take a while to happen..
p321
aVI can appreciate that may be the case for some, that is not the case for me.\u000a\u000a\u000aI have tried, hundreds of times, to "get into" bands but I just can't. I get bored insanely fast, that is why I listen to tech-death and if there is a lul I'm just not interested.

VI never really got into this band, but these tracks from the new album are incredibly sick.
p334
aVEvery fucking album that has came out this year sounds better than the last, and I'm like, "album of the year":  Fallujah, Archspire, Inanimate Existence, Abysmal Dawn, Beyond Creation, but I think this is gonna be my actual favorite album of the year judging by the three songs they've released so far. FUCK. 2014 is the year of Tech Death.
p335
aVHaha that's exactly how I feel. This one came out of left field though. I've always liked JFAC but just as a by the books tech death band that I wouldn't skip if it came on. These three songs have totally changed that though.
p336
aVAbsolutely.  Their other stuff has always been a lot of hit-and-miss to me, but goddamn, these new songs are incredible.
p337
aVPsycroptic is supposed to be dropping a new song tonight as well lol. Here I thought the year was over and I could pick my top albums. Boy was I wrong.

aVIt's crazy, lots of amazing stuff has come out these last two years but nothing has topped cattle decapitation's monolith of inhumanity.
p340
aVYeah, it's definitely some next level shit.  Travis Ryan's vocals are incredible and my favorite part of the album.  I feel that way about Decrepit Birth - Diminishing Between Worlds.  It'll be 7 years old in January and it's still untouched by 95% of the stuff that is coming out now in my opinion, and there is some pretty great shit being pumped out lately.

aVI would be hesitant to say Neuraxis, but definitely Augury. I'd also add Anata. They are the kings are tech death harmony it seems. 
p362
aVNeuraxis alternates between the brutal sides and melodic sides of death metal, in my opinion. Most of their songs feature minor keys, as opposed to something more dissonant, such as phrygian, octatonic, or faux-atonality, which most death metal bands use.

p461
aVMindly Rotten is my favorite band out of the Colombian brutal death scene. I've seen them compared to other Colombian outfits like Internal Suffering and Carnal, as well as Desecravity (Japan), but they seem pretty unique to me.\u000a\u000aThe Most Exquisite Agonies was their debut and gained them some internet notoriety for being an example of the totally over-the-top brutal deathmetal coming out of Colombia. However, it's really chaotic and sloppy, to say the least. Moreover, the songs are less distinct than later releases and tend to run into each other. It took me a while to appreciate and I don't even try to justify my reasons for liking it to others, LOL. I recommend checking out their latest two albums.\u000a\u000aHere are some links to YouTube and Grooveshark for anyone interested:\u000a\u000aTheir debut album: [The Most Exiquisite Agonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwy-T14ygrc&amp;list=PLbvfJhfOuZc0KZ3ihcs-IB7vs5GJd-2Rh&amp;index=1) (2005)\u000a\u000a\u000aTheir second album [Proliferation of Disaster](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Proliferation+Of+Disaster/7758008) (2011) was my introduction to Mindly Rotten. I became an instant fan of theirs upon encountering the videos for [Outside Forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx_b1I8DgMk) and [Primordial Absence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt4y47KbWVY). Totally insane!\u000a\u000a\u000aThe new album [Effacing the Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWbcuU9ydt0) (2013) has the tightest playing, catchiest songwriting, and cleanest production of all three releases. It's catchy, but still really weird. Very different from their debut.

(lp572
VThere was an article on /r/metal a while back that was from Metal Injection or something similar interviewing the ex-drummer from Rings of Saturn. Basically he said that that Lucas recorded everything at half speed, for a fact, on the first album, then doubled the speed and protooled the living shit out of it. He talked about having a hell of a time trying to play it full speed live, while Lucas usually played the guitar track from an ipod and turned his live guitar way down and basically faked it most of the time. He also said that Lucas planned the second album at half speed, played by himself, even though they had brought on a new guitarist that could play all of it at full speed. So basically Lucas is a cheating asshole.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Here's the article.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/06/more-rings-of-saturn-drama-ex-drummer-brent-silletto-shares-his-side-of-the-story/
p573
aVOh yeah, I'm aware of the history behind this guy. I can't believe he still shows his face in public, let alone ask for 20k to record his shitty half-speed tracked music.
p574
aVI mean, the guy has talent, he's just lost all his credibility in anything by cheating to go farther than he really can. Which makes him an asshole. A talented asshole, but still.
p575
aVUnfortunately so. As a guitar player, I wouldn't mind if his hands were crushed in some horrible half-speed recording session accident.
p576
aV&gt;He also said that Lucas planned the second album at half speed, played by himself, even though they had brought on a new guitarist that could play all of it at full speed.\u000a\u000aWell the fact is that the second album, according to the producer Robert Velasquez Swanson, was not tracked in half-time even if the first was tracked at half-speed.\u000a\u000a[Here's](http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/05/the-drama-continues-rings-of-saturn-guitarist-refutes-accusation-that-band-recorded-album-at-half-speed-accuser-fires-back/) the following article with the culmination of this, including the producers' post. \u000a\u000aSo say what you will about his kickstarter campaign but I'm not sure it's fair to criticism him for unproven allegations of a former band member who had been out of the band for a couple of years.
p577
aVTrue. To the ex-drummer's credit, he did say that he couldn't be positive that the second was recorded half speed, because he wasn't there. He just said that he was pretty sure because that's what Lucas' intentions were, and what he'd done before. 
p578
aVActually I was mistaken - Swanson was the studio engineer for both albums (not producer only on Dingir). Also the other side of this, Mann's perspective is:\u000a\u000a&gt;[He couldn\u2019t play our material at all in the studio, and by the time we toured, he could barely get through the songs live. It\u2019s amazing how he is trying to flip this story back on us when it is really about him.](http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/08/even-more-rings-of-saturn-drama-band-responds-to-ex-drummers-accusations/)\u000a\u000aI've also read, I think, a facebook post detailing this a bit more with Lucas stating that the recording budget for the first album was almost completely drained by the drumming sessions since the drummer couldn't play. Can't for the life of me find it at the moment, but nonetheless I'm not really sold on the ex-drummer's criticisms since we've seen these guys play the Embryonic Anomaly at full speed live.
p579
aVI saw them live when they were touring with The Faceless, and *every* song started and ended with Mann running to his Mac laptop behind some amps, and I heard absolutely no action noises from his playing. Way too clean and seemingly not on time, just like this video.
p580
aVMaybe. I haven't seen them live. I think it might be a little bit of both, in a way. The drummer did admit that he could barely play the material. And with the criticism, it doesn't make a ton of sense that Lucas wouldn't put up playthroughs. He did one for Invasion later on, garage quality, and some of the solos and stuff. I don't know. They both could have reason to be trying to trash the other side.
p581
aVNo need to worry, I highly doubt he's going to get more than $2200 before his campaign runs out. I wouldn't really mind if he came out and said "ya, I cant play this live" or if he didn't make videos of his playthroughs on an obvious MIDI track, but seriously, thats crossing a line. \u000a
p582
aVwhen you think about how [Hannes Grossmann only needs ~5500$](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-radial-covenant-solo-album) for his solo album, which will probably be &gt;9000 times as good....
p583
aVIt's clearly MIDI guitar programming. People like this are the reason society doesn't work. There's a link in the bottom right hand sidebar saying "Do you think this campaign contains prohibited content?\u000aLet us know." for anyone who cares enough to report this unscrupulous campaign. \u000a
p584
aVIs it just my phone being weird or were his fingers clearly not doing the same thing as the audio track? If so, yeah, that's just embarrassing and lame.
p585
aVI see the same thing when watching. He's playing along what sounds like a well-sampled midi track exported from guitar pro, and I'm pretty damn sure he plays some parts at half speed and then speeds the video up to full speed. Especially at 1:27.
p586
aVThat's without a doubt him miming along to Guitar Pro playback.  I can't confirm that anything's sped up in the vid, but I thought that while watching as well.  I just don't understand how he thought it would be an awesome idea, after all the previous shitstirring, to make this video and think that it WOULDN'T raise more doubts about his abilities.  Or maybe he thought that no one would notice?  WTF...
p587
aVWhat a prick.  If you can't play full speed then don't fake it.  Play something you're comfortable playing and make it awesome.  Dick
p588
aV[He ended up getting $1,060 HAHAHA](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lucas-mann-solo-album)\u000a\u000aI honestly thought he was going to get 10k thanks to these aliencore swagfags but I guess not
p589
aVWhy can't any artists today earn their own money?  I find this a little weird since he is begging for money, and on the internet none the less.\u000a\u000aI'm glad he was found out and proved he was cheating as /u/IsolatedWolf said.  \u000a\u000aThis is somewhat off topic kinda... But I noticed most people on those Indigogo, Kickstarter, Gimmie your damn money because I don't want to use my own websites are sometimes scamming people out of their hard earned change by not giving them what they were promised or money back because the goal wasn't reached. \u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEdit:  Who the FUCK needs 20k to record an album?   Am I missing somthing or reading the page wrong?  Feel free to correct me.
p590
aVApparently he needs/wants 20k, but I've seen artists do it for far less (like [Krimh](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/explore), asking around 6.5k). Unless he's getting top of the line *everything* he shouldn't need even half of 20k.
p591
aVHe's supposedly hoping to be getting the best of the best recording, mixing, mastering, and studio drummer tracking and an extremely expensive flight and trip to this top-of-the-line studio.
p592
aVKnew it was Mann before I even opened the link. The whole situation is unfortunate. Sure, record your stuff at half speed to get the desired tight effect. But don't straight up lie about it and make a "play along" video where you mime to a Guitar Pro track. \u000a\u000aYou know, now that I think about it, this is all rather reminiscent of the whole Al Mu'min issue.

aVAbsolutely wonderful. The pacing, riffs, ambiance, lyrics, and heaviness are all pitch perfect to me. My favorite album so far this year. Time will tell but l really get the feeling I will be coming back to this for years. I can't stop listening to it.  
p649
aVI overall enjoy it.
p650
aVOne of the only Metal albums I've enjoyed in a really long time.
p651
aVAs a whole it's well done, but some of the creative decisions in its mixing / mastering aren't to my personal taste, eg. it's over compressed / limited. Also, and maybe this is just because I've only listened to it 4 or 5 times, but the songs all kind of blend into one big piece, as though variations on a theme and as such there aren't very many parts that sound unique and dare I say, catchy, like on previous releases. Either way I like that it's grandiose and almost cinematic. 87/100
p652
aVthe three songs they released early completely blew me away, and made my hype boner even stronger. But after listening to the entire album about 5 times through ive found none of the other songs really stand out or blow the mind like ending of sapphire or carved from stone
p653
aVI feel like there is way too much filler ambiance for only 40 mins, that should be an extra once you have a respectable album length. I really like Carved from Stone but the rests of the songs are a bit same-ish. 
p654
aVI'm really disappointed by most of the album, it feels like literally every song they stop playing riffs and just tremolo pick this shitty melody and scream over it with a blast beat.  I absolutely can't stand that shit.\u000a\u000aCase and point, first song 3 minutes in they have a nice riff going and then for no reason they play a really really shitty tremolo melody transition into the solo.  If they took out every part of the album where they play that exact same shitty melody, it would be one of the best metal albums I've ever heard.  But instead they played that shitty melody in almost every song.\u000a\u000aIt starts 1 minute into the second song, a minute and thirty into the third song.  Again throughout the 4th song without the screaming and then fully fledged by the end.  They don't play it in Levitation which is why it's one of my favorite songs on the album.  The 6th song is basically an album lengthener with nothing interesting to report.  The rest of the album is good, but overall I feel like they were really lazy with their songwriting and the album should have been a lot better.\u000a
p655
aVI like it but its a little to.."ambient" for my liking. Its suffering from the same reason why I didn't like Fleshgod's Labyrinth...too much overbearing orchestra which drowned out the actual metal.
p656
aVProbably one of the top tech death albums this year.\u000a\u000aMy only gripe with the band is at times the riffs seem *too* copy and paste. Not in that they are cliche in any way, but the way they are played can be so repetitive. Any band does this, but with Fallujah is seems to stand out way more for me. I think it could just be the pace at which they play.
p657
aVIncredibly boring, and the general -coreness of the album keeps taking me out of the music every time I try listening to it. Definitely not bad, but not something I like. Same goes for everything ever done by The Faceless.

p679
aVI'll be seeing them at Heavy MTL this year. Never did like them until that monstrosity known as Monolith of Inhumanity came out last year.
p680
aVI saw them on Summer Slaughter in 2006 and had never even heard of them at that point.  Live show made me a long time fan, and The Harvest Floor completely sealed the deal.  Monolith is amazing and Homovore and Humanure are pretty high up there for me to, although I wouldn't call those albums technical death metal.  Enjoy the show dude!\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IceZdfzFkBk

p772
aVI have listened to this song 1 1/2 times since I sent that. I drooled a bit halfway through. This is amazing. The bass fill wasn't as heavy as I'd like but the rest of this track was amazing. It reminded me a bit of Fleshgod minus the orchestra, and mix a little more technicality. Beautiful. 
p773
aVIkr.  I always know when a song that's playing while I'm driving is theirs cause it just sounds so fucking perfect.
p774
aVHaha. The highs were just right. I never really like highs too much but I'll be damned if those we're nearly perfect. I'm putting this album right under Archspire. Archspire released a god-tier album yesterday.

Is it single songs or bands in general you are looking for? \u000aWhat about [Carnifex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97szX86HBGE) or more aggressive like [Lost Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlyBVsMgKT0).

p927
aVI go in phases with this album. I absolutely love every second of it, but I can't help but criticize the weird guitar tone. It doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, but it is like, why the fuck didn't they add some resonance to that guitar?? its so crunchless.
p928
aVI think the guitar tone on all of the spawn of possession releases has more to do with clarity. There is a lot going on in a tonal sense that could easily be muddied by an inappropriate tone. I'm sure it could be better but it is what it is. 
p929
aVYeah, I see that point, but the tone is really lacking in the muted notes. Compared to the regularly strummed notes in the melodies, the muted ones seem to be really quiet. \u000a\u000aThat's basically what I sum it up to. They wanted every note to be super intelligible, but ended up with too little gain, and too much gating, or something. Still, I go nuts over every other riff. It's a jaw dropping album. Sometimes, I'll be sitting in my car and a solo will start, and I almost have to pull over and try to reevaluate my life.

p989
aVTo be fair, there are some other songs by this band that, although not quite in the same vein as Dying Fetus, aren't necessarily out of place here. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEwhc-e63bg) song for example was posted here before and was received relatively well by the subreddit. It starts off similarly to the song posted in this thread but it kicks up.
p990
aVTo be fair? We aren't dividing rations amongst the starving in a 3rd world country here man. This is TECHDEATH. Nothing about this submission is technical or complex. It is 'fair' to say that it's a rather simple tapping technique. The complexities and techniques used on Death I validate the reason it did so well in this subreddit. IMO this song just does not fit here.
p991
aVIt's actually rather complex when you actually look at what he's doing melodically with it(modulation, counter point, etc).  The time signature is also rather complex and jumps around a bunch (15/16, 12/16, 10/16, etc).  Not to mention the fact it requires 4 finger tapping, so I wouldn't say that this is "simple tapping technique".  Nonetheless, well received on it being the wrong genre.  My bad.
p992
aVIt's not. He's an idiot who is clearly not a musician.
p993
aVLmao, a simple tapping technique? \u000a\u000aSurely you're trolling, right?\u000a\u000aget real
p994
aVTroll, yes. Musician, yes. I love this band and saw no one was up voting or commenting on this post so I figured I would stir the pot (it was a slow night at work). I have been playing guitar since '95 and the first time I heard these guys my jaw dropped. Chris Arp is a well accomplished guitar player I have a lot of appreciation for this band and their innovation to this genre of music.

aVThey play in C# standard.  That's down 1 and a half steps on all strings.

p1031
aVThere's a lot of really cool parts to learn in this song even you don't learn the whole thing.  It also provides some cool insight into how they write songs.  It can give you a lot of cool ideas for writing your own songs.
p1032
aVI totally agree, they're a great band! Im just totally not going to tune down from D to C and then learn like 2 riffs. I'm fine with just listening to the song.  
p1033
aVYou could just change the tuning in the guitar pro file.

VCall me crazy, but I like the production on this album...
p1094
aVSame here. I feel like a lot of his points are valid criticisms but at the same time they are so minor I feel like they hardly detract. I'm not sure if a different style of production would suit their compositional style. When you have this many layers at the speed they play at things need to be sharpened a bit.
p1095
aVI'm pretty neutral to the production on this album, but I've heard only praise for it (besides this review of course). To me it doesn't come off as robotic or overly-synthetic at all. Bands like Archspire and Necrophagist do though.
p1096
aVI personally love the sound of bands like Archspire. The Lucid Collective is one of my favorite albums this year.
p1097
aVProduction sounds like plastic to me, the guitar could use some buzz.
p1098
aVI try not to care too much about production. The only time production gets in the way of me loving music is when it sounds like a Death record or when the mastering is so loud there is popping all over the record.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I personally think Archspire's album sounds exactly the way it needs to sound.
p1099
aV&gt; sounds like a Death record\u000a\u000aWhat the fuck is wrong with Death's production?
p1100
aVI can't listen to it. It just sounds like its being played through a coffee can in an echoey room to me. I can't concentrate on the music at all and just focus on how it sounds. I always try to listen to Death every few months trying to see if I dig it but end up getting about 5 minutes into the album and switching to something else. This bums me out every time.
p1101
aVWhich album(s) in particular are you talking about? \u000a
p1102
aVI can't currently recall the album name but its one of the most renowned ones. Its mainly red. It also has a re-mastered version that was released.
p1103
aVThe Sound Of Perseverance? That album has the best guitar tone I've ever heard.
p1104
aVYes, that album. My ears don't agree.
p1105
aVMaybe you might enjoy the remastered versions of Human and Individual Thought Patterns by Death. The drums and bass are a lot higher in the mix and the guitar tone is cleaned up a bit so it sounds a bit less "buzzy" if you get what I mean.
p1106
aVI am neutral to this production as well, but the biggest pont I think he made was in regard to the compression. It does sound smushed or contained to me. Much of the album is really trying to soar and spread out melodically and with the riffs and it just comes off to me as though its in a shrunk wrap an only pushing against it, not breaking through sonically. Overall I really enjoy the album and think its one of the best of the year!
p1107
aVSomeone on /r/progmetal explained it as being mixed in a way that sounded as if everything was coming at you from one direction, which I do kind of agree with. I felt it could have been more stereophonic with more spatial separation between instruments.
p1108
aVNot a very surprising review. Fantano ALWAYS complains about any technical metal sounding to clean or robotic and he always has a complaint about the production. 
p1109
aVI personally feel like if this album didn't sound as 'clean' as it does, then a lot of the intricacies of the instrumentation may have been lost.. I would say a lot of the most acclaimed tech death albums have the same 'robotic' precision sound because without it this type of music can easily descend into something that just does not sound good.\u000a\u000aLets be honest too, for every one good tech death band, there has to be *at least* a dozen that just totally fail to resonate, IMHO. It's an easy genre to miss the mark in.
p1110
aVSoreption and Fallujah both released records this year to similar complaints. Both in my mind are some of the most technical bands running at the moment.
p1111
aVI can see Soreption being a little overproduced in the drum tone but that's it.

aVIn case anybody's interested, Brewer was touring with suicidal tendencies because he did the bass for dean pleansants' upcoming solo album. They were doing two songs off it live, and then Evan played some Infectious Grooves covers with ST.\u000a

p1201
aVThey recently started using backing tracks so that they could add in those extra guitar harmonies and effects that would appear on the album, so yeah, I'd say they probably had that going on at this gig.  They were fucking tight before, but the backing tracks do give it an extra edge.

Pretty excited for that, even if they're moving to Canada.\u000a\u000aArkaik have been teasing something due next year as well, that should be fun.

VI cannot get enough of this album at the moment! I notice a lot of people are neg on the vocals, but I think they are work really well with the this bands tone. I can't imagine high/mid vocals sound sounding any good on this album at all. Having said that I do feel that if the vocals where mixed with more volume it probably wouldn't work either.
p1267
aVI really wish I could get into this album. The vocals just sound like someone doing gutterals while you have your head in the toilet and continually flush. 
p1268
aVIt's part of the appeal
p1269
aVI guess it just doesn't appeal to me. I've always liked mid to higher harsh vocals sprinkled in with some lows, but I've never liked just constant low as you can go gutterals that are incomprehensible.

aVThis album is pretty good. Gave it a rating of 8/10.

aVAbsorbing Black Ignition (track 2) is my favorite. Like groovy black metal.\u000a\u000aVocals aren't my favorite, and they are mixed too light. Otherwise this album kicks ass

sVBeyond Creation
p1293
(lp1294
VBeyond Creation are definitely unique, but they aren't the only bands out there with bass guitar being prominent in the mix. Augury and Obscura (the first two bands that come to mind when I think of that tone) both use fretless six-strings (well, to be fair, the bassist for Augury is also the bassist for Beyond Creation). Definitely recommend checking out Augury for a similar but less aggressive vibe (Fragmentary Evidence was amazing, wish they would release another album). \u000a\u000aI don't think Augury is a one-of-a-kind band though. I thought the same thing when Demilich's Nespithe came out, and I've heard Demilich worship bands and other similar bands since then. Anyway, I'm rambling, but Augury and Obscura are good options (oh, and the last Quo Vadis album had a somewhat prominent fretless tone, although it's less brutal than Beyond Creation by quite a bit.
p1295
aVI should have mentioned that Obscura is another favorite of mine to spare you . But holy beautiful bass guitar, Augury. Thanks for that suggestion. The fact that they're not as aggressive as Beyond Creation is actually quite fitting here. I don't know how these guys avoided my attention for such a long time. Thanks again. 
p1296
aVYeah, I remember listening to Augury after getting turned onto Quo Vadis six or seven years ago. Fragmentary Evidence came out and they were around for one of the only times they've come to the East Coast, and my jaw dropped. They sounded good on the album, but they just blew me away live. Sadly this was right before Forest left the band (he rejoined later), but they had I believe Christian who was a session bassist for MAG (an offshoot of the Augury guitarist). Great show, and I've loved them ever since. There's a good chance any of Forest's other bands would interest you, since his music that he plays tends to be very distinct.
p1297
aVI didn't even check to just see what other bands Forest played for and I feel pretty stupid for not doing so . I must say though , this guy is pretty talented in my opinion . Thanks for turning me on to more of his work because I'm not looking forward to overplaying The Aura like I've done to Gorod's " A Perfect Absolution ".
p1298
aVAlso check out the radial covenant! It's a crowdfunded album by obscura's drummer Hannes Grossman. It also has obscura's bassist and a lot more really talented musicians. 
p1299
aVNo problem, bud. A Perfect Absolution was sweet, but I prefer Neurotripsicks. I liked all their albums, especially the latest two, but Neurotripsicks is just so catchy for me and I love the tone. Leading Vision is also good, and Process is the album that exposed me to them, but I hate the production on Process. Definitely like how the production doesn't sound so sterile on APA and the Transcendence EP.
p1300
aVGorod's just one of those bands that has yet to disappoint me , through any of their work . Same goes for Obscura . As you said , the production on APA was just gritty enough to be perfect or at least nearly perfect . The only thing I haven't been able to cope with is the ending of their songs . When you're in the middle of head banging to those catchy riffs and then all of a sudden the next song comes on but your head is still thinking about the last . 
p1301
aVI definitely hear that. Some of their riffs are just so crazy good but don't last long enough / end easily.
p1302
aVAs people have already mentioned, Augury, Obscura, Quo Vadis, and Teramobil are perfect recommendations.
p1303
aVTry [Augury](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DPW9ED1WBs) (less techy and more proggy) or [teramobil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDhjvNo68sg)(full on technical death metal here, holy shit) if you don't mind instrumental stuff.\u000a\u000aBoth have Forest.\u000a\u000aEdit: added links
p1304
aVI've heard of Teramobil before and I'll definitely give them a try. Augury was a good recommendation from you and a previous poster. Definitely listening to more of their stuff and checking out Teramobil. Thanks, mate.

p1313
aVNecrophagist - Epitaph
p1314
aVGreat album in the history of technical death metal but it's in no way similar to Beyond Creation. The only prominent bass I remember coming out of Necrophagist was on the track Only Ash Remains . 
p1315
aV? Then you didn't listen very well.
p1316
aVGive the albums The Aura and Cosmogenesis a listen and then refer back to Necrophagist. The Bass Guitars are very different . Suimez is the attention of Necrophagist . Great music but the bass just doesn't match that of Beyond Creation . The sweeping and the riffs on that album are legendary but the fretless bass being played on these albums so very different to my ears . I may be a little off, however. It's been a whole since I heard that album , with all of the good stuff being released lately and Necrophagist remaining dormant . You know what I mean? If you haven't listened to all of " The Aura " you should do it though. And Obscura's entire discography. These guys take it to another level when it comes to making riffs and focusing on the bass. " Choir of Spirits " shows Obscura's talents very well if you want a direct song to listen to . ( Sorry for no links. I'm on my phone. )
p1317
aVI've listened to it all bud.
p1318
aVoh, I forgot to mention though, you are right that the bass is much more prominent in Beyond Creation and Obscura. when I said "you didn't listen very well" I was only referring to your comment that Only Ash Remains is the only song in which you can find prominent bass. Stabwound has some amazing bass work that comes about a few times as the song repeats over that part again, for instance.
p1319
aVAh . It was a misunderstanding , I see. I forgot about the bass in Stabwound but Only Ash Remains is what comes to mind with that leading riff that's so freakishly catchy .

VIf I knew there was a tech death band playing in Santa Rosa, I would have gone :(
p1386
aVWhen does their album come out? Unique Leader has been killing it recently.
p1387
aVAwesome, I used to practice there when they first opened up.
p1388
asVORIGIN - Manifest Desolate (new song 2014)
p1389
(lp1390
Vnot feeling anything from this song tbh
p1391
aVYa me too. As a big fan, I hope the rest of the album is less meh
p1392
aVSeems to me like it's missing some... aggression? 
p1393
aVAfter a couple of times this song really grew on me.\u000a\u000aI think it may have been that the song is relatively "easy" for Origin standards. 
p1394
aVYou're right. I like it more now after listening to it for a while. I guess it just sounded so different from what I expected. Looking forward to the rest of the album.
p1395
aVSame here. I will definitely buy it on the release date! 
p1396
aVyes.\u000a\u000amy body is ready.
p1397
aVThis is a disappointment, the drums I like, but the guitar not so much. I'll have to hear this in context to the rest of the album to really see if I like it or not. This song by itself, merr.

aVI agree, I want a world destroying monster. If only we could get one of the Tech Death artists to make us one. 
p1411
aVGuys at No clean singing are always posting artwork on facebook.

p1413

asVThe New Emeth album, Aethyr is album of the year material.
p1425
(lp1426
VAlbum of the year material sounds accurate to me. This is fucking outstanding.
p1427
aV&gt;XTREEM MUSIC  \u000aFUCKING ALL TRENDS SINCE 1990\u000a\u000aHeh, nice motto. Super lame name for a label, but a pretty humorous motto.
p1428
aVLike triangles and bullshit hippie spirituality isn't a fucking trend LMAO That album art is terrible.
p1429
aVIn the beginning I found it pretty mediocre, but I must recognize it has grown on me eventually. Anyway, it's been a fantastic year for Death Metal IMO (technical or not).
p1430
asVSOREPTION Guitar Recording "Engineering The Void"
p1431

VI'm looking forward to their new album!

p1458
aVdamn is sleep terror still making music?
p1459
asVSynesis Absorption - Forever Untouched (Joe Haley + Mike Smith now!)
p1460
(lp1461
VRegardless of how awesome a bassist Steve DiGorgio may be, someone needs to tell him to shut that damn flanger off.  I don't know about you guys, but it doesn't fit at all, IMO.
p1462
aVI didn't like it at first but it's grown on me.  
p1463
aVI wouldn't mind it in moderation, but it's used almost everywhere in this song.  I guess it's a way to make the bass stand out, though.
p1464
aVYeah, he really plays the phaser effect on certain parts.  I think those are the parts that don't sound right.  When it's in the mix it sounds fine.
p1465
aVI'm trying to work out just what sort of effect it is.  It sounds like a flanger at some parts, a phaser at others, but it also sounds kind of like a low/high-pass filter or ring modulator when it gets that "water drops in a cave" sound to it.  It'd be a cool effect to experiment with, anyway.
p1466
aVIt sounds like a badly compressed MP3 file from 2001.
p1467
aVGuitars are mixed shit. And I'm disappointed to not see Joe Haley in this video.
p1468
aVThat drum mix is really good.  
p1469

p1481
aVHey look, a Unique Leader techdeath band from California. Is that 3 drinks or 4?\u000a\u000aSounds good though, will likely pick their old stuff up, as well as the new album when it comes out.

aVYup, I've posted some others before just not as many as I should.  
p1508
aVthis is quite heavy
p1509
aVRussian bands have a particularly punishing approach.
p1510
aVI thought Putridity was from Italy? 
p1511
aVYou're right.  I was thinking of Abonimable Putridity.  
p1512
asVCryptopsy - Two Pound Torch
p1513
(lp1514
VOf all bands out there, the two I could never get into are cryptopsy and morbid angel. I appreciate what they have done, and what they mean to the metal community, but their music just doesn't seem to click with me.
p1515
aVThey're definitely a VERY niche market - even for tech death fans. I do like their combination of brutality and groove. Their vocals take some getting used to as well. But in my opinion they're great because you rarely get bored of them - it's not just relentless blast beats.

p1555
aVTheres two newer songs released so far. They are "Lairs of the Ascended Masters" and "Banishment" 
p1556
aVsweet, thanks.
p1557
asVLast Sacrament - Enantiodromia
p1558
(lp1559
VJust learned my friend plays in this band out of FL. They are a microtonal metal band, so I think this belongs here in technical metal? Either way, hope you guys enjoy! This [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWCwMW48FO4) is an interview with the lead guitarist, very interesting to watch.
p1560
aVThis belongs in /r/doommetal 
p1561
aVWhile I am not sure if this belongs in this sub or not, I am pretty sure it would not belong in Doommetal. Doommetal is slow, deep and imposes the feeling of "dread and dispair". This sub from the sidebar explains "death metal with more complex musicianship and song structure." This is actually a cross post from /r/deathmetal, but I forgot to put that in the title. If this is indeed the incorrect place for this post, I can remove it or an admin can of course.\u000a\u000aedit: If this helps any, here is [some info](https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Ron+Sword) on front man Ron Sword. I am not a musician myself, but from what I understand... he is a technical musician. That is not to say this qualifies his band as Technical Death Metal.\u000a\u000aedit 2: Actually, my apologies. They are according to their bandcamp page: avant garde, death metal, doom, experimental metal, microtonal. I think I got hung up on the microtonal aspect of their music and came over to here. 
p1562
aVThis is not doom metal... Although it definitely has elements of Death/Doom.
p1563

p1574
aVBrought By Pain are a great band. I've seen them opening for Beyond Creation a couple of years ago in a bar, south of Montral. Great show, the singer is a beast on stage.
p1575
aVI guess Forest is onto other projects?
p1576
aVAugury and Teramobil!
p1577
aVCompletely spaced on the new Augury album and now I'm super pumped for that.
p1578
aVI have never been so excited for a new album than I am for that one. Can't wait to see them live again too.\u000a\u000aThat and the new Humanoid album should be interesting too. Pretty sure Forest is making an appearance on it as well.

V[Son of Aurelius](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QajuLclBIUU) and [Dissonance in Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_P3i69D9lc) are both technical, melodic and not yet mentioned.

p1592
aV[Vale of Pnath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1V__kzkIdw)
p1593
aVOkay. You're good.
p1594
aV[Neuraxis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4YDzwhj_E) is pretty damn good too.
p1595
aVThose fuckin Candians know their metal. But these are bands that I like. I can't stand bands like Rings of Saturn, yes they know how to play but it just is too dissonant and there's nothing that sticks in my head.
p1596
aVI sort of agree there with Rings of Saturn, though I will say their second album was a massive step in the right direction.
p1597
aVThey recorded their first album at half speed. Source: http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/06/more-rings-of-saturn-drama-ex-drummer-brent-silletto-shares-his-side-of-the-story/

They are talented guys and deserve credit. I enjoy their music and they don't deserve half the shit they get. 
p1600
aVI've been out of the scene for a bit. What the fuck is this shit?\u000aRings of Saturn are goddamn great.
p1601
aVThanks for that, never came across them before. Currently listening to [Sightless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zEoAP7Qpg4) again and again!
p1602
aVObscura is very similar to beyond creation
p1603
aVObvious choice is [Augury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hlSMQ-_WAU) (same bass player as in Beyond Creation). Maybe less melodic but more technical would be [Martyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_moWrwOvTeo), also from Quebec. [Gorod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCNxvZLmlQo) is also worth mentioning (surprised no-one else has brought them up yet).
p1604
aV[Arsis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHC9w7pCIMQ) - about as technical as it gets, but never losing sight of a melody.
p1605
aVTry Fallujah. They are technical and melodic with brutality
p1606
aVYeah Fallujah are awesome. But I didn't think they were techdeath?
p1607
aVThey're a good mixture of many things, it's hard to put them into one category. If you haven't heard already listen to the album "the harvest wombs." I think that might be what you're going for
p1608
aVYes!!!! I love this band 
p1609
aVeven though it's only a couple days old I've come back to this post several times for my own reference. There's some good stuff here.\u000a\u000arecently Ive been listening to [Auras](http://youtu.be/QHq_v1br-B0) and especially [Anomalous](http://youtu.be/Ef2Jn9zqWm4)

p1617
aVWell there's At the Gates, Quo Vadis, and Arch Enemy, but I'm sure you know of them and they are a bit off from what you asked for but noteworthy nonetheless.\u000a\u000aI think [Anata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6Dm42zSec) fits the bill for melodic techdeath better than most other bands out there.\u000a\u000aJust heard of [Wretched](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtKgveqZFlw) recently, they are pretty fuckin' killer.\u000a\u000a[Necrophagist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9RJXWxth5g), although they tend to be pretty hit and miss for people.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aHeathen Shrine is a friend's band that put out some seriously kick ass music, they only have 5 high quality recorded song on the internet and only two are on youtube (they have all 5 on spotify though). I'm not positive that they plan on putting anything else out though (life has a tendency to interrupt people's plans).\u000a\u000aYoutube links:\u000a\u000a* [I am Rasputin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sq8pGDSM08)\u000a\u000a* [Caster of Stones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYgCvp1_nek)\u000a\u000aSpotify link to (IMO) their best song and the rest of the album: https://play.spotify.com/album/638QfYcyhPH4lSxaxf20P8

aVI wouldn't say that At The Gates are Tech Death. THey are just Melodeath. And At The Gates are the creators of Tech Death overall. Still great and ATG is my favorite band

aVThey're alright. When I used to like core more I listened to them.

aVInferi are pretty good, if you don't mind a teensy-bit of metalcore styling. Malcolm Pugh from Diskreet/Enfold Darkness is the lead guitarist and shreds hard throughout.

p1654
aVIt's deathcore, and the first album (and likely the second) were recorded at half speed and pro-tools'd to hell.\u000a\u000aBut damn if it isn't fun to listen to!
p1655
aV&gt; the first album (and likely the second) were recorded at half speed and pro-tools'd to hell.\u000a\u000aThere's zero actual evidence they recorded at half-speed on either albums and the producer on Dingir (at least) stated himself that it wasn't recorded at 1/2.
p1656
aVThat's last I heard. The drummer detailed everything about the first album. Dunno how reliable it all is though, but I rather thought it made sense.
p1657
aVEven if they recorded at half speed, it would be for the sake of production quality. They have no problem playing the material live.

VI don't know why everyone on FB is chanting "Necrophagist reunion!"\u000a\u000aHe's leaving because he has to take it easy and wants to work on his own stuff, NF isn't his own stuff and arguably as technically challenging as Obscura. Do people read posts by their favorite musicians or just comment on their own desires?
p1670
aVIt puzzled me because Necrophagist replaced them a long time ago.  
p1671
aVWonder if Munzy is going to quit Spawn of Possession as well - that stuff can't be easy to play either. 
p1672
aVWhat? NOOOOOO!
p1673
aVI'm still baffled muenzer is able to play with FD.
p1674
aVTook me a second to figure out what "FD" was\u000a\u000a&gt; A second crucial factor in my decision was that I am still dealing with a neurologic condition in my fretting hand called Focal Dystonia, which almost took the ability to play guitar away from me completely by late 2011/early 2012.\u000a\u000aYeah, I can't think of a better reason to take a break than that.
p1675
aVI'm kinda sad now.
p1676
aVThat sucks.
p1677
aV&gt; Due to the mentioned lineup changes recordings for the yet untitled fourth album have to be postponed to the end of 2014. To replace both, Christian Muenzner and Hannes Grossmann, a row of auditions will be launched soon.\u000a\u000aGood to know they're not giving up.

VWow, hadn't heard anything from these guys in years! Great band... I just assumed they'd broken up.
p1689
aVYeah, these guys kick ass.\u000a\u000aMP3s of Joyless Parson have been floating around for years, but they just recently had it professionally mastered and finally gave it an official release. The vocals are a lot more prominent on the original, which I prefer, but both versions are worth listening to.\u000a\u000aIf you are interested, Orgone's guitarist/lyricist/vocalist has been active in some alternative rock side projects that share a lot in common with Orgone, both musically and lyrically. Here are some bandcamp links:\u000a\u000a[Miracle Worker](http://miracleworkerus.bandcamp.com) - Quirky, mutant alternative rock. Catchy, yet gross. I think only an extreme metal musician could come up with alternative rock like this. It's like Weezer meets Orgone.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Meadow](http://meadowus.bandcamp.com) - Sort of shoegazey. I posted this to /r/shoegaze and it got downvoted to oblivion though, LOL. I think the sour bent notes (and somewhat out of tune singing?) turned people there off.

p1714
aVthis album has been in heavy rotation for me for the last couple years. its a shame that whatever they come out with in the future will most likely not be this immaculate, given that Malcolm probably won't be on it. Inferi is amazing but it is a bit more symphonic and busy than i like. this is the perfect mix of tech and brutality imo.

asVQuo Vadis - On The Shores of Ithaka (Live)
p1768
(lp1769
VI like me some Quo Vadis, but apart from a few complex leads, the "technical" label that they tend to get goes over the top of my head a lot of the time (not counting flashy solos, because solos in metal are often technical, regardless of subgenre).  Maybe I just haven't listened to enough of their material - I only have *Defiant Imagination*, after all.

aVDying to hear new material from these guys!
p1772
aVSeen them live not to long ago, the only remaining member is Bart (the guitarist with the beard)...they played a new song but i couldn't hear shit due to the terrible sound in that venue...amazing band nonetheless
p1773
aVI really hope I'll be able to see them live some time in the future. I was glad I was at least able to see Martyr right before they went 'on hold' and Nevermore right before they broke up.

VSo the guy wears your user name ?  Self promotion ?
p1777
aVnot quite, Xenocide broke up last year and I moved on to Exterminatus.  He just happens to be wearing a xenocide shirt haha
p1778
aVI suppose the ironic thing about that is that he wasn't even the drummer from Xenocide, yet he chose to wear the shirt. Hehe. I saw your username and checked out the vid because my wife used to work with the drummer from Xenocide. Was interested to see if you were him. As it turns out, nope! Small world though. 
p1779
aVHe (exterminatus drummer) will be recording drums for the next 2 xenocide singles and editing drums for the final xenoalbum. Even though xenocide broke up last year theres still quite a bit of material that will be released

p1792
aVSeparatist is great.
p1793
aVI didn't like the first half of that album, but it grew on me. Listening to Id now though, immediately loving it.
p1794
aVYea there are a few songs on that album that seem like they are dragging on and clean vocals that don't belong, but the instrumentation is great.  I think ill just go ahead and give Id some money, its gonna happen eventually anyway.
p1795
aVJust spent $6.66 on the Id album thanks to you.

p1817
aVI'm pretty sure Decrepit Birth said something about releasing new material this year. I'm sure everyone here knows who they are. Otherwise that new necrophagist album comes out on 4/1 and that's supposed to be pretty good.
p1818
aVYou're a sick bastard with that fake Necrophagist tease.  Works every time, i bet....
p1819
aVHa he got me at first. I was like...otherwise, necrophagist, 4/1, ohhhhhh

aVInanimate Existence has one in the works. 
p1821
aV[I was on board til about 1:50.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gX_DUcMNmo)  I just don't like clean vocals at all.  Completely ruins it for me.  I'll probably just edit it out like I have on other albums.
p1822
aVedit it out? you actually do that?
p1823
aVI'm really looking forward to both Alterbeast's album as well as Archspire's album. That's all that's on my radar so far
p1824
aVDitto, but I'm sure there are loads more of good extreme metal coming out. 
p1825
aVOh yeah, I know. I'm sure there are a few albums I'm forgetting about. Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head. I can't keep up with all of the fantastic stuff that has come out recently 
p1826
aVKeep Fallujah on your radar then. They're recording at the moment.
p1827
aVOh yeah, I totally forgot they were recording. I also didn't realize that Beyond Creation was recording either.

p1833
aVPyrrhon will throw their newest abomination at us on April 1st.  \u000aBlack Crown Initiate and Fallujah will also probably release something new this year.
p1834
aVOh, and I don't know if it will be techdeath or not, but Wes Hauch &amp; Ryan Glisan are working on something with the former bassist for Decapitated, which could be really good. They put something on YouTube last year, and Wes put up another teaser on his Instagram recently. 
p1835
aVOuroboros was supposed to have a new album in 2013, but since that had come and gone. So I'm hoping it will be a 2014 release.
p1836
aVContinuum - The Hypothesis\u000a\u000aHas members of Decrepit Birth, Animosity, Arkaik, Deeds of Flesh, Flesh Consumed, and Son of Aurelius.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtbYEgxiFyo\u000a\u000aOther than the two bands you mentioned also looking forward to new stuff from Psycroptic, Beyond Creation, Hideous Divinity, Sons of Aurelius, The Zenith Passage, First Fragment and Ouroborus this year. 
p1837
aVnew Origin has me frothing at the mouth. Also, I think its safe to say that Decrepit Birth and Obscura will probably release something this year. Another thing Im looking forward to, although it might be more jazz fusion-y, is Nufutic's debut. They have members of Obscura and Sadist!

p1922
(lp1923
VPretty fucking sweet guys. OMAAF is an Alabama four-piece that had a new album out on October 15th. Their name is short for Of Men and Angel's Flesh. What does your name mean? \u000a\u000ahttps://omaaf.bandcamp.com/  oooh full album.
p1924
aVSorry for the super late response.  The name comes man's desire to be closer to perfection.  In the mythical tales of the bible apparently man wanted to be like the angels, yet the the angels were jealous of man and wanted to be more like them.  Angels were not allowed any of the emotions or freedom that man was.  Though the angel's were considered near perfection as their status was closer to god they were actually prisoners damned to eternity never to feel and never to love.  The name was a metaphor for the irony that is "perfection" and the prison that perfection really is.  Obtaining such a thing would make one less human.  I always imagined the image of a man standing in a room, sorrowfully squeezing into an angel costume (or a suit made of an angel flesh) and in the next room a angel putting on a human costume.  The title for the song "angelskingarden" by crpytopsy was the catalyst for the name.  The meaning was an idea I had floating around in my head for over 10 years.  Also thank you very much for your interest and time.  \u000a\u000aAndy Knight (OMAAF)

aVThe main reason that I think Inferi will remain in the top spot is 65 minutes vs 28 minutes. Based off the songs that have been released, Alterbeast will get a perfect rating from me right along with Inferi. 
p1994
aVAh yeah good point, definitely got more content with the Inferi album. I'm still excited to hear the rest of the Alterbeast release nonetheless!

p2085
aVCome on man. Read the sidebar first, listen to all those albums, then arrange by top posts all time. You really should automatically be doing that before asking where do I start. 
p2086
aVyeah, you are right.
p2087
aVWhich band out of those 3 did you prefer?
p2088
aVI liked Origin and Necrophagist.\u000aI felt like Nile had some interrupting things in their music I dont know why .But when they play,it sounds amazing.I have listened the album sth like "Those Gods whom Detest" from Nile.\u000aI have listened Origin's Antithesis and Entity albums.They sound amazing too!\u000aAnd finally Quo Vadis.I liked this guys but they have been soooo brutal for me.So I think I will keep them for later.
p2089
aVI can tell you that Quo Vadis is the less brutal out of all of them, as for your answer:\u000a\u000a Maybe try \u000a\u000a-Spawn of Possession (the latest album would be good for you I think)\u000a\u000a-Decrepit Birth (anything after ...And Time Begins)  \u000a\u000a-Gorod (anything works, though I personally only like their 1st and 2nd album)\u000a\u000aYou should revisit Nile and Origin when you feel ready too\u000a\u000aOrigin : Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas and Echoes of Decimation\u000a\u000aNile : Annihilation of the Wicked mostly\u000a\u000aThey are much more brutal than their latest offerings though, so be prepared.
p2090
aVthen its my bad,because I havent listened Quo Vadis for like 3-4 months.\u000aI will definitely check them today!
p2091
aVAnd time begins kicked ass dude
p2092
aVIt really does, it's my favorite one actually. OP just doesn't seem ready to dwelve into TBDM territory
p2093
aVI started with [Archspire,](http://youtu.be/vB3Nv-9RxrE) if you like Necrophagist they shouldn't be much of a stretch. On that note, [Obscura](http://youtu.be/mesr2siegRg) might be a good choice, since they're like 2/5ths Necrophagist anyways. [Cryptopsy](http://youtu.be/zQ_2MmuIbcc) is fairly tech-y, some people do t like the vocals, but everything else more than makes up for them. [Beyond Creation](http://youtu.be/v0MkJtI3FvU) is Number One Best Ever. 
p2094
aVthanks for your answer!\u000aand why dont like obscura's vocals?
p2095
aVYou mean cryptopsy? I'm not sure, I like them fine, but I've seen quite a few people complain about them.

(lp2252
VI just picked up the album and I've listened to it once all the way through. First impression: I was a bit disappointed. It is in the same vein as The Agony though I feel that this album is less memorable. It's like they took a step back in their songwriting and melodies and just blast away. It all kind of ran together after a while. Maybe the subtleties of this album will present themselves with more listens but I felt rather unimpressed at first. And the solos blow.
p2253
aVThis about sums up my feelings as well. It lacks flow and melody; seems a bit unpolished in the writing.
p2254
aVI felt like that at first. Give it a few more listens and then make up your mind. There is a lot going on musically and the guitar riffs can sound a bit bogged down and difficult to hear. I'd recommend listening with a quality pair of headphones for an improved experience. 
p2255
aVUpon first listen, I was kind of unimpressed, Minotaur and Elegy were the only tracks that stuck out to me. But after several repeated listening sessions, I have started to pick up more of what's going on. This was the case with Agony as well. There is a lot going on at one time and I don't believe listening to this release just once or twice is giving it a fair chance. The riffs are actually fucking stellar. I'm really stoked about this album and I think from a musical perspective this is their best release. I do however still love the style of Oracles and Mafia as well. This is definitely an improvement over Agony. 
p2256
aVI didn't know, I'll check it out.
p2257
aVProduction is my only big complaint.
p2258
aVI really wanted to like it, but with the exception of a couple catchy tracks, this album will remain in the shadows of much more interesting metal released this year.
p2259
aVI started it at work the other day and it just didn't grab me enough to get all the way through. Very technically proficient, but I didn't feel like it was anything new and just became very blah half way through.

aVAlbum has a different feel than Agony which felt more insular - feel like it was due to the album concept and the use of Paolo's high cleans. Labyrinth feels more operatic and epic - I chalk this up to the increased use of Veronica Bordacchini's soprano and a bit to the widened production.\u000a\u000aIf you liked Agony you're more likely to like Labyrinth. Finding "Fall of Asterion" one of those repeat-type songs - the right-side bell hits at 2:00 are addicting.
p2261
aVLove it. Minotaur and Fall of Asterion are my favorites
p2262
aV[deleted]
p2263
aVI really like it. I think it sounds like what Agony was suppose to sound like, but they just hadn't hit the mark yet. Although I highly doubt that any of their albums will ever be as good as Oracles or Mafia. Still, much better than Agony in my book.
p2264
aVI don't think I can pick a favorite track but Minotaur's intro is crushing and the verse riffs in Elegy are excellent as well. Towards the sun and warpledge are also quickly becoming favorites. The solos have always been kind of meh for me as well. They are very well executed but also really simple. But I think part of the reason the solos are so simple is to offset how intense the rest of the music is.

VJust a general trend I'm presuming. These kind of vocals aren't just used in 'core music, but in lots of math metal, 'postish' material and lots of hybrid genres.\u000a\u000aGiven that death metal has become more eclectic in recent years, and I could see how  characteristics from other genres become incorperated into it.\u000a\u000a

aVLord Worm and Chalky both have their own styles that can't really be replaced, so there's that.
p2297
aVThere's still tons of singers out there that can do traditional death growls.
p2298
aVThe growls are harder to do.  One possible reason.  My main beef is the rising popularity of clean singing in all metal.  I mean jesus.  There's one band I listen to that went the other way... started with clean singing and eliminated it from their later albums :)
p2299
aVwhich band?
p2300
aVIn some cases, it's probably simply a stylistic choice on the band's part.  I did hear something about Psycroptic's members saying they decided to change for the sake of wider appeal, though, which may also apply to some other bands out there.

Christian said back in December that the book had been removed from sale and anyone who bought it previously would be sent the correct tabs.\u000aLast update on this was yesterday, I think once Christian has finished his new solo album he's going to work on the tabs.

p2445
aVThe band has since posted an update, here's the quote: "Hi everyone, Simon here.\u000aI would like to clarify some information about the fact that Dominic will no longer be part of the band. We know that Dominic\u2019s contribution to Beyond Creation was a big inspiration for many of you and we can definitely say that he is an incredible bass player with a lot of skills and groove. But for some personal reasons, there was a decision to take and this does not mean that Beyond Creation stops with it.\u000aI have composed all the music and lyrics on both albums and a big part of the arrangements but each musician wrote their own arrangements and solos to put their feels on it. I also manage the business and the booking for the band and I have the chance to work and play with Kevin and Philippe that are incredibly talented musicians. I\u2019ve started the band with high ambitions and dreams, and none of that has or will change\u2026. This is only the beginning of a long career for Beyond Creation.\u000aWe are all looking at the same goals and we will definitely continue to play, tour and record music for a long time.\u000aDo not worry, we will make sure to have a new bassist able to play and compose high quality arrangements , just like Dom has for our 2 current albums.\u000aDominic still our good friend and we know he will continue to shred the bass with his other bands and future projects.\u000aWe have big tours announcement coming soon and a lot of good things on the way so thanks to all of you for your support and we hope to see you on the road."

aVAll of them :-P.  Seriously though, when I first got into them, Psycroptic were very obscure (being from Tasmania, understandable).  Their two albums, The Isle of Disenchantment and The Scepter of the Ancients, blew me away.  If you haven't heard them, I highly recommend listening to those two albums first.  If the poor recording quality bothers you, it gets better on their third album.  :)

aVThey were the most technical death metal band around when they released that album. They basically invented the genre when they released *Piece Of Time* in 1989. People call *Symbolic* technical even though it mostly consists of power chord riffs. I'm sorry but this band pushed technical boundaries in their time. There was a time when "technical" didn't mean 300bpm sweep picking.

aVSeptuagint by Obscura has it all for someone who has never heard tech death in my opinion.

I have to admit that I'm not getting into it as much as my initial hype led me to expect. D:\u000a\u000aI've decided I don't like the clean vocals at all, and so it's a bit distracting to me.

aVThey self-identify as atmospheric death metal, but I'd definitely say it's "progressing" the genre of death metal, so perhaps progressive could be used to describe them.

aVThey're prog something for sure. Last release was like ~~atmospheric Djent~~ ~~progressive deathcore~~ ~~you-kids-are-fucking-pussies-core~~, now this is way more death metal

aVI am sure everyone shares the same sentiments about teasers, however some probably are happier about then others just because they get to hear a small part of the music. However labels have an interest in promoting their band's new material and most bands also have an interest in promoting it as well.

aVGlad I could help! been listening to a lot of stuff haha, pretty much everything I wrote about on the blog as well as that irreversible mechanism album that I managed to get off bandcamp before they took it down. Really just trying to catch up on all the stuff that dropped in 2014 right now. My playlist is like 2,800 songs long. If you want more links let me know and I'll post some when I get home.
p2950
aVVale of Pnath are worth a listen too.
p2951
aVGreat band! 
p2952
aVThese are some angry fast tech death bands: [Vireamia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhvrCOJQ_Fk), [Malebolgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rj4tg7_5GU),\u000a[Henker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyS1BSPK5Mc),\u000a[The Infinite Within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJod0dFI15A)\u000a\u000aThis is more in the Archspire style: [First Fragment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBkjuA85rsY), [Cytotoxin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSFzMLA00xk)
p2953
aVMan, I wish Vireamia would release some new stuff. And Cytotoxin is pretty good, too. I will check out these other bands. 
p2954
aVDude no shit, where the fuck are they? That EP got (and still gets) heavy rotation at my place\u000aEdit: I just listened to Malebolgia, sick AS
p2955
aVYou might like Beneath the Massacre and Fleshgod Apocalypse, though they aren't exactly like Archspire. 
p2956
aVI'm familiar with both of them. They definitely have similar qualities. I think Archspire may be somewhat of a trend setter in their specific niche of modern death metal. 
p2957
aVI completely agree.
p2958
aVI wish Monumental Torment had a new album. It's one of the angriest things I've ever listened to. 
p2959
aVMe too! Really blistering stuff.
p2960
aVArchspire won album of the year for me. I don't think he does any inhales though. Check out the "vocal play through" video. The dude is a beast.\u000a\u000aOthers have said Monumental Torment. I'll second that. \u000a\u000aI've seen Vale of Pnath mentioned too. That's a great band. \u000a\u000aPosthumous Blasphemer is also good. Check them out. They are a little more slammy but the tech side is definitely there too. 
p2961
aVYeah, it's definitely my favorite of the year. Maybe one of the guitarists does backups in Archspire? Check out around this part in this song. I'm pretty sure it's inhales, so it could be backups: http://youtu.be/WEuiZFb2wHY?t=2m4s\u000aI haven't heard Pothumous Blashpemer, and I love slam mixed with tech stuff (there doesn't seem to be too many bands who do). I'll check them out too! 
p2962
aVIt's not clear in the video if it's inhale or not, but it is clear that it is all him... http://youtu.be/LTOxsbyEHmM\u000a\u000aThe dude is a freaking beast. I actually don't mind the inhales if that is what he's doing. He kind of just accents with them and I like when vocalists use many techniques. The dude from Acrania is pretty good at having vocal variety too.\u000a\u000aFor Posthumous Blasphemer, check out this song: http://youtu.be/Z0FlvVyTGPo
p2963
aVAh, okay. Yeah, I don't mind either. That was just me trying to find something wrong with the band if I had to be super picky ha ha. \u000aI'll check that out. Thanks for the link. 
p2964
aVNo problem. If you're interested, my top 10 albums are:\u000a\u000a1. Archspire - The Lucid Collective\u000a2. Irreversible Mechanism - Infinite Fields\u000a3. Inanimate Existence - Never Ending Cycle of Atonement\u000a4. Inferi - The Path of Apotheosis\u000a5. Fallujah - The Flesh Prevails\u000a6. Black Crown Initiate - The Wreckage of Stars\u000a7.

TORN - Torn\u000a\u000aYou may find some stuff in there that you like. If you're in to tech slam stuff, definitely check out that EP from Parasitic Extirpation. Desecravity put out a good one too.
p2965
aVThanks, I haven't heard of some of these. I still have to check out Black Crown Initiate. I know the Parasitic Extirpation guys pretty well. Great band, along with the other bands the members play in haha. 
p2966
aVHa... Small world. What other banda are they in?
p2967
aVDysentery, Abnormality, Sexcrement. I'm probably missing some others haha. The Coprocephalic guys are cool, too.
p2968
aVThe name of the band is hilarious and the album is sick so they are alright in my book.

aVI just listened to the new Son of Aurelius album, this might be what you're looking for
p3163
aVMelodic Technical Death Metal? Inferi is pretty emotional but not really saddening. I really want to see what can come up. Gorod? A Perfect Absolution... I'm just throwing out names here. 
p3164
aVTry some Christian Muenzner (spelling?).. Not all his music is tech death, and its all instrumental.. But there are some tracks that authentically feel like they could be 'love' songs, but its all in the interpretation.
p3165
aVThe sadistic motives behind berievement letters - Arsis
p3166
aVMost love songs in tech death and death metal are obscene stalking/rape/obsession-stories of some sort, haha. I think that's as close as we get. But I wouldn't mind some more lovesongs. Metalheads have feelings too!
p3167
aVhttp://youtu.be/gsHeFLL3zGk\u000a\u000aHe talks about his wife here. Not tech death, but still. 
p3168
aVi think some of the songs on Gorguts Obscura album touch on the subjects. maybe not in the way that you're looking for. look at all (except maybe the first couple) of Gorguts albums. i dont think you're going to find any clear loves songs anywhere in the genre but you can find sadness and grief in some of the bands that don't use their lyrics like a bludgeon. 
p3169
aVEvery Arsis song. 
p3170
aVWell...you probably are never going to get a "sad" vibe from tech death no matter what the lyrical content is...so maybe try drowning out the instruments and focus on lyrics alone from something like a few Arsis or Gorod songs, which in my opinion still won't do the trick. \u000a\u000aTry depressive suicidal black metal if you want sad shit, and for the love shit try power metal

p3192
aV[Spawn of Possession - Uncle Damfee @ 2:00](http://youtu.be/o19lnNqDSog?t=1m59s). It's hard to hear, but I think this is one of the best examples I know of. I couldn't appreciate this section until I saw/listened to the tabs, so I would definitely recommend checking the tab out, there's a GP5 on Rivers of Gore. 
p3193
aV[Spawn of Possession - The Evangelist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl1yCKOQQO8) - first example of loose counterpoint starts ~30sec mark. This song is full of complex harmonies, hopefully this fits the bill
p3194
aVyou may not be able to find metal that abides by the rules of counterpoint, but it sounds like you are looking for complex polyphony with interdependent harmonies. Opeth is really good for those kinds of riffs - [Opeth- The Leper Affinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufRkpTIdGYA) ~56sec   \u000aAlso Skeletonwitch has  pieces of riffs that would fit throughout their songs.   \u000aBands like Gorguts and Nero Di Marte sound like what you are looking for.

aVI don't know. Melodic Deathmetal with slight tech influences? Just ask yourself before posting something; does it hold up to the technicality of the list to the right?

VKamikabe is such a great group of dudes with a unique style of play. Their 2 guitars aren't even in the same fucking tuning.\u000a\u000aSo sad they had to drop off of the tour they're doing right now with Gorod.  They broke down again in Pennsylvania in their hometown so they just called it quits because the whole tour was getting far too expensive for them to complete, and they were only half way done :c
p3225
aVI saw Gorod and Inanimate Existence last night.  I was pretty bummed Kamikabe and Vale of Pnath weren't there.  Still an amazing show though.  The supporting bands were sick too.  Pyrexia and a local band Cognitive.

aVOddly enough Kamikabe is supposed to be playing a show to night and another one tomorrow if I'm not mistaken.\u000a\u000aCognitive is fucking awesome.  They came out for the Akron Deathfest 2 years in a row and play such great shit.

p3235
aVWhat about this song in particular? Do you feel the same way? 
p3236
aVYup
p3237
aVI mostly agree.  I like the band, but their songs oddly fall short and just aren't memorable.  They lack something -- though I don't know what specifically -- that could finally give them the bump they need to be great.  For now they're just lingering on the cusp.

p3345
aVI bought this EP and saw them open up for Suffocation. Great album, Bobby Koelble (DEATH) has a great solo on the Subservience track. I get that $8 for 5 songs may seem a little ridiculous, but bands like this without a label, pay for everything out of pocket. Artwork, cd pressing, merch, production/recording. So it was well worth the $8. Plus, they're all really cool guys. This is definitely a band I will watch out for.

p3401
aVColored Sands oh yes. I have not sat down with Artificial Brain yet, I will put that on my list. I have been listening to a good bit of  Belphegore's new album, which is amazing. Also Paracletus by Deathspell Omega. There is a very entrancing guitar sound/riff on that album that becomes almost a theme on the album. You can hear it very well at this point in Wings Of Predation.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEmWpbciu9A#t=167\u000a

sVNile - The Burning Pits of the Duat
p3415
(lp3416
VI fucking love this track. Quote from Karl Sanders:\u000a\u000a"The Burning Pits of the Duat" features further collaboration with Dallas. I worked on the lyrics and Dallas set the to music. Dallas really felt that the lyrics and title unquestionably called for utter underworld socery - riffs so fast, chopping and iniquitous as to muscally capture the sensation of being consumed in pits of fire.\u000a\u000aSo Dallas went to work, and the infernal riffing he conjured was so overwhelming in its brutality and hellish in its technicality that for the rest of us to play the material correctly required weeks of intense rehearsal; not only to play the riffs clean and in time (and to legitimately nail the tricky changes), but for the drums to maintain the overwhelming 256 BPM blasting, constant quick beat changing and crazy fills.\u000a\u000aThis was the impossible song at Nile rehearsals - not only challenging but excruciatingly painful. I would return home every night with my wrist in so much pain that I begun to wonder if the song would end my career. After weeks of work, when we finally got the song rehearsed to the point of being able to consistently nail it, I breathed a thankful sigh of relief. I was reminded of the time when John McEntree (Incantation guitarist) toured with Immolation, and spent the whole tour with his wrists in agony, wearing wrist braces, because he was unaccustomed to the strain of using completely differing groups of wrist muscles neded to play Bob Vigny's unusual riffing style. Dallas had "Vigny'ized" me. The song is undeniably deliciously malevolent, yet fun to play, even if it fucking hurts like a bitch."
p3417
aVDude, awesome back story!
p3418
aVRight? I love that back story because it illustrates how much time, effort, dedication, and musicianship goes into creating the most brutal shit in existence.\u000a\u000aSomething about pushing your body to its limits just so you can nail that riff is amazing to me.
p3419
aVIt's such an awesome song and I don't think people realize just *how fast* it actually is. The double picking on that main riff is absolute hell too, one of the few Nile songs I really wanted to learn on guitar and just gave up on. I drummed for a tech death band for a while too and like to think I'm relatively proficient but that damn split- kick blast is impossible. IMPOSSIBLE.
p3420
asVHannes Grossmann - The Radial Covenant
p3421
(lp3422
VThis is awesome but also pretty similar to Obscura, maybe too much... Obscura is one of my favorite band so I enjoyed this release but that could totally be their new album. The compositions are good, but I expected something different from him.
p3423
aVhe did write some of the songs on Cosmogenesis.  The one after that they started collaborating as a unit more.  You can't blame a guy for writing the way he writes. :)
p3424
aVI know he composed for Obscura, but I was wondering why he didn't write these songs for a new Obscura release instead of making a solo project which is really similar...\u000aAnyway, this is just my opinion, and his music is still awesome ;)
p3425
aVI read in an interview that they deliberately approached the composition of Omnivium's songs collaboratively rather than individual members submitting finished compositions.  Grossmann said that these were his individual compositions, some of which were originally intended for Obscura prior to the decision to write as group effort.  But yeah....you are *totally* right on the similarity.  Might as well be an unofficial album.
p3426
aVOk, thanks for the precision, that explains why it sounds so similar :)

p3462
aVignore Drizzt i think he just like's to complain, not like he has put anything here in over a year anyway
p3463
aV'Cause I haven't found anything worth posting. This is where I go to discover new tech-death bands, and I'm not going to karma whore with a Necrophagist vid or some bullshit.\u000a\u000aBut I've actively commented on this sub since there was ~200 subscribers, and I can tell you that when we hit 1000 deathcore actually became a problem here. So much so that tickdickler changed the sidebar. But he doesn't actively mod this place (and I sure as hell don't want to) so instead I ridicule. It rustles my jimmies, in a good way.\u000a\u000aNinjaedit: Oh, you're part of the problem. Please relocate yourself to /r/deathcore.
p3464
aVPretty sure the song we're commenting on never tops 160 bpm and most of that is half-timed chugging. A jazzy interlude and some fancy guitar work does not technical death metal make.\u000a\u000aBut w/e, I'll agree that they're borderline, like the Faceless, or Sons of Aurelius, and I actually like the latter of those two and would probably upvote that so who am I to downvote this? More ridiculous than labeling them deathcore is calling them underrated, however. I'll stand by my ridicule of that statement--this sub loves it some Fallujah.
p3465
aVNot going over 160 bpm and half-timed chugging does not make it deathcore, either. I would say those characteristics are more prevalent in conventional death metal than deathcore. What makes Fallujah rise above the rest is that what makes them technical isn't the death metal parts so much as the ambient and melodic passages. Developing an atmosphere around intricate guitar work, then counter-balancing with progressive death metal riffing really stand out over most new death metal bands.
p3466
aV&gt;half-timed chugging does not make it deathcore\u000a\u000awat
p3467
aVDeath metal has been using half-timed chugging riffs since Cannibal Corpse. Obviously in a much different feel and context than Deathcore bands, which is exactly my point. Nothing from Harvest Wombs or Nomadic would suggest anything but a small core influence. 
p3468
aV&gt; I would say those characteristics are more prevalent in conventional death metal than deathcore.\u000a\u000awat
p3469
aVThis discussion has gotten far too intelligent for me to respond. I can see you know your stuff!
p3470
aVOpinions on their musical merit aside, while they may not be techdeath theyre certainly not deathcore. No breakdowns, no core elements, no deathcore. Maybe im wrong, idk. But even to the uninitiated this doesnt sound like deathcore at all.
p3471
aVSometimes people just want to be contrary for the sake of being contrary. I'll never understand why people feel the need to argue about genre classification, haha. If the good denizens of /r/technicaldeathmetal don't think it's technical death metal, then they're going to downvote it. That's that.
p3472
aVYeah, I don't like to argue genres either but this just seems so cut and dry obviously not deathcore that i felt the need to chime in. No disrespect to anyone
p3473
aVThat shit drives me nuts ! 
p3474
aVI don't listen to deathcore at all. This song is very tech deathy...
p3475
aVPractically the whole song's a breakdown, minus that jazzy bridge. ~~Granted there's no straight-open chugging, but that's deathcore.~~ Chugging at 2:00.\u000a\u000aTo settle things, [the archives](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Fallujah/3540255104) call their earlier and later stuff deathcore.

VBeyond Creation has come to be one of my favorite Tech Death bands, incredible first album
p3523
aVWhen I first listened to their album I was genuinely surprised. I just wish more tech death bands focused on melody rather than seeing how technical they can get.
p3524
aVOh definitely. When tech death bands try to be too technical it cuts out the "flow" of the song, and it becomes choppy and synthetic. Beyond Creation found that perfect balance, with the fucking incredible guitar parts, fret-less bass melodies, drums and vocals. Each song has its distinctive melodies which are just incredible. Some of the riffs or melodies actually became really catchy and memorable, which I would say is rare for tech death, they usually get jumbled up and lost in the technicality of the song. I find myself able to lip-scream(?), air drum and air guitar with Beyond Creation songs

p3575
aVThey have only had one death core EP. Genesis, their first full length, is straight death metal. Ruination is more technical. Gloom EP is more technical still. Demonocracy is more technical and progressive. This follows their progression. The addition of the Cephalic Carnage bassist on the Gloom EP and Demonocracy is what sticks out most to me.

aVI always felt that Ruination went back to -core slightly, not sure why, still like the album though.

(lp3640
VI unsubbed from /r/Metal because it seemed the only bands that were appreciated there were the bands everyone already knew about and liked. An extremely stagnant subreddit. I stay subbed here because sometimes someone posts a legitimately interesting band. But I have to admit, I sometimes question why some people post the bands they do here. There are a lot of posts that are just not technical deathmetal. I'm not meaning to whine, and certainly not trying to declare certain bands as not "real" as others, but it is a little frustrating. I want new tech death. Give me the next Necrophagist (as they're surely not going to fill their own shoes anymore) or Anata!
p3641
aVAgreed, I have tried to post bands on here that haven't been posted before but it seems a lot of posts are bands everybody already knows for karma. 
p3642
aVIt is sad that almost every reply you got on here was people being douches. The internet wins again. 
p3643
aVIt's a small majority, some people will complain and it's fair for them to even if it's about something positive. 
p3644
aV\u005cm/
p3645
aVYeah, let's just post a bunch of deathcore and talk about how tech it is! Make this place the new /r/progmetal. Then we can jerk each other off for being so 'tolerant' and 'openminded' in threads like these.\u000a\u000aIt continuously baffles me why people get so butthurt when bands are pointed out to not be metal. Usually these are the same people that deride notions of genres at all. If it's 'just a label', why do you care so much?
p3646
aVI can say that Progmetal is probably the coolest subreddit for metal in general.\u000a\u000a^^^^^^^^^/circlejerk
p3647
aV/r/progmetal is almost entirely made up of stealth metalcore acts, and people who whine when someone says that they can't stand the metalcore elements.  Sure, prog metal is about pushing genre boundaries, but I still find metalcore annoying as hell.
p3648
aVMetalcore is annoying. But the folks in /r/progmetal think the same thing.\u000aThere are probably 5-10% metalcore bands in progmetal and even if they are metalcore, they are progressive in some sense. And I can guarantee, none of them are stealth metalcore acts. The ones that are metalcore know that they are metalcore .
p3649
aVMainly because it's kind of hard see how deathcore *isn't* metal regardless of how bad it may be.
p3650
aVI'm an uber elitist.  I whine about what bands are real. Deathcore gets posted everyday, and you all just let it happen.\u000a\u000aSo what now, huh? :)
p3651
aVThen you're the small minority, and you can complain all you want over in /r/Metal!

That acoustic-style riff played over and over half way through?  I mean that is just not good songwriting to me and I wonder what others think.
p3871
aVOn Pillars of Perversion it seemed the sound/recording process was a bit DIY approach, but maybe this new song and album, might have been a bit more done in a  studio with editing and layering, maybe, i feel like i might be very wrong though
p3872
aVI definitely see what you're saying where Phantom Love seems more professionally produced.  That can be a good thing and I definitely think it's good that they got a real drummer now.  That said, I just think the songwriting and their style of music have changed for the worse.

aV*Niiiiiice.*  It's similar in a lot of ways to *The Destroyers of All*, but it doesn't just feel like it could be "just another Ulcerate song" like many of the tracks on that album - the riffing feels more distinctive and intricate, like they were really trying to bring the styles of *TDoA* and *Everything is Fire* together.  That can only be a good thing for me, since my main issue with *TDoA* is that it lacks distinctive tracks (compounded by, and followed by, the rarely changing tempo), whereas every song on *EiF* had its own unique structure, use of scales (when not playing in full-on chromatic mode, anyway), signature riffs, etc.\u000a\u000aSo yeah, I'm fucking excited.

p4088
aV6 string currently, but im more into playing Mastodon and just listening to tech death anyways
p4089
aVI agree that this is more of just a fan sub, but I am a musician who tries to play tech death. Currently playing 6 and 7 string guitars. I generally favor 6 string in general, as the extra string(s) on 7+ string guitars kinda force you to slow down(due to how easy it is for the lower tones to lose distinction when played rapidly), and the lower tones generally invoke a very 'core' feel to them, which I dislike. I usually tune in range of dropped C, D standard, and dropped D. I seem to favor dropped tunings for the ease of big chord usage, allowing more complex voicings.
p4090
aVLike everyone else has said: this is a place for posting music and discussion, mostly, and not a place for musicians. You might want to make a post in /r/metalguitar or /r/metalmusicians asking about tech-death players.\u000a\u000aI do play the guitar, but unfortunately, I'm not good enough to play tech death yet. I can barely keep up with Amon Amarth's "War of the Gods" (what I'm learning right now), let alone play along to my favorite tech death bands.\u000a\u000aAs per my guitar: I play a six string, and don't own or play the bass.
p4091
aVI mostly play 6 string. In my DM band, we use 6 strings and tune to drop C. I used to play a baritone for this, but it got smashed on New Years. Long story. \u000aI also have a 7 string that I've done a bit of writing on, but I prefer a smaller neck. On the other hand, soloing is better on the 7 because there's more options and everything is laid out nicer. Can't win. Here's my band.

VGreat production quality; I like the song as well.\u000a\u000aI don't really consider it TDM though.  It reminds me a lot more of Born of Osiris than of The Faceless.  Let me reiterate that I enjoyed this, but the scarcity of leads, relatively common chords and triads, and conventional song structure combined with the breakdowns, general tone, and use of melody make this a (good) deathcore song with some prog and technical elements.\u000a\u000aJust my opinion of course, it is a blurry line.

aVUhhhh... I really like that the symphonic elements have been turned down a little, volume wise. I was afraid it was going to be too loud to hear the nuances but this sounds real good.
p4209
aVThe production on this is top notch. I also like the addition of the female vocals. The bassists vocal efforts on previous albums always felt like they came up just a tiny bit short. Can't wait for some good live videos to emerge on YouTube of the old songs with female vocals added

aVI was a little worried when I heard Elegy - it sounded way too busy. I had higher hopes when I heard Minotaur. After the first listen through the whole thing I have to say I'm quite impressed, but like all albums to really criticize it I need to listen to it a few times.

VI still prefer Elements by a pretty large margin. Great group though. I honestly pity everyone who hasn't listened to all of their stuff. They helped change what I considered good metal. Opened up a whole new world to me. Unfortunately, like most metal/tech/death, the vocals just get to me. Probably why I rank Traced In Air (Cynic, drr) so high now because it demonstrates everything awesome about tech-death. It has excellent musicianship/composition and palatable vocals. 
p4242
aVElements is fucking awesome as well, but Unquestionable and Elements are totally different styles. I don't feel like it's really a fair comparison because of how different they are. Regardless, both those albums have always been and probably always will be two of my metal favorites.

aVI would argue that their first album was.  However I feel that Planetary Duality is a far cry from Deathcore.  That's just my personal opinion though.
p4274
aVI was listening to this album earlier and would say it's definitely closer to Necrophagist than Cephalic.
p4275
aVPlanetary Duality isn't deathcore. I don't even understand how you could think that.
p4276
aVI liked it, but the guitars sounded breakdown-y, and the vocals sounded very core IMO. Again, I enjoyed it quite a bit, its odd how metalcore seems to be synonymous with "bad" on shreddit.

aVCmon dude. Like a 40 second part on one song that sounds BARELY core-ish is enough to bother you that this entire album is on the sidebar?
p4287
aVIn general I just find the Faceless core-ey. A great band regardless.
p4288
aVI consider Planetary Duality as techdeath with core influence. But that's really only with the breakdown-ish riffs, which are far from typical deathcore breakdowns. Otherwise, it's a very unique techdeath album.
p4289
aVLolwut?
p4290
aVFair enough.

aVThis definitely took me by surprise; I haven't followed Beyond Creation very closely since I found their first album a couple of years ago. While their previous effort was enjoyable, I didn't latch onto anything in specific, and to be honest, it was a little forgettable. \u000a\u000aI've listened to this album twice now, and I can feel a consistent theme throughout, which is slightly lacking in my other favorite (The Lucid Collective by Archspire). Walking the line between theme with a mesh of songs that don't stand out and an album with great songs that don't fit together is extremely difficult, but they may have pulled it off. This album is very strong and certainly in contention for my favorite album of the year.

aVAllegaeon, they sing mostly about science and similar things. Not such dark lyrics, but these dudes are right, if you really want to get away from dark topics instrumental metal will be your best bet.

aVI'd put Gojira in the progressive death metal camp, but it's still kinda hard to really put a specific subgenre tag on them.\u000a\u000aIn reality, you'd be kinda hard-pressed to find very many techdeath bands with gory lyrics. There's tons of gore/slam death out there that are ONLY focused on the most shocking gory lyrics, and they are very musically extreme, but I don't classify them as techdeath.\u000a\u000aMost of the bands recommended on the sidebar have zero gore-centric lyrics, if any.

aVI'm interested in knowing why you'd rather not listen to gory lyrics.

aVI'm with everyone else here. Technical death metal isn't about the lyrics. It's the music. If you really care about lyrics enough to look them up, use the metallum. Even lighter albums that I know of are moderately dark in content. That's just the atmosphere of the sub genre. Did you check out the sidebar though? The top ten is pretty clean, excluding Necrophagist. The others are dark in nature but there isn't too much gore to be found there.

VThis album was one of the most pleasant surprises for me last year. 
p4429
aVNick Schendzielos was the saving grace for this album. I love every JFAC album but he makes this one really unique.
p4430
aVthat bass tone is amazing.
p4431
aVI didn't know he was on this album until I checked the lineup after giving it a listen. I'm a big Cephalic Carnage fan and I gave this one a try (like I have with all JFAC's previous efforts, but to little avail), and I was practically drooling over that bass tone. By far their best and most unique effort to date, in my opinion.
p4432
aVI've been listening to JFAC since day one. I never really liked any of their early death-supercore stuff but this album really highlights their change in style, they've gotten soooo much better
p4433
aVIts annoying to see people say like "wow what a twist" when talking about JFAC. They havent been deathcore since 2007 and their last 2 albums have been pretty much borderline tech-death. This album seems to perfectly align with what they've been slowly going for, and didn't surprise me when its full on tech-death. Can't wait to hear what they choose to do next.
p4434
aVI know a fair amount of people who have the same opinion as me regarding their previous efforts and kind of have the, "wow, what a twist" reaction when I think about this album. Basically, I thought their other tech-death-ish albums were all kind of watered-down and uninspired. Granted, it's all just a matter of opinion, but I found it difficult for any of their previous material to actually stick after a few listens. This is a "twist" to me in that it was surprising; refreshing. Totally not bashing your opinion on the matter, though. I don't wanna come across that way. 
p4435
aVI agree its a big twist in the sense that it is their best album yet and is really good, but people are constantly saying like "Wow i thought they were deathcore this is a turn for the better!" And I'm just sitting here like come on man they've been either tech death or regular death metal for a long time
p4436

aVHave been since after their first album really. Their only properly deathcore stuff was their first EP.

aVThey've been tech death since Ruination (2009), but this album is by far the best tech death they've made imo.

(lp4466
VPatience young grasshoppa 
p4467
aVThat would have been reasonable to say in 2009 as well...
p4468
aVI've made two similar posts, myself.
p4469
aVIf you want it to be anything like previous Necrophagist then listen to their live play of dawn and demise from the new album. If it is ever released, I don't think it will be disappointing. Muhammed is a perfectionist, he knows what the standard is. I truly cannot wait for this album.
p4470
aVas much as it pains me to say this: I would rather wait and have it be perfect than out sooner and be OK
p4471
aVMy concern is that when they finally do release new material it will have been so long that expectations are too high and the new stuff can't meet it. Look at Wintersun for example, first album was awsome, tons of energy and great leads, it felt new and fresh. Fast forward 12 years, the second album was stuck in production hell and by the time it was released most people had forgot they were even a thing and worst yet- It wasn't a great album. The longer a band makes us wait the more we expect. Its unfair but it happens.
p4472
aVThis isn't a universal rule, though. Colored Sands was awesome.
p4473
aVand Surgical Steel!
p4474
aVIn addition we should keep in mind that if Necrophagist releases an album, their style might be totally different since it has been 10 years since the last release. 
p4475
aVomfg what if their new shit is djent
p4476
aVI've talked to Muhammad on many occasions. I seriously doubt that'll ever happen lol.
p4477
aVI feel like it's either going to be one of the best albums of the genre or a huge disappointment. The hype surrounding it for the past years have made it so there can be no in between.
p4478
aVI've gotta disagree in Time not being a great album.
p4479
aVSome people loved it, I just wasn't a fan. Personal preference I suppose.
p4480
aVJust an "fyi", the way I understood it was this: Time I is a group of the more experimental songs he wrote after the self-titled debut.  Time II will be more akin to what fans of the first album want.
p4481
aVI have also heard that was the idea. I will be ecstatic if that is the case.
p4482
aVAmen
p4483
aVAt least the drummer [stated](http://www.metalinjection.net/finally/actual-update-new-necrophagist-album) on his [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/romain.goulon.9/posts/10201958509753588) that Necrophagist is not dead.\u000aBut then again I understand that it is taking far too long. 
p4484
aVIIRC Muhammed said a while ago he was going back to studying which is why I thought it was taking so long in the first place. It doesn't however, explain why there has been no update whatsoever.
p4485
aVWell people are still interested obviously, so there isn't much of a need right? Nobody is owed anything. 
p4486
aVAs someone who supports them by purchasing merchandise and buying albums, I'd like an update. If I was just going to download the album and only listen to the music, then I agree, I am not owed anything.
p4487
aVBuying merch does not make you a VIP..
p4488
aVBeing treated like a VIP and posting a quick update on a website are 2 completely different things genius.
p4489
aVI know it seems like its not going to happen, but it took Gorguts 12 years from their last album to release Colored Sands. "So you're telling me there's a chance?". Maybe, just maybe.
p4490
aVI don't give a fuck honestly.  \u000aWhen people hear tech-death, they often rant about how it only shows off technicality and skill. Necrophagist are a perfect example for this in my opinion.  \u000aThey may be the spearhead in technicality, but they lack a lot of substance for me.  \u000aI love Spawn of Possession, Beyond Creation, Gorguts, Soreption, The Faceless, Archspire, Artifial Brain and whatnot, because they are all entirely different, have all some progressive elements, they all have their completely individual appeal, whether it's cool lyrics, amazing grooves, crazy concepts, brainmelting riffs and solos or beautiful melodies.\u000a\u000aBut with Necrophagist, what it comes down to, is pure technicality imo.  I'm not saying I won't be incredibly stoked if they put out another release. How could I not be?  \u000aBut honestly, i don't care much

p4501
(lp4502
VWhat part of New Jersey?
p4503
aVCentral New Jersey
p4504
aVI too am from Central Jersey, and I play a variety of styles. I agree that this area is sorely lacking in a metal scene.
p4505
aVI know a few really good promoters, and some good metal bands that consistently play venues like Harpers, Champs, and Dingbatz. My style lies somewhere between Melodic Death Metal, Tech Death, Black Metal, and Progressive Metal/Progressive Rock. I just try to stay as diverse as I can. Are you in a band?
p4506
aVSame here, but I still feel like there is a dearth in metal bands, especially in the New Brunswick area. I like to play stuff like Gojira, Mastodon, and Behemoth, and I often jam on styles much like the ones you do. I would be really interested in combining the kinds of things that we like into a larger entity. I am not currently in a band.
p4507
aVI would definitely be really interested in jamming, if you're down for it? I know of a couple drummers and a bassist at the moment who are good and always down to jam when they can free up time, both of whom have similar interests of the bands you just named. I always like to start getting used to each other's styles of playing, and then take it from there.
p4508
aVI would absolutely be interested in jamming! I just listened to an album recently that embodies a lot of the elements that I incorporate into my writing and playing styles. Please check it out if you'd like:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.metalsucks.net/2014/12/10/ex-decapitated-drummer-krimh-just-released-a-new-album-stream-it-here/
p4509
aVNice! Hell yea man, I'll check out the album when I get home. New Brunswick isn't too far of a distance from where I live. Sounds like a plan to me! 
p4510
aVAwesome! Inbox me and we can exchange Facebook/contact information. I get off for winter break from university soon, and I have a lot of time to jam and write music.
p4511
aVAlright sweet sounds like a plan. 
p4512
aVI also know a bassist who is superb and is also interested in the same collection of styles.
p4513
aVSorry to hear, techbro.  I can't help you there, I'm in Hawaii, lol.  I feel you on the lack of metal scene...
p4514
aVI'm in south jersey, I play guitar. no amp though.
p4515
aVDo you have a practice amp? How long have you been playing, what styles? Do you have any videos 
p4516
aVMy brother might have one I can borrow.. I have a PodXT I use to record. Been playing about 14 years on and off. Mostly  tech death and death metal. These videos are about 4 years old and they're pretty sloppy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da_jpHZj-ms
p4517
aVNice that's what's up. I actually covered The Faceless Ancient Covenant not that long ago. Yea I mean at the moment I'm pretty much looking for people to jam with, but will dedicate to a band if I see potential.
p4518
aVMy cover is also a bit sloppy, but here's my Ancient Covenant cover. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RyPo2XsS904. I don't have a good guitar processor at the moment, but I'm saving for a good recording program which will suffice. I covered that song literally right before my tubes died and had to take my Peavey 6505+ into Get re-tubed and re-biased.
p4519
aVWhat part of NJ? I see a bunch of death metal shows, with a decent amount of tech death.  
p4520
aVCentral New Jersey. I know South Jersey has a good brutal death metal scene. My style lies between Melodic Death Metal, Tech Death, Black Metal, and a slew of Progressive elements and influences.
p4521
aVIf I may ask. I have seen a lot of similar posts along the lines: "I am a metal musician living in a state in America". This gives one from overseas the impression that there are not a lot of metal musicians in some states in the U.S\u000a\u000aIs it because there are not a lot of metal musicians on those states? Or is it because it is less 'condensed' due to the sheer size of some states?\u000aI am just curious as someone currently residing in a tiny European country. 
p4522
aVI think a lot of it partially comes from the fact that some counties, particularly the one I live in, don't partucularly have a lot Of musicians who play Metal. The metal I particularly play, would be easier to find members from somewhere such as, the Scandinavian regions. Here in the US, there is an overabundance of Metalcore; Atleast in my county, and there are hardly anyone, literally anyone, who is willing to play existing styles such as: Melodic Death Metal, Folk Metal, Black Metal, Technical Death Metal, etc. 
p4523
aVThat, and there really isn't a scene where I live, aside from an overabundance of crappy metalcore bands. I'm not trying to sound elitist, but almost every band I heard that consists of that style from here are usually pretty bad. There was one particularly talented band that came from here that actually did something with their careers.
p4524
aVI'm from queens, I'll play bass in central jersey.
p4525
aVWhen could you free up time to jam? I'm pretty much free after December.
p4526
aVI have a weird schedule. After January 12th I'm on a fairly normal day shift for a while though. I have a vocalist from jersey who'd be interested as well, if anything promising starts coming of this
p4527
aVThat's sick man. I also know of a couple really good drummers. 
p4528
aVWe'll see how everything goes. I have a pretty good amount of material waiting to be tweaked. I'm basing everything off of jamming and then if everyone is on a similar page, and has the potential and chemistry to do this, I'd be down to dedicate to a band. 
p4529

p4705
aVHave you heard their [ep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhY8-iJnZ-M)?  You might like it better after hearing that.  Basically, these guys are taking everything from tech death and making it into something completely different.  At least that is the way I look at it.
p4706
aVI'm halfway through their ep, its alright, very very talented, but when it comes to this type of metal, for me, when a dude is trying to sing, its an automatic turn off for me, there is also a certain drum beat that I despise that they use often. To each his own I guess.
p4707
aVYea I get that.  Luckily they are one of the few bands that I look forward to the clean singing in.
p4708
aVI dunno either, man. It's deathcore mixed with Opeth, and their live show sucks, but everyone here and on /r/metal is jizzing themselves over it...

p4729
aVMaybe I'm alone. This sounds like it could have been another track on "The Aura", which is still totally fucking awesome because that album was incredible, but I really like when I can discern song styles from one album to another. I'm still fucking stoked as hell, and going to buy the album for sure, but just saying.
p4730
aVAgreed. It's a great track, but I actually thought it was a remixed track off Aura at first. Anyway, it's only one song and I know when my band was writing, the first couple songs we wrote for a new album sounded more like the previous album.\u000a\u000aReally looking forward to this still though.
p4731
aVIf you listen to the live recordings of "Earthborn Evolution" it's slower and more melodic than anything on The Aura.
p4732
aVMy sentiment exactly. The mixing and style seems almost identical, but it's also very likely that they would tease a track that's similar to their old ones just let their fans know that they can still still deliver.

aVCan't wait, thanks for the heads up. Got my preorder after hearing the two tracks they put up.. outstanding stuff. Sounds like it will definitely top All Shall Align.\u000a\u000aSeems like they are following a similar path to Arkaik, if anyone digs them. Their first album was pretty much straight-forward brutality (Reflections Within Dissonance) and then really stepped it up with their Sophomore album in terms of songwriting and production (Metamorphignition). I guess you could say the same about Decrepit Birth too.. hope those dudes follow in their legendary footsteps.

p4774
(lp4775
VSilly? Absolutely not, there is a difference between death metal and technical death metal. The reason this subreddit exists is because of the people who are more into the technical aspect don't want to be bothered by scrolling through numerous submissions of bland 'cookie cutter' music to find the bands that are unique and progressing the genre to a new level. I for one, don't subscribe to /r/deathmetal, because I find this subreddit to be more along the lines of what I am in to and I am sure I'm not the only one. Shout out to /u/tickdickler for creating this subreddit as well. \u005cm/ 
p4776
aVWhy thank you. 
p4777
aVYou bet, thanks for creating this awesome community.
p4778
aVNo. I just perused a few things on the front page of /r/DeathMetal and I found several that were pretty non-technical and boring.\u000a\u000aObviously there is some overlap, and there is plenty of technical stuff on /r/DeathMetal, but I like the more specific focus here.
p4779
aVFair enough. I'm more into the techy stuff myself. I just get kind of annoyed when people go crazy with all the sub-sub genres.

VThis is fucking sick. This is honestly a prime example of how I like my tech-death, from vocal stylings to mixing/mastering.\u000a\u000aI really hate when tech death is so over-produced that the finished product makes the guitars sound almost synthy, like the sounds were programmed for a video game or something.\u000a\u000aAnd the drums in this track! They sound like fucking drums! So many modern tech death albums mix the drums to sound like mouse clicks or something. \u000a\u000aIt doesn't sound like robots made it, I guess is what I'm trying to say. I may even venture so far as to call this melodic tech-death. \u000a\u000a
p4794
aVsame feeling man!
p4795
aVI think this album is definitely going to be a "guitarist's" album. Just from the way the guitars are mixed, both in tone and volume, and the fact there are what sounds like 5 guitar tracks in some parts, and that noodly fuckin solo-intermission thing. I'm so stoked. \u000a\u000aMaybe I'm biased because I play guitar, but I also love how the vocals aren't forced on the listener, if that makes sense. A lot of engineers will beef up the vocals such that you can't help but notice them, but it's nice and subtle here. Fuckin bueno.

p4860
(lp4861
VJust curious what you guys think about this topic.  I find too many tech death albums suffer from over compression and would love some recommendations of more "real" sounding music in this genre.  Personally, I loved many aspects of this album; the technical prowess of the band, the driving riffs and layers upon layers of experimentation... but I feel it sounds too muddy when listened to with a good set of speakers and the instrumentation sounds almost blended together and lost within post production.  I first listened to the mp3/web releases and thought I would hold off for a good lossless flac, only to be disappointed that the flac sounded no better than the mp3/web release.  Where can I find truly *good* *sounding* technical death metal?
p4862
aVDo you like Obscura?\u000a\u000aEdit: I though the album was OK, definitely liked their first two releases more though.. I think the guy in the video nailed it.
p4863
aVYes, I really like Obscura... but their sound suffers in much the same way.  Although it is not half as noticeable as the Fallujah records, Obscura really could sound better (check my earlier response to u/goldenvile).   I'm just sad that such an awesome band (Fallujah) had their hard work ruined by shoddy production and hope there will be a re-release of this that is more listenable.
p4864
aVHmm I think they sound really nice. Do you have any examples of music that sounds like what you're looking for? (metal or not)
p4865
aVSure... please check this video for a more detailed overview of what I am talking about here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qz7ZjJS9U8\u000a\u000aExamples of good production in this genera (mostly nothing modern that I can find) - \u000a\u000aNecrophagist / Epitaph\u000a\u000aDeath / Human (pretty much everything prior to The Sound of Perseverance\u000a \u000a/u/meshugganner pointed out Gorguts... I'm finding this is a good answer to my original query.   Production seems spot on and I'm going to have to revisit their catalog.  Thanks!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p4866
aVYou think Necrophagist sounds *less* compressed than Obscura? 
p4867
aVAbsolutely... but don't take it from me.  [Check the waveforms yourself.](https://imgur.com/WaDvjjd) Maybe you don't really notice because everything these days is so compressed and washed out.  Get a truly good set of speakers (not Beats by Dre ;) and take a listen to some of the examples posted here.  It's about the sound quality of the instruments coming through... not the songs themselves.   I really do love this music, but now that I have a good system at home I really get to hear how much of the production is soured by the 'loudness war'. 
p4868
aVI've been thinking about getting some Audio Technicas for a while now..
p4869
aVThose are really good... this [comparative review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et_PWifUd1w) was pretty funny.  I'm a big Klipsch fan myself.  Their desktop speaker offerings suffered from some over-heating problems and so they were discontinued (all but the 2.1 system)... but the sound was hands down the best available.  So when my old 4.1's died (after over a decade of use) I searched around and finally found a set of Klipsch 5.1 Ultras on eBay and decided to risk it... even if they are 'used', for $200 I am one incredibly happy listener.
p4870
aVI agree with you, but wouldn't say it's not "good sounding" as the writing and technical ability is amazing. I think what you're looking for is "well produced". \u000a\u000aI'm a big fan of the production on the new Black Crown Initiate. One of the few tech death albums I've heard recently with a great bass tone as well. 
p4871
aVAbsolutely correct, I should have said "well produced".  I love this style of music but think in general that the production is lacking on most records here and Fallujah's production is a perfect example to illustrate what I mean.  If you check the dynamic range of this album, it is around 2-3 for most tracks!  The new Beyond Creation album is around 5-6... noticeably better sounding but go back a few years and listen to Necrophagist where the Dynamic Range stays right around the 8 mark and you should be able to hear how the production sounds better on this 10 year old album than most of what is released today.   Now take that and compare to a different style of music like the latest Daft Punk album which at the lowest is 9 and up to 13-15(!) on average and you can literally feel difference in clarity of the instruments on the record.  My stereo has a volume knob... I don't need the producer to drown out all the feeling just so the music seems louder than other bands. \u000a\u000aThank you for the recommendation!  I haven't listened to Black Crown Initiate yet... will be sure to check them out.   Any idea where I can get a lossless copy?  Seems the CD bundle is sold out and the new album isn't on their bandcamp site. \u000a\u000a 
p4872
aVHow do you feel about ulcerate?
p4873
aVDon't get me started on Vermis. It sounds terrible on vinyl.\u000a\u000aI wish I just bought the CD. Luckily, it came with a digital download.
p4874
aVI think Beyond Creation might be better for you. Also Ulcerate, as someone else said. \u000a\u000aBoth much more dynamic. 
p4875
aVDespite everything I've said here... I want to be clear, Beyond Creation is one of my favorite bands right now.  I really do love this music! However... I know the music would have more punch if it weren't produced for "normal" people to listen to on their iPods.
p4876
aVI 100% agree. Most of the new tech bands, or really metal in general, I find it hard to get into because it just SOUNDS flat or lifeless. Even though I know how complex or talented the band is. The sound just kills it. 
p4877
aVObscura by Gorguts. Not the other Obscura.
p4878
aVThank you for pointing this out!  So far, I think this is my favorite response (also looking forward to checking out BCI).  I actually have Colored Sands but didn't think about it last night when I created this post.  This album isn't half as brick-walled as other albums... sound is great, The Battle of Chamdo was totally unexpected, and just listen to the clarity and punch in those drums!  Looking up their older stuff and giving them a second listen :)\u000a\u000aEDIT: Well... maybe I need to find this on vinyl?  I checked out the Gorguts-Obscura album and the [CD release is pretty bad](http://dr.loudness-war.info/album/list?artist=gorguts).  Check out the [waveform of the second track](https://i.imgur.com/6VXxlHg.png)  (all tracks are similar) and look at all the red lined sections.  It's as if it was cranked to the max on the CD release.  Their latest album thankfully does not seem to suffer from this.\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: typical... show valid proof to back up my claims in a serious discussion and get down voted for it with no comment as to why.  Seems someone is too cowardly to respond, but is OK with trying to suppress anything they don't agree with.

That's very strange. That doesn't make sense to me. I have the actual cd, and I've always needed to turn the volume *up* when I put it in compared to other stuff I listen to. Bad rip maybe?\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: You're probably, maybe (?),  right about this. Trust me, bad production (as in just bad, or as in *too* good) bugs the hell out of me. If there is clipping, etc. in Obscura, I swear it only adds to the disgusting, ugly, putrid sound that that record is trying to convey. I don't know - I just love that god damned album.

aVYeah I was on the RoS hate-train for a while, but honestly the writing on the last album really won me over. I don't really care if they can play it live or not, I like the music for what it is.

aVMann is still an arrogant prick who can't play the new material live unfortunately.

p4960
aV[deleted]
p4961
aVThat's because Keene is a control freak and thinks way to high of himself. Seeing them live and watching him treat techs like shit because his rig was fucking up was extremely disheartening.
p4962
aVI've seen them twice in Seattle and both times he had issues with his rig. What's up with that? You'd think they would have figured out the problem by now.

aVIt's just so far from their early material. Much less original, imo. I can still enjoy some of their newer songs. There are some great grooves, mean poly-drums and haunting guitar riffs, but they're just... Not as good as they used to be.

p4981
aVI listened to it a few times and thought it was pretty good, with some stand-out tracks like Two Pound Torch, but recently I've gone back and listened again and it's even better than I thought. It's very dense, drums are insanely creative and the songwriting is very good. There is no filler here, it's a really solid modern DM album, powerful enough to make me forget about TUK. Hell, even Gauchy improved a LOT\u000a\u000aEdit : My only concern is the snare sound, it's far too conventional and flat to be a cryptopsy snare, it needs to have the trash can sound! :P
p4982

p5014
aVIt might be a stretch but the new animals as leaders album has a lot of slapping and even though there isn't a bassist it's really melodic and basscentric. 
p5015
aVNot very deathy but, "spacey, melodic" and "lots of bass" makes me think of proggy bands like [Exivious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWyEY4oKIOs), and maybe [CHON](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEsdAIQwphE)...maybe not CHON really, I just like the band too much not to share it. \u000a\u000aEdit: maybe [Arkaik](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTtmh_BmELY&amp;feature=kp) too? The chorus is melodic at least.
p5016
aVNot sure how melodic you'd consider them, but [Hideous Divinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNxBa0jou28) is some pretty good and bassy stuff from Italy.
p5017

aVSpacey &amp; melodic makes me think Dissonance in Design, though I don't know that they're all that heavy on the bass.

p5134
aV[deleted]
p5135
aVI apologize for being such a prick about it, I was really drunk last night.\u000a\u000aTo me, Fleshgod was a wonderful band because they basically played classical music in techdeath form. Any song you listen to on Oracles, you'll hear the same cadences/trills/progressions that you would on Agony, except in the case of Oracles, *there is no symphony*. It's all done with the instruments of the band. I have never heard another album as classical in nature yet so pure fucking techdeath as Oracles.\u000a\u000aWith Agony, this all goes out the window. They stop playing death metal in the style of classical music. They play some generic riffs that you can't even hear, mindless blast beats that syncopate at the same place in half the songs, and all of this is being drowned out by the awful symphonic elements. It's about as unoriginal as it gets. The album wouldn't change if you just took out the guitar and bass altogether. They no longer play classical music in death metal form, they play shitty death metal smothered in copy and pasted orchestral sequences. Fuck that.\u000a\u000aLast, it's no longer techdeath! Listen to At the Guillotine, or In Honor of Reason, then listen to The Egoism... The fuck? This album seems to be the same. They try so goddamn hard to sound epic, but it just ends up being extremely boring. It doesn't sound so bad at first, but then you realize that the rest of the song is the exact same, and the rest of the album will be that way as well... 
p5136
aVI hear where you're coming from since Agony and Oracles are completely different beasts and I far prefer Oracles if I'm to be honest. but to say their newer work is totally unoriginal is a pretty left field response IMO. The only other band that utilizes symphonic elements like this is Septic Flesh (that I can think of off hand) and FG does it with a much greater emphasis on tech. I assume, (although never researched to be certain) that they compose all the symphonic parts in their songs so it's not simply some cut and paste nonsense.   \u000a  \u000aI'd like to see a heavier influence on the guitars playing melodies again and like you said, it's hard to pick out exactly what the guitars are playing because they now seem to simply augment the melody with rhythm instead of conduct it. I also agree with you that they're sacrificing the heavy tech they used to brandish and now strive for 'epicness' or whatever.   \u000a   \u000aStill, I have high hopes for Labyrinth. It's natural for a band's sound to evolve, it's just too bad when our expectations don't coincide.  \u000a\u000aEDIT: after listening to the track a few more times I like it more than I did. There are guitar parts throughout the song that drill 32 notes into your face, drilling rhythmic intensity (very remeniscent of some Septic Flesh tunes). But there are also really fast paced melodic runs that burst almost from nowhere and dissipate just as quickly. Band members said this album would be a culmination of the new and old sound. The symphonic will stay but perhaps some components of Oracles and Mafia will be reasserted stronger than their last effort.    \u000aThose classical yet brutal riffs we crave surface occasionally but are much more reserved and controlled than on Oracles. They bob their head up just long enough for us to notice their presence and then disappear again. I can see based on the praise the band has given the CD along with the tracks I've listened to already, the goal is to create something masterful, novel,  driven by the essence of metal but mixed, now entwined with melodic, symphonic elements.    \u000a   \u000aGod damn it, I hope I love it.    \u000a\u000aTo really judge the quality of riffs in said music I recommend everyone take a few listens.   \u000a   \u000a And better yet, get some descent headphones and an amp to go with them if need be. If you happen to be listening to your tunes through your motherboard audio input then your opinion never really mattered, head to /r/headphones  for a start and head-fi.org to start grasping how much more money you need to spend on audio equipment.     \u000a   \u000aIm rambling,

aVI still have yet to listen to the album without getting chills from "Alone With You". \u000a\u000aThe entire album is fantastic.
p5400
aVThat song is great.
p5401
aVI was delighted that it was on Google Play All Access this morning. Been blaring it all day at my desk. It's goddamn memorizing. Can't wait to see some of this live at the Summer Slaughter next month. 
p5402
aVI don't think I'll make it out to see them at summer slaughter this year :/ I'm fucking pissed haha
p5403
aVThat sucks man. I'm crossing my fingers my work doesn't fly me somewhere that week. 
p5404
aVI am still waiting for my preorder. Not sure when it will arrive but I am dying to hear this album. I heard Sapphire, Carved From Stone, and Levitation so far.
p5405
aVHaha I'm going to order a copy today! Hopefully it gets here fast.
p5406
aVI think IndieMerch is shipping it today, so it's gonna be a while. Just listen now!
p5407
aVNo way, some people in the US have received their preorders but I don't know if they are from IndieMerch (I ordered from them as well). I still have not received my shipping confirmation yet.\u000a\u000aI don't want to listen to it yet....must resist till I get my preorder....

VCan't wait to listen to the album in its entirety...man! these guys are talented!
p5422
aVI listened once to "The Harvest Wombs" and Fallujah was propelled to the top of my list. "The Flesh Prevails" is personally one of the most anticipated albums this year.
p5423
aVWhile Sapphire did grow on me, I like this one a lot more.
p5424
aVHaha, you're fast! Just read the update on their facebook page.  \u000aOh and the song is insane!
p5425
aVLol just happened to be on fb at the exact time it was posted.
p5426
aVjerk
p5427
aVLol you are the one who made me pay attention to Facebook somewhat again.  I hadn't done anything with it for ages before that.
p5428
aVhaha you're welcome. Facebook ain't too bad, especially when bands post new songs. 
p5429
aVYea and it's not like I can rely on axl to post new things.  I posted both allegaeon and fallujah in comments on ms and axl chose to post about Randy blythe's dick instead.  I sometimes wonder why I still look at that site.
p5430
aVW, Negro, me, and all the other commenters. I basically press Play and then hit up the comments.
p5431
aVYea the comments are probably the only reason I visit lol.
p5432
aVCan't get into it. I'm bored and I do not understand all the hype surrounding this.
p5433
aVEveryone's entitled to their opinion, but man I feel bad. These guys have only gotten better with each release. I'm so excited for this to release!
p5434
aVYeah, agreed.  I pre-ordered this, which I've only done a few times.  Fallujah is one of the few bands I've stayed interested in. 
p5435
