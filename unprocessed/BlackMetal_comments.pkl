aVTo me, Black Metal is to Metal what Punk was to Rock and Roll. Its just nothing. Standing for whatever, fuck the world, hail self empowerment and fuck what everyone thinks. I think that, like punk, Black Metal became kind of full of itself. But i do generally think that Black Metal is in a good place these days. To me, I will call something Black Metal as a descriptive faster than I would label a certain group of bands "Black Metal". 
p18
aVI've recognized the punk-like attitude in Black Metal, and although it's only one aspect of BM I still think it's a very important one. A lot of BM bands do stand for "whatever" and the ones that stand upon deep and enriching subject material and don't give a fuck what the mainstream establishment drone-minded zombies think,  are the ones that stand out to me.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately like you said, some BM bands have become full of themselves. Not naming names, but I still listen to them if I like their sound and feeling.
p19
aVExactly. The nature of the beast is that you can be a prick, yet still make some badass music.

aVBlack Metal is beauty and awe-inspiring in sheer chaos and order. It is sheer brilliance that I've never seen in any other music genre or art form. While I myself am not a satanist or fascist, it's interesting to see people speak their mind. 
p22
aVExactly. It is for the same reasons that I love classical music. The only genre that compares to metal in terms of variety.
p23
aVThe sheer brutal, elegant force in the genre compelled me to listen more.
p24
aVBLACK METAL IS NOTHING TO ME BUT HATRED AS A LIFESTYLE\u000a\u000aHAIL SATAN\u000a\u000aWORSHIP DOOM\u000a\u000aFUCK THE UNBELIEVERS

aVIt's a Nexionic art form and a propaganda tool. It is (was?) useful in the creation of a subculture zeitgeist that had the potential to spur certain individuals predisposed to it towards action. Spiritually speaking, or otherwise. As far as music goes objectivity, it's one my favorite genres because it expresses how I feel; even though that's a pretty mundane answer its still important. I feel like I make sense to myself when I listen to it, if that can make any sense. \u000a\u000aEdit: As far as Satanic themes being a necessity to Black Metal, I disagree. Any archetype that that inspires the application of will and potential fits within what I believe BM set out to do. I also accept things that seek to express and reveal parts of the self; hidden or otherwise. But thats because that is helpful to me as a person. However, I think having an overall unified philosophy which focuses on LHP conscious theory/evolution is beneficial. \u000a\u000a
p27
aV&gt; it's one my favorite genres because it expresses how I feel; even though that's a pretty mundane answer its still important\u000a\u000aI don't find it to be a mundane answer at all. Expression is an outward act of feeling. And to feel music is more than just listening to it, especially if it encourages you to express your own feelings.\u000a\u000aI also agree with your statement on Satanic themes. I can take them or leave them either way, as long as the music speaks to me on a deep level. If the musical lyrics and themes contain a form of esoteric knowledge which spurs my inquisitive nature to seek its meaning, then I will be more inclined to listen to it more as I seek out other sources for this knowledge.\u000a\u000aWhile seeking out one's own self I believe it is important to address the dark parts of our duality. If we can shed light on those things within and overcome them, or if they're not conquerable then accepting them, we not only better ourselves and understand ourselves as individuals, but we have a better understanding of human nature and humanity as a whole. 
p28
aVBlack Metal Ist Krieg.\u000aWar, war against the world, against the destruction, fighting with even more destruction, filled with darkness &amp; doom.\u000aOther then that, when I listen to black metal, I feel in a whole different world, feel like I'm transported to a whole different universe...something that no other genre could do.\u000a

Water stands crystalline frozen in time and the pines are\u000astill shivering. I could never tell you why I like this dark crazy music, but when I close my eyes and just listen,\u000ait doesn't even really matter. Maybe that's the point.

aVA representation of the individual who creates it. Death and thrash are a way for musicians to release their anger. The violence and gore is a fantasy. The same goes for Power metal. Black metal is about expressing true feelings and desire. Misanthropy, existentialism, the artists who write these songs truly believe in the message they are trying to convey.

It is credited with creating the modern black metal genre and produced some of the most highly-acclaimed and influential artists in extreme metal.\u000a\u000a&gt;The scene attracted massive media attention when it was revealed that its members had been responsible for two [murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder) and a wave of church burnings in Norway. The scene had an ideology and ethos and was likened to a [cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult), with the core members referring to themselves as "The Black Circle" or "Black Metal Inner Circle". It consisted primarily of young men, many of whom gathered at the record shop Helvete ("Hell") in [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo). In interviews, they voiced extreme [anti-Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Christian_sentiment) and [misanthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy) views, presenting themselves as genuine [Satanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism) who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil. They adopted pseudonyms and appeared in photographs wearing '[corpse paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_paint)' and wielding medieval weaponry. The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those it deemed to be "true" or committed. Musical integrity was highly important and artists wanted black metal to remain [underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_music) and uncorrupted.\u000a\u000a&gt;In August 1993, several of its members were arrested and in May 1994 were convicted variously for arson, murder, assault and possession of explosives. Most showed no remorse for their actions. The Norwegian media covered events closely, but the reporting of the scene was often sensationalist. For example, one Norwegian TV channel interviewed a woman who claimed Satanists had sacrificed her child and killed her dog.  The early Norwegian black metal scene has since been the subject of books and documentaries.\u000a\u000a&gt;====\u000a\u000a&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/NdJ7G1i.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:God_Seed_Hellfest_2009_14.jpg)\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a^Interesting: [^Thorns ^\u005c(band)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorns_\u005c(band\u005c)) ^| [^Old ^Funeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Funeral) ^| [^Burzum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burzum) \u000a\u000a^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+coinf5o) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+coinf5o)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

aVAs I sit here I'm listening to Filosofem and the song "Jesu Dod" is playing. This song is full of raw energy and emotion. The lo-fi recording exemplifies the feeling of coldness, anger, and despair. I have the heat cranked up in my room and I still get goosebumps during this song, even after listening to it hundreds of times. As the album transitions to "Erblicket die Töchter des Firmaments" the pace slows down, the mood gets more despairingly dark and the feeling gets colder.\u000a\u000aTo me this is the heart of Black Metal. Coldness, despair, animosity, misanthropy, anti-religion, anti-establishment. \u000a\u000aSo lo-fi Vs. hi-fi: I honestly prefer lo-fi, but I'm not against hi-fi recordings necessarily either. I just prefer the lo-fi feelings, and the "I did this shit myself for dirt cheap. Fuck your $4K recording equipment" attitude towards bands who believe they've made it big with expensive studio equipment and a large contract.\u000a\u000aSatanic Vs. Non-Satanic lyrics: If the lyrics actually have something meaningful to say other than "Look at me I worship Satan, boogy boogy boo!" Then I don't care either way. As long as the lyrics are deeply personal to the musician and identifiable to me on an emotional, spiritual, or philosophical level, I'll listen to it and likely enjoy it. Even if it's not trve.
p41
aVIt's about the music. The riffs, the screams and anything that goes with it. I think I actually prefer the lyrics not to be about Satan, that stuff has gotten pretty old, but it's not that important. I also prefer good sound quality over poor but usually won't let lo-fi stop me from enjoying good tunes.
p42
aVI've talked about that with some friends of mine who aren't into metal at all and it seems that I listen to Black Metal like they listen to Reggae. It calms me down, help me feel at home, and when people don't like it when it's on, they are very vocal about it.\u000a\u000aNothing is better on a sunday morning than a cup of herbal tea with Burzum, Opera IX or Lustre.
p43
aVlife itself
p44
aVI like the power, the ambiance, the speed, the brutality, the harsh vocals, and the clash of beauty with chaos and violence.  It is a good reminder of the chaotic and strange world we live in.  \u000a\u000aTo be honest, I don't pay too much attention to lyrical content.  If a band is singing against religion, or about natural themes, great.  If they are singing about satanic things (as in, Satan is a person), I'll listen to it out of my disdain for religion and it's ideas for entertainment purposes, but I don't "believe" in "Satan."  \u000a\u000aIf a band is advertising that they are totalitarian/Nazi/Christian, I won't go out of my way to listen to it as it'll probably sour what I think of it.  \u000a\u000aI think Lo-Fi vs Hi-Fi doesn't matter too much, both can be done correctly.  \u000a\u000aI don't see either of the trends you mentioned to be necessary to the music.
p45
aVI feel like an outsider a bit when it comes to being a black metal fan, because all these people are like "hurrdurr it has to be lofi" and other hurrdurr shit. And I'm just over here, not giving a fuck. I listen to whatever black metal sounds good. From Agalloch to Xasthur, I pretty much like it all. I like some Aryan, Satanic, Pagan, Depressive, it really doesn't matter if its hifi or lofi. If it sounds good to me, I like it\u000a
p46
aVBlack metal is much more than just music. 
p47
aVHow so? I know Black Metal usually strives to have some sort of stance against something or a certain ideology - however at it's core it's music. Black Metal should be about enjoying the *sound* of the music, not JUST the ideology. If you listen to Black Metal talk about ideology but not just the music it's probably better to just read a book about it. \u000a\u000aYes, I can understand that Black Metal is one of them genres that resonates with people and can evoke strong feeling. It moves me sometimes but I would say, like any other genre it's just music.
p48
aVwell it really depends on what black metal means to you. Personally, I see black metal as the best vehicle for certain ideals. Ideals which are anti-human, anti-society and anti-weakness. Black metal in that sense is intolerance. Think about how foolish the idea of christian black metal is, for one.
p49
aV&gt;Black metal in that sense is intolerance. Think about how foolish the idea of christian black metal is, for one.\u000a\u000aMaybe if you compare it to what the history was in the 90's with the whole 2nd wave of Norwegian Black Metal. However, I think it certainly does have a place in Black Metal if it isn't preachy. It would be interesting to see a Black Metal band that is Christian that talks about his faith and possibly the negative things surrounding it. \u000a\u000a&gt;well it really depends on what black metal means to you. Personally, I see black metal as the best vehicle for certain ideals. Ideals which are anti-human, anti-society and anti-weakness.\u000a\u000aSure, I agree but Black Metal in my opinion should be a vehicle for a whole plethorda load of different topics. Just because the originators of the scene were focusing on that doesn't mean that it can not evolve. Heck, I love the topics you just described in Black Metal but I also share the same love but Atmospheric Black Metal which is about nature and all that good stuff. To me, diversity is the spice of life and as long as an idea has integrity and is delivered well they could talk about anything they want.
p50
aVI think I would like the idea of atmospheric black metal played about the idea of primitivism and the rejection of society. I see that as an extension of the anti-humanist aspect of black metal. The idea is interesting. Basically if the Unabomber was into BM.
p51
aV&gt;Think about how foolish the idea of christian black metal is, for one.\u000a\u000aMaybe to you based on your idea of black metal...which totally isn't the only one or the most valid (or necessarily valid at all) viewpoint about the genre. 
p52
aVWell you can have your viewpoint on this and it can differ, but I firmly believe that black metal can never be steadfast in its conviction if it were done about "harmony" or any such subjects.
p53
aVYour insistence that black metal has to have a firm conviction in the subjects you think it does is pretty interesting to me, honestly. It's just not consistent that a genre you literally can't know the ideology behind half the time without reading a lyric sheet is bound by those lyrics and the thoughts behind them. \u000a\u000aIt's like I've said to you before- if you're really enjoying a band's sound and then the lyric sheet reveals that their lyrics are predominantly pro-Christian, how does that make them any worst than they were a second ago? Some people would even insist that makes them not black metal- how can that possibly be the case? 
p54
aVWell you can't say you're fully consuming the meaning of it if you're only exposed to part of it. Even if the lyrics were clearly audible, the act of reciting them mentally reinforces that message. The act of viewing the art helps put the viewer in a certain mindframe. The aspects of it aren't chosen by accident. I do not believe in fulling listening or understanding an idea without consciously engaging my mind with all aspects of it, as far as it is possible.   \u000a  \u000aAnd in that unlikely hypothetical situation, I would feel very much revulsed. I'm not sure in what you believe in, but I am proud to say I cannot not feel hate even when I walk past a church or a mosque. Some people would say they are not black metal, yes. But ultimately it depends on how you personally define black metal.
p55
aVMan, I don't even know how to respond to a lot of that. Especially \u000a\u000a&gt;but I am proud to say I cannot not feel hate even when I walk past a church or a mosque. \u000a\u000aI mean, I'm an atheist, but like, wow. I have absolutely no response. 
p56
aVWell if it's any consolation, I've long known that your views differ very greatly but I respect your good taste in music. That we can agree on.
p57
aVty bb. For what it's worth, disagreements about views on the music aside, I feel the same way about you- can't say you've ever talked about a band positively/posted a band that was anything less than pretty damn good, as far as I've seen.
p58
aVI like anything that is directly or idealogically opposed to monotheist filth, and sounds nice to me. Fell in love with BM listening to Gorgoroth's Pentagram back when people still had cassettes. Still listen to Mg\u0142a and Burzum in my car so loud that I offend pretty much everyone I come in contact with. 
p59
aVSo polytheistic dogmas are inherently better or worse?
p60
aVInherently less relevant. The monotheists have spent the last 1000 years meddling and trying to expand their bunk morals and ideals by any means necessary.
p61
aVIn the sense of geopolitics I would have to agree that the abrahamic religions have had more influence and are thus a bigger threat. But I feel that any organised religion is based on the subjugation of one by others. This limits true development of the human to beyond itself and thus I find it objectionable. 
p62
aVorganization and subjugation aren't the same thing. it's the jewchrislam shitbags who made religion wholly focused on subjugation and only subjugation.
p63
aVWell I do understand how the two can be conflated, but I hold that large scale organisation inherently carried cooperation and with that ideological compromise. 
p64
aVIt's mostly about my need to look down on everyone else and say they're not kvlt enough.\u000a\u000aIt's also great music for handjobs.\u000a\u000aEDIT: guys I'm kidding. Put down your spiked armbands, I'm just fucking around.
p65
aVTo me, not so much. Either of these "flavors" has its gems. And I think this is the general consensus on _this_ subreddit. But if you go to /r/TrueBlackMetal that's a different story
p66
aVI wasn't even aware of it's existence. Thanks for posting that. \u000a\u000aI agree; however, in regards to satanic lyrics, it's funny that some of the more influential SWBM (Burzum, Bathory) weren't luciferians. They just sought to be the antithesis of Christianity, so they used the imagery as a form protestantism. In spite of that, some are of the opinion that black metal isn't black metal without satanism. \u000a\u000aHopefully were all here because we like the way it sounds. It is music afterall. 
p67
aVUnspoiled nature.
p68
aVCool music. Nothing more, nothing less- it's just a type of music that I really enjoy. I don't care about the imagery, I don't care about whether an artist is into it for anything more than the riffs- I just care about if it's something enjoyable to me. 
p69
aVYeah, I like your response. Its about the nice music style. I listen to a lot of different kind of music, but black metal is my favorite.\u000a\u000aBlack metal has a nice image, but its not really a path you follow. Its something more personal you don't really want to share. IMO\u000a\u000aToo bad you get downvoted. 
p70
aVIt's not a popular opinion here- which I think is too bad. Whatever. 
p71
aVThis is why we often don't agree about metal.

VSick. Thanks posting this. I'm digging through the rest of their stuff now. It reminds me of how I felt when I was first introduced to metal through avant-garde bands like Age of Silence and Arcturus. 
p204
aVHappy to do it. While I appreciate the diversity within BM -- everything from the most Christ-rapey traditional stuff to progressive sax heavy stuff -- I always find myself gravitating towards bands like Solefald. The Linear Scaffold is amazing, I just posted from Norrøn livskunst when I noticed the startling dearth of the band on Reddit period. \u000a\u000aA personal favorite you may also like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7Z2hxywrk

VThis is the best song on the album.
p212
aVThats not pagan.
p213
aVWhy does this have "pagan" as a flair?
p214
aVDidn't know what to tag it is. I think it's fairly pagan, the band use imagery of nature and old English symbols.
p215
aVWhy not just Atmospheric and be done with it?
p216
aVBut everything is cooler with pagans...
p217
aVIn Germany, some leftist asshats call Winterfylleth NSBM for their lyrics.
p218
aVIt's completely ridiculous to call them NSBM.\u000a\u000aThey might be nationalistic, and I understand there was some controversy about this in the past, which I do not know well enough to comment on, but to call them NSBM is completely illogical as how can a band that champions old English lore, mythology and ideology as NSBM?
p219
aVYeah, I know. But by those people, a band is even considered NSBM or right extremist if e.g. one of the band members has been in a band that was signed by a label supporting mostly those ideologies. \u000a\u000aJust wanted to throw that out there.
p220
aVThank you, it's nice to see someone with a bit of common sense for once discussing this topic. As someone who knows this band I can confirm that they're not even NS out of or in a musical context, in fact they're quite the opposite. 
p221
asVI'm in a one-man black metal project, would love some second opinions on my music
p222
(lp223
VIt's very good work. I think your vocals are mixed a little too loud and a little too rough. Could use a duller, more distant feel.
p224
aVThank you so much for the feedback. I'll certainly spend some time tomorrow tweaking the vocals, see if I can't get a more distant sound. 
p225
aVThis is some real good black metal, please continue delivering. I agree with Astealoth on vocals, it'd be cooler if it was a little bit distant.
p226
aVThanks for the kind words, man. And, yeah, as I told Astealoth, I'll be working on getting that distant sound/feel.
p227
aVSorry for being picky but surely you are a one man black metal project, sounds strange to say you're in a one man band
p228
aVYeah, probably should've thought a bit harder about the title... Oh well.
p229
aVReally looking forward to an EP, pretty damn good stuff.
p230
aVI really liked it, honestly. This type of black metal is right up my alley. I love the lead guitar and the progression. I thought the vocals were vicious, but agree that they were slightly too loud. \u000a\u000aHonestly though, keep working at it, fine tune the sound and I could see myself buying stuff like this. :)
p231
aVThis is incredibly awesome. I think you have major potential of going somewhere with it!
p232
aVJust keep playing man, you'll only get better. That said this is great so far. I'm a fan.
p233
aVI actually quite liked the vocals, but I would agree with comments that they're just slightly louder than they need to be. The guitar parts were top notch, but I did notice in my studio monitor headphones there sounds like there's much more going on my left side than the right, but if you intended it that way then that's totally fine.  Other than a couple mixing issues that be easily fixed this song was honestly pretty badass and I look forward to hearing more of your work.
p234
aVI like it, it's good. 
p235
aVI'm totally digging it. Great playing, and that voice is fucking great. My biggest gripe has already been addressed, so I won't repeat it. Keep it up dude, I'll for sure be keeping an eye out for any future releases.

p250
aVRight on, will do. Also, how did you alter the theme/colors of your page? I created one sub a while back (/r/noisecomps) but haven't gotten too into the technical aspects of everything. 
p251
aVI found a pre-made layout called /r/flatdark and made small changes to the coding. I was tired of my subs looking dull and taught myself some basic css / html.

asVNew Diagnose:Lebensgefahr Material
p259
(lp260
VI'm excited for this but it's getting kind of irritating that all they've been doing is re-releasing Transformalin over and over again for some time. I fucking love Nattramn's work but I'd like to hear some new stuff as well. \u000aI know this vinyl edition has three extra songs but when I mean new stuff I mean a new album, book, band, etc.\u000a\u000aIf you haven't heard his demo of Ödelagt (under the name Trencadis) I recommend it bigtime. I got it off of discogs and it was worth the time I had to wait.
p261
aVYeah, it kinda sucks to see Nattramn stuck on the one project - the user [14words](https://www.flashback.org/u298248) on Flashback apparently has connections with Nattramn, and states that he is slowly working on a new music project [this was from around the time of the release of Grishjarta]. \u000a\u000aI've listened to Ödelagt, and although it's a very masterful ambient work, once again it is just re-released old material. From what I gather his mental state has improved massively, but with this came decreased creativity.
p262
aVI'm happy to hear that he's working on more music. Everything he has done is fantastic and I listen to it very often. I'm also happy that his mental state is much better and I hope that one day he'll do interviews and such. Maybe he could put all the bullshit Silencer rumors to rest.

aVFuck, I don't have the money currently. I guess I'll have to wait for it to end up on discogs.
p266
aVAbsolutely - it's such a shame that all his work is surrounded by rumours and stories trying to make him out as anything other than an extremely gifted musician.\u000a\u000aYes, he has anxiety and has produced some dark work. No, that does not make him a psychotic murderer with pig hooves for hands.

aVI like it a lot - the nearly 30 minute track does not 'feel' like 30 minutes although it is suitably epic and ambient in equal measure. It's streaming at [Avant Garde Music's Bandcamp](https://avantgardemusic.bandcamp.com/music) page.

aVYeah, to me there's nothing quite like VBE's sound, except possibly some early Dodheimsgard records.

p543
aVI'm still awaiting the second I album. The dudes said they were working on the second full-length back in '08! Whatever happened with that is beyond me.\u000a\u000aWith that said, I can't believe Between Two Worlds was released 9 years ago.

p549
aVVreid.
p550
aVKvelertak maybe? They're a cool band nonetheless
p551
aVKvelertak seems to get thrown in the whole "hipster black metal" pile with Wolves in the Throne Room, Liturgy, Krallice, and Deafheaven, but Kvelertak are rad as hell. One of the best live bands I've ever seen.
p552
aVThat is *really* unfortunate if so, because they don't sound even a little bit like any of those bands. Just looking at Kvelertak and WITTR in the same sentence feels really strange. 
p553
aVI agree. I think Kvelertak is just a very solid band making black metal influenced music. They don't really have a gimmick, don't claim to be anything they're not, and put on one hell of a show.
p554
aVMy mind immediately went Taake.
p555
aVI don't really know what black 'n' roll entails, but I think I can guess from the name. Vlad Tepes is a great Black Metal band. Although they're kvlt lo-fi shit, they have a lot of influence from Thrash, and I see a lot of similarities to Rock Music in general.
p556
aVThanks for the input - those bands, although good, sound more as though they're going back to the Venom thrash roots, whereas I'm looking for more along these lines. l https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_WlraCXwD0 l I know there's a group of younger British guys who fit this category, but fuck knows if I can remember what they're called. I'm pretty sure they had a debut release last year or the year before.

sVXasthur's new full length announced to be released in 2016
p611
(lp612
VNocturnal Poisoning is pretty abysmal, mostly because of the singing. I really hope he doesn't tarnish Xasthur's discography by combining the two. \u000a\u000aIf he wants to get back with Marissa Nadler and let her handle the singing, that'd be much better. 
p613
aVThe singing on Nocturnal Poisoning? Those vocals sound like all the vocals Scott has ever done. \u000a\u000aedit: TIL Nocturnal Poisoning is also his bluegrass band. Huh. How 'bout that. 
p614
aVAs a folk musician myself, calling that "bluegrass" is less accurate than calling Liturgy "black metal."
p615
aVWell, I didn't actually listen to it. I just googled it, and saw multiple references to Scott's "bluegrass band". I like bluegrass and I like Xasthur, but I really don't have any immediate interest in hearing him play what he calls bluegrass. 
p616
aV Sorry for the somewhat misleading title, it seems Scott wishes to release an acoustic/unplugged Xasthur album. 
p617
aVIt's a shame that he's lost interest in composing Black Metal songs, it would've been interesting to see a fusion of this "doomgrass" sound from Nocturnal Poisoning blend with the Black Metal/Dark Ambient elements of Xasthur
p618
aVIf he's lost interesting in BM, why release a new Xasthur album?
p619
aVDid you read the post?
p620
aV&gt; The next xasthur full length will be in 2016\u000a\u000aYeah?
p621
aV&gt;There's no need to rehash old xasthur songs, the acoustic ones are plenty dark, and sometimes they're not. If you've been listening, reading, thinking and getting it, we could call it Xasthur acoustic/unplugged with
p622
aVOh, *that* post. No, I didn't
p623
aVHe basically intends to continue composing this same style of music that's he's been doing with Nocturnal Poisoning just with the Xasthur name slapped onto it. He even calls it "Xasthur unplugged". To make it even more apparent, he had one of the Nocturnal Poisoning member redesign the Xasthur logo so that it looks more stripped back and sort of slick.
p624
aVI was excited when i read this earlier today, but the post, and Scott's post are a bit misleading.   His "reason" for bringing back Xasthur is for name recognition only, which sorta bums me out.\u000a\u000aXasthur was fucking AWESOME. He released some records that are just fantastic - but, Nocturnal Poisoning just, well, it's not that good.  It's also not appealing to fans of Xasthur because it's completely different music.

p724
(lp725
VI *really* don't like the orchestral arrangements. IMO good symphonic black metal should have subtlety - this doesn't, and the lyrics are just painful.\u000a\u000aI can't believe SoM, the same label that distributes Deathspell Omega, is putting this shit out. 
p726
aVWhile the lyrics may be pretty crappy.\u000a\u000aI still like the music so far :(.\u000a\u000a
p727
aVMeh...I loved the first song they released for this album but didn't care at all for the second one they released. Now this one had some decent parts but for the most part sounded quite generic. I love Carach Angren and all of their previous releases but this album isn't looking too good.
p728
aVThis is fucking reprehensibly bad
p729
aVAs someone who absolutely loved their first three albums, like listened to them straight for several months, I can unequivocally say, I hate this album.\u000a\u000aI have no idea what the hell they were thinking. They got rid of their trademark sound and the subject matter is stupid (for a black metal band). Disappointed.
p730
aVI totally agree, man. Their first albums were great, especially Where the Corpses Sink Forever. - That album was fucking golden, not one bad song on it. But this...I'm almost speechless. I still had hope, even after reading the album subject, name, ect., but before I even reached a minute into the video/song, I was beyond disappointed, and even laughing a little bit at the fucking awful, AWFUL, lyrics. The lyrics sounded like they were ripped from a Creepypasta written by a 2edgy4me fifteen-year-old who'd just discovered the power of adjectives. Nothing lead to a proper climax, not the lyrics, not the music, nothing. I literally just got done listening to the song, and I already can't remember even one riff from the entire eight minutes the song ran for. It was all just droning nonsense, from beginning to end.\u000a\u000aUgh...gonna have to wait another three years for an Angren album...hopefully that one will be good. :(
p731
aVOh my god, get out of my head! Seriously though, you literally stated exactly what I was telling my best friend. He loves (loved?) them as much as I did (totally agree about Where the Corpses Sink Forever, Funerary Dirge of the Violinist is just an amazing piece of music) and he thinks it's good (and I usually agree with him about 95% of the time). I can't convince him otherwise at this point, he's waiting to give the entire album a chance.\u000a\u000aAfter hearing the 1st song, I was like, "well, maybe the rest of the album won't suck this bad." After the 2nd song I said, "man, this album sounds like it's really going to suck, but to be fair I've only heard 22% of the album." Then there was today. Seriously, what the fuck?!?!?! A fucking clown, a CLOWN in a black metal song? I totaled up the times of the songs, it's about 16 minutes and 53 seconds. The average metal album is around 35 to 40 minutes, so we've basically heard half the album. That does not bode well.\u000a\u000aYour comment regarding the droning nonsense is spot on. One of the things I loved about them is the dynamic nature of their music. Take Funerary Dirge, it goes from fast, pounding metal, to amazing symphonics, to spoken word, then back to metal, etc.... This album (every song) has literally been tremolo picking and blast beats. If I wanted to hear that I'd listen to Cannibal Corpse or Deicide (which I won't because I hate that shit).\u000a\u000aSo, yeah, you're 100% right. Although, I fear that their next album will be crap too as this has started their downfall. It seems like 3 albums is the maximum a band can produce before declining. I used to love (like LOVE) Children of Bodom. I could play every song on my guitar, I had a custom ESP like Alexi, I even have the same gear in my rig (Lee Jackson Preamp, Intellifex reverb, etc...). Then Hatecrew came out, and I felt like, hmmm... this is different than before. After Hatecrew, I basically stopped listening. I really think 3 is the magic number.\u000a\u000aIt's good to know I'm not crazy and this album really does suck (as compared to their previous, maybe from some random band it would be ok, but knowing their history, it sucks).
p732
aVI'm glad you agree with my points. :) I haven't listened to the entire album yet, I'll probably pira-...uh...buy it later next week if I get the chance. And, I can understand if Carach wanted to do something different, but if you're gonna' do something this terribly different, just start a god damn side project for fuck's sake and stop tainting the (what was) otherwise perfect name of Carach Angren. But, I think you're right about the three golden albums thing. I've seen that go through a lot of bands. I mean, it happened to Darkthrone. Their second, third and fourth albums were fucking amazing. Then, after that, they just slowly declined into a glob of shitty shit-shit. I think there's some sort of undiscovered arbitrary musical entropy that activates after a good metal band makes three consecutively good albums. It angers me... But, if I could defend Carach Angren on this, the only defense I could truthfully give, is that there's no way in hell they were going to make an album better than Where the Corpses Sink Forever. Once you've hit the top, there's only way to go. That album was the best album I'd ever heard aside from a select few.\u000aWhere the Corpses Sink Forever was not only masterfully played and composed, but the song placement within the album was also fucking genius. Every song slightly referenced a song prior. If you were to just listen to one of the songs by itself, it wouldn't seem like anything special (unless of course you're listening to The Funerary Dirge of a Violinist, which is easily amazing by itself), but if you listen to the entire album; each song uses perfect context and slightly references a different song. It's amazing. Listening to just only one song of Where the Corpses Sink Forever is like watching only one scene to an amazing movie.
p733
aVI agree with 100% of what you've said. About Corpses, you're totally right, it's like one perfectly awesome scene from a movie. It really does transport you somewhere. That's what I love(d) about Carach Angren. Their music was theatrical. Now maybe that's not "black metal" in the traditional sense, but I think that's BS. If Mayhem had access to money and studios, they wouldn't have been recording in the woods in Norway with a cassette deck.\u000a\u000aI've noticed other bands, when they hit the "perfect" album, it's hard to match that. For me it was Follow the Reaper by Bodom, Clayman for In Flames, Progenies by Dimmu, IX Equilibrium by Emperor, and that's all I can think of right now. I'm still waiting to see if Wintersun can keep up their epic awesomeness (Jari's kind of my hero in music).\u000a\u000aIn any case, stay strong brother! Hopefully you're right and Carach Angren's next album won't suck as bad. Until then, may you stumble across some kick ass bands!\u000a\u000aAlso, I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that it's nice to talk to a fellow metal head that can articulate why the music is phenomenal. That's a rare quality, and awesome to find in a fellow metal head.

aVUnless I'm mistaken, Wylve basically disbanded after that demo. But there's good news! They (he?) are reformed as Lluvia, which is an even better band in my opinion.

p778
aVWell Deafheaven are just the Burzum sound with a bit of shoegaze mixed in as far as I can tell, so you'd probably like Amesoeurs and Alcest.\u000a\u000aI don't feel like it should be described as "post-black metal" though, the sound has been around for 20 years and there's nothing new or interesting about it.\u000a\u000aI've heard "post-black metal" used to describe second wave black metal bands who veered off into avantgarde territory like Arcturus and Sigh, I'm not sure if that's commonly held though.
p779
aVAwesome, thank you for the detailed reply. I do enjoy Alcest, ill have to give Amesoeurs a spin, as well as Arcturus and Sigh. \u000a\u000aIm not to big on the specifics of genre or post this or post that. I saw them described as such, hence why I label them that here. 
p780
aVNo problem. I think what you're describing as post-black metal is a portmanteau of black metal and post-rock, whereas the older definition is post-black metal in the way that post-punk is to punk, if that makes any sense, but then it's got so much variety within it that it's hard to lump it into a single genre at all, it's more just a name for a collection of bands that went weird?
p781
aVI agree with that. Either bands carry on with what they know will work or they get out and branch out to other genres. Such is music.
p782
aVAs mentioned above, Lantlos, which shares members with Alcest. Also, try Fen, Averse, and Woman is the Earth
p783
aVAmesoeurs, Alcest, and Deafheaven all sound nothing alike. Also wait until the people who think Deafheaven are screamo come into the thread. Actually, they're likely going to avoid the thread, considering that this basically equates Burzum to screamo in their eyes.

aVHow do people like this band
p821
aVI don't really listen to much symphonic black metal but this is one that knows what they're doing. Atmospheric appeal I assume.
p822
aVTheir first 3 albums were amazing and if you're a fan of symphonic black metal, I would advise you to check them out.\u000a\u000aHowever, I would not start with this album. In my opinion it is terrible. The only redeeming aspects are the symphonic parts. The guitars used to be relatively melodic, staying in key, and acted as a lead for the symphonic aspects. In this album, the guitars work against the rest of the music, creating a cacophony.\u000a\u000aFurther, the theme is utterly stupid. It's literally about Fairytales, specifically Hansel and Gretel. While I'm not saying there's absolutely no way an album regarding Fairytales wouldn't suck, that is not the case here. In my opinion (and I really did love this band prior to hearing this album), it sounds like a sociopathic 6 year old wrote this album while snorting meth.
p823
aVYeah I don't know, I like my black metal to have some form of fantasy but I watched the lyric video and cringed at "domestic violence"...
p824
aVCringe when he straight up talks about Hansel and Gretel or screams "Mommyyyyyyyyyyy" (or Momma or something like that). Contrast this with Funerary Dirge of the Violinist and you can see why I truly dislike this album and really lost faith in the band.

aVIt looks cool and I want it. What is it?

p869
aVI pointed this out when this was posted a while back, haha. It's a fucking joke and the hypers have lost all credibility.
p870
aVWhy is it a joke? \u000a\u000aAnd before you make the *it's not black metal* argument, I more or less agree with that, but there's enough similarity that it warrants being posted here, I think.
p871
aVGolden Number is not emblematic of the rest of the album at all too. I was thinking this album was gonna be Sunbather worship but it really isn't. 
p872
aVIt's a joke because so called "Black Metal" fans here are praising this album. You can't be a fan of Black Metal, and then enjoy something like this. Or claim that it even has similarities to Black Metal. This is a joke, and the band should just kill themselves already.
p873
aV&gt; You can't be a fan of Black Metal, and then enjoy something like this. \u000a\u000aThis sentiment is obnoxious and outdated. Nobody should care if you enjoy both post-rock and actual black metal. 
p874
aVEither way, stuff like this shouldn't be posted here.
p875
aVFair enough. I'd say that there really isn't that much black metal in this record apart from the second track. They probably are getting a pass due to their previous output. 
p876
aVI haven't heard their first album, it just seems a bit too edgy for me. And a bit stupid, to be honest. For example, one of the songs on that album is literally a minute of silence. How much more pretentious/edgy can you get?
p877
aV&gt; How much more pretentious/edgy can you get?\u000a\u000aIdk. You could post multiple times on the same reddit thread that a band should kill themselves. That's super edgy. 
p878
aVI thought I made it quite clear that I don't just go around telling people online to "Kill themselves". Because that's rude and edgy.\u000a\u000aBut in this case, they really should kill themselves. They even named their band after a method of suicide. "Boohoo, life is so tough." If it really is so tough, then go kill yourselves already. Preferably by a Ghost Bath, hehe....\u000a\u000aIt's for this reason that [Nidhoggr](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nidhoggr/11720) is one of my favourite DSBM bands. At least he went through with it. Seriously, am I the only sensible one here?
p879
aVSo Cannibal Corpse should fuck you with a knife? Behemoth should actually sculp the throne ov Seth? Shining should all commit suicide? TotalSelfHatred should hate themselves? I can keep going like this, but you get the point.\u000a\u000aHow thick do you have to be to spew out this nonsense. \u000a\u000a"You can't be a fan of Black Metal, and then enjoy something like this."\u000a\u000aWho the hell are you to tell me I can't be a black metal fan because I enjoy riffs like this? So I can't enjoy wine or whiskey because I enjoy beer? How old are you?\u000a\u000aLots of questions, answer them at your own pace buddy.
p880
aVWhat I mean is: I don't want stuff like this in /r/BlackMetal. What am I supposed to do if I enjoy actual traditional Black Metal? "Blackgaze" and Black Metal should have no overlap in fanbase. \u000a\u000aAlso, I'm not saying all bands should follow exactly what their lyrical content says. But Cannibal Corpse doesn't talk about violating you with a knife during interviews, do they? Ghost Bath, even in official interviews, continue to spout their garbage about hating themselves. The world would be better off without them.
p881
aVYou could write entire albums designed around "spells to fall asleep by", which, if not for legacy aspects, would come across as pretty fucking stupid. 
p882
aVI assume you're referring to Burzum? \u000a\u000aWell, if so, you're incorrect. I've fallen asleep to Burzum numerous times, only proving that the purpose of his albums seems to be effective. He's actually committed to his theme, and has never drastically changed his sound away from the "Spells to fall asleep by". He's committed to that sound, and has no reason to change it. He pioneered Black/Ambient Metal, and many bands have copied him. \u000a\u000aI would respect Ghost Bath a lot more if they gave themselves a Ghost Bath.
p883
aVJust another band sucking the dick of trends and indie rock critics. There's no sense of identity to bands like this or sunbather, just endless aping of albums that came out 10 years ago packaged in an easily digestible format. No point in even mentioning that here cause the 20-something's will down vote you away. But why does everything have to be such a copy? Whenever one band does something slightly unique suddenly it's a thing and bands like this have to come and act like they own it. So weird to me.  Blackgaze doesn't have to be a thing.  
p884
aVGranted, I didn't really give them a chance. Once that riff came in, I stopped. It was sounding really evil for a minute and a half, then IDK I'm just not looking for that. Maybe I'm picky. 
p885
aVSay what you will about Deafheaven or blackgaze comparisons - this is damn good. I've been waiting to hear this for a while and it did not disappoint. 
p886
aVThese guys are really overrated. I think the only reason why they're getting so much hype is because they're from China. If they really hate life so much, they should all just kill themselves, rather than torturing the world with their hipster scene kid depressive garbage.
p887
aVI doubt they're even actually from China.  This whole thing is way too perfect of a package for Western media outlets to be real.  There's something very calculated about the whole thing and it makes me immediately suspicious.  Velvet Cacoon v.2.0  \u000a\u000aEdit: According to M-A all the members are American.  Bullshit publicity stunt.   
p888
aVOne member is American and they recorded in America is what I heard. The singer and the primary songwriter are for sure Chinese.
p889
aV&gt; for sure Chinese\u000a\u000aIs there any actual proof of that?  They almost never post to their Facebook page in Chinese (and certainly never beyond a sentence), all their lyrics are from what I can tell totally devoid of any grammatical/syntactical errors (which is an improbably impressive feat given that Scandinavian bands make mistakes all the time and they learn English in grammar school), almost all of their promotional pictures appear to be taken in North America (since Chinese graveyards are not the same as ours, and it doesn't really snow in Chongqing), they for sure recorded in the US since they said as much in the interview that got posted here somewhere, and they're suspiciously coy about their actual location.  It's actually not a trivial thing for a Chinese person to get even a US tourist visa, and recording might require a temporary work visa, which are even harder still to get.  \u000a\u000aSo yeah, it's *possible* that they might be Chinese, but I think it's very unlikely given how disconnected they seem to be from really anything in China and how connected they are to Western labels and media outlets instead.
p890
aV&gt; Velvet Cacoon v.2.0\u000a\u000aNever really followed Velvet Cacoon. What was their deal? 
p891
aVThey lied a lot about their backstory, but they also stole music from other people (which to be clear, I am not accusing this band of doing).  Their singer claimed to have been committed to an asylum, and they supposedly used a special "diesel-powered" guitar to record with, but he later admitted it was all fake.  
p892
aVDon't you have a Der Stürmer song to overpraise or something?
p893
aVDer Sturmer is pretty good; Dark Fury is better, imo.
p894
aVI can't stand Der Stürmer. Think they're boring as fuck. For me it's a band for whom politics matters more than music. 
p895
aVI'm not really a huge fan of Der Stürmer, to be honest. When I want NS music, I listen to RAC.
p896
aVYou 'want' NS music? As if you could ever possibly discern the difference from regular black or death metal without having already known they were a NS band?\u000a\u000aBut anyway, RAC sucks and Arghoslent and GBK fucking rule.
p897
aVYou know what I mean. If I'm in the mood for NS, I prefer listening to RAC over NSBM. \u000a\u000aAnd I'll have you know, RAC does *not* suck. Maybe some of the big names do, but there are some real gems. I suggest:\u000a\u000aLandser, No Remorse, Honor, Aryan Terrorism, Pluton Svea, Blue Eyed Devils, and Evil Skins. Skrewdriver isn't too bad either.\u000a\u000aBut yes, I agree that GBK and Arghoslent are great. But GBK is heavily inspired by RAC, so there's really no reason as to why you may think RAC sucks.

VThe isolated Bluegrass tracks on this album are great, but the actual Black Metal just falls flat. I give this guy credit for creativity though, because he has a very cool idea. It's just that the execution of the actual Black Metal isn't very good, and he tends to just isolate the Black Metal and the Bluegrass, rather than combining them. 
p937
aVI prefer that imo. It's hard to mix those instruments together effectively because a banjo especially would get lost in the mix. Not to mention it's played different than the guitars are. I think he does a good job though at bringing in strings and flutes when necessary.

aVI use Ofermod as the standard for orthodox bm(as well as dso). I'd listen to more of their stuff.

aVYou'll probably enjoy Raison d'être, Kammarheit, Megaptera, and anything featured on a Cryo Chamber mix.

aVI'm trying to find more synth/keyboard based but holy hell, I checked them out and was impressed. Space themed black metal is very interesting.
p1098
aVI recommend Lord Lodivicus for good dungeon synth. And Summoning is godlike in that regard.
p1099
aVI'm not exactly sure what dungeon synth is, but I think you'll like Desiderii Marginis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNGaJ-0bwlE\u000aAnd you have to check out Lustmord for sure\u000a

p1243
(lp1244
VReal cool guy made that video. Man I can't think of any interviews where someone in Emperor went on about nature, or like the majesty of the night sky beyond the great vast forest or something. 
p1245
aVI like how he calls it Hipster black metal though. There is some truth to that. I think they brought the nature thing to a new level though, making it the central theme of the genre and trying to reflect that musically. Emperor for example will still have this more Satanic feel to it. 
p1246
aVI do agree. And it did come off as cliche. Never got into this band, but there is a giant precedent for what they were saying. I've got some books with interviews from the old norwegian guys and they sound similar. 
p1247
aVYeah, it's this classic black metal we're extreme elitist bullcrap again. Musically I like Cascadian black metal though, but I just hope they don't become a rehash and circlejerk of each other.
p1248
aVI bought like six records from a guy who was selling his collection (mostly early/mid-2000s hardcore which I've been into since that era), and a copy of the mail order Malevolent Grain on forest green was part. I wonder if it's worth anything. 
p1249
aVi get the fact that its a bit repetitive but the fact about them saying they want to be one with nature and their surroundings isn't something new to the genre of black metal and its sub genres.\u000a\u000ai however am a fan of the "movement" if you will i absolutly adore Alda and Ash Borer, as far as i'm concerned good music is good music and while i may not be a huge WITTR fan some of their stuff is quite good.
p1250
aVThis is the first time I've heard WITTR &amp; based on those snippets he put in the video they sound like pretty par for the course black metal.\u000a\u000aNot that that's a bad thing, but it's not super unique.
p1251
aVIt's old news and I imagine I'm not the only one tired of talking about it
p1252
aVI'm a big fan of American and Cascadian BM, for the most part; it nails the hypnotic aspect of the genre that I'm drawn to, and as others have said, all the nature talk isn't exactly outside the established confines of the genre. That said, this video is just pointless and catty, and I'd like to know what this guy has contributed to black metal himself.
p1253
aVIIRC, there's a conceptual reason why the music is as repetitive (read: cyclical) as it is. It has to do with natural seasons and life &amp; death cycles. Not that that's any kind of excuse, but listen to any of the bands also in the scene (Fauna, Skagos, Echtra, etc) and you'll find the same conceptual symmetry.
p1254
aVI like some of it. However most pretty black metal i like is not cascadian or from the us.
p1255
aVI like it because I LOVE drone music and the cascadian stuff reminds me of drone, the only difference is they just tremolo pick instead of play one long note lol
p1256
aVI like the wall of sound effect it has too. It's very entrancing.
p1257
aVyep, I'm honestly not the biggest fan of the cascadian stuff, but I'll be damned if I'm not a sucker for W.O.S. production
p1258
aVThe video itself is dumb. It's already been said here, but for the most part, most bands living a "trve" black metal lifestyle, are dark hippies. Nothing wrong with that; however, wittr seem pretty pretentious and their music is contrived and not very original and lacks any musical dynamic IMO. If nothing else, it's not much of anything to be praised. 
p1259
aVFart noises huh\u000a\u000aHow elite\u000a\u000aThat being said, WitTR are okay. Not great, and not consistent. Ash Borer ruin them at their own game.

Vlol. he's such a self righteous pseudo nietzschean jerk off.
p1263
aVAny idea what Phil did to prompt this? Is it his work with Recluse? 
p1264
aVI don't know the full story but Phil and Mike Meachem (Loss, and also of Recluse) have been feeling the need to assert themselves on social media and thus have been acting like a couple of small children. Take a look at [this article](http://meatmeadmetal.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/on-hatred-respect-and-treating-people-like-humans-in-heavy-metal-circles/) or look at the "Grim Kim Controversy" thread from yesterday for more info.   
p1265
aVI'm more than willing to set aside even the dumbest ideological positions for the sake of art and music (I've been on a Peste Noire kick for a week, so I'd have to), but I've seen too many instances of bands tearing themselves apart over one person. It's often a personality thing.\u000a\u000aFuck if I'm not gonna miss Cobalt with McSorley, though.
p1266
aVthis is fine and all but i don't want to be pals with anyone in a metal community so much as i just want another cobalt album
p1267
aVThat article is so fucking annoying, since when is metal a cohesive "community", just because i like a certain type of music doesn't mean I have to live up to some certain moral standards. now a days it seems like the metal shows I go to is about half girls, half dudes anyway. I've never once seen a woman or gay person be accosted for being at a metal show. The only basis I kind of get for this guy's points he's trying to make is on social media, and guess what, it's the fucking internet and on the internet it's not just the metal "community" that's racist and sexist you can't look up a kitten video without racist and sexists remarks
p1268
aV[deleted]
p1269
aVThat article gave me cancer. 
p1270
aVThat article and the entire controversy is really stupid. Metal isn't a socio-political arena by any stretch. And all the metalheads that say that "Metal is a community; it's like family" are always some tasteless burnout, dive-venue groupie or stinky half-crust drug addict. I've never known any of the metal friends I respect to ever point out something negative in a person on behalf of metal like they're some representative. It wouldn't be weird to think of McSorley as a jerk, but for fuck's sake, this irrelevant PC heavy metal castration crusade is godamned redundant. No one is gonna have a revalation because of an annoying editorial. Such things are just polarizing self affirmation from bitchy hippies in jean vests. Let individuals (and even bands) be responsible for themselves instead of tying their actions to a non-existent social faction by saying metal is misogynistic/homophobic. Fuck hippies posing as metalheads and their brainless political hogwash.  
p1271
aV&gt; Metal isn't a socio-political arena by any stretch.\u000a\u000aUhh, there have been songs about socio-political issues since metal's inception. You sure about that?\u000a\u000a&gt; I've never known any of the metal friends I respect to ever point out something negative in a person on behalf of metal like they're some representative.\u000a\u000aWell, that's exactly what Phil was doing. Just sayin'.\u000a\u000aLook, the whole "Metal is a family u guyz" shit rubs me the wrong way too but this comes down to a dude being a raging internet tough guy dickhead on facebook and another guy in his band not wanting to be associated with it. Seems perfectly reasonable to me. \u000a
p1272
aVLOL @ calling Phil an "internet tough guy".   You have no idea how wrong you are.   
p1273
aVI'm fully aware that he's in the military. Doesn't change the fact that making empty, stupid threats and shittalk on social media is "internet tough guy" talk. 
p1274
aVIt's not ITG if the person would gladly and eagerly say it to your face in person.  You think Phil's intimidated by some hipster mangina in a jean jacket?  
p1275
aVNo, I don't think he's intimidated but he's still coming off like a juvenile, insecure, jerk regardless of whether he'd say the same thing in real life or not. 
p1276
aVMaybe to you.  I think he's telling it like it is.  \u000aThe USBM "community" is a joke.  Music journalism is an even bigger joke.   \u000a\u000aWhat's juvenile and insecure is glorifying music about death and hate and darkness... while being an overly sensitive sissy who uses SJW codewords and gets buttupset at the word "faggots".  At least Phil believes in what he writes.  At least he *lives* it.  I really don't even need to defend him because he honestly doesn't care about any of the supposed fallout from his remarks.  He finds it amusing.        
p1277
aV&gt; At least Phil believes in what he writes.\u000a\u000aUntil he deletes it from facebook like he does all the time. Same thing with Meacham for that matter.\u000a\u000aI guess policing bands on social media for not being "manly" enough (this after he's publicly praised Caina in the past), counts as "telling it like it is" these days. Seems really childish to me but whatever. Recluse and Cobalt will go on and this will all be forgotten about by the end of the week. \u000a\u000a
p1278
aVActually, most of the people that have spoken up in defense of Kim and in opposition to Mike and Phil aren't "tasteless burnout, dive-venue groupie or stinky half-crust drug addict" but rather some of the most prominent members of the music-making community as well as a lot of well-respected journalists.\u000a\u000aI've known Phil online for a number of years and cut him out of personal correspondence because his racism, homophobia, and misogyny have just plain gotten out of hand.  It's inexcusable behavior in any social circle, only this time he chose to take a swing at one of the biggest metal journalists and promoters in the game.
p1279
aVAll I see is a bunch of butthurt whiteknights upset that Phil took a shot at a woman.  
p1280
aVTruth.  The metal "community" is comprised of PC hipster sissies.   
p1281
aVFucking thank you.

aVWhat a bunch of SJW horseshit that article is.
p1283
aVthis articile made me sick, it really did. I didn't realize that "black metal community" is bunch of politically correct kids fighting for "equality", "tolerance" and shit like that.\u000a\u000aBut it's just USA. In eastern Europe most of (good) bands declare themselves as nazis :).\u000a\u000a\u000aalso\u000a&gt;Are we not all laughing at Varg these days?\u000ahow about fuck off? Varg was THE MOST infuential person for the scene, both musically and ideologically.
p1284
aVThis, so much this.  Black metal isn't about acceptance.  It's about hatred.  If you aren't down with hatred, fuck off, your flowery bullshit is **not wanted**.
p1285
aVThe music at its core is indeed about an expression of hatred but who says you have to be a raging dickhead in order to make it or enjoy it? I have plenty of hatred within me but somehow I'm able to not be a cunt out in public. Most musicians who make black metal are the same by the way (unless you only listen to Eastern European NS bands, in which case, can't really speak for them).
p1286
aVSo in other words, hate all you want, as long as your hatred is confined to a number of set subjects pre-approved by your local college cultural studies department.  Rock and roll, man!
p1287
aVThat's not what I'm saying at all. I don't care what people want to do with their music. I'm not asking for censorship of art. Far from it in fact. This whole thing is based on treating other people within the scene like people based on their actions (and taste preferably). I'd rather someone be judged on whether or not they find Liturgy to be palatable than if they're gay or a woman. If that's not black metal enough, I really couldn't give less of a shit. Guess what? Logan from Diocletian loves Taylor Swift. MkM and countless others are huge Lana Del Rey fans. Paul Ledney does embroidery. No one is 100% black metal all day every day and most people don't want to be. \u000a\u000aUphold traditions of hatred in music, even ones expressing NS ideals? Fine, but to force everyone who enjoys this music to abide by it constantly outside of an artistic context is outdated and stupid honestly. 
p1288
aVSo you want the hatred confined to the music?  Somehow I don't think you'd be alright with McSorley writing a song about how much he hates Kim Kelly and Caïna.  Seems to me like he was attacking people for their actions, namely their efforts to force left-wing tolerance ideology onto the black metal "scene," and he used exactly the kind of language guaranteed to piss off both them and their allies.  Seems to me like he did a good job of it too.  Although major caveat, I'm not cool enough to be Facebook friends with them.  \u000a\u000aAnyway, though you claim not to want to censor the art, you definitely want to censor the artist, which is effectively the same thing.  If you blackball all the people who are truly misanthropic and thus treat others with an automatic lack of respect, then there's no need to censor the music because you've already removed everyone who would have made something transgressive.  \u000a\u000a&gt;   Guess what? Logan from Diocletian loves Taylor Swift. MkM and countless others are huge Lana Del Rey fans. Paul Ledney does embroidery.\u000a\u000aIrrelevant, but great namedropping there.  Am I supposed to be impressed?  If they start calling for putting rape trigger warnings on Clandestine Blaze albums, then I'll care.\u000a\u000a&gt; force everyone who enjoys this music to abide by it constantly outside of an artistic context\u000a\u000aNo one's forcing anyone to do anything, except you people trying to apply whatever pressure you can to force them to shut up.  You don't have to friend them or tweet them or buy their records.  Anyone coming into black metal expecting to not be offended deserves to be made uncomfortable.
p1289
aVWhat pressure exactly and who is being forced to shut up? Phil is still doing Recluse. Nothing has changed beyond Erik and Phil splitting up. He can still say whatever the hell he wants. Doesn't mean he's going to avoid criticism for what he says though. No one told Erik to do what he did and if he can't get on with someone anymore to the point that it impacts him creatively, then how is he supposed to continue on with that person? I get what you're saying about people with certain personality types making transgressive music but I don't think any metal writer has the power to "blackball" any band (let alone remove them) unless you mean not giving them press, or giving them negative press (which probably helps them honestly), which is entirely within their right to do. \u000a\u000aAnd for the record, I named those artists as examples of people with relatively decent reputations for hateful black metal because who is honestly as truly misanthropic as they claim to be? Even Phil gets concerned about how things he says are perceived (if he wasn't, he might leave his messages up where he attacks fans for asking questions about their orders). 
p1290
aVIt's pretty obvious that you view the "scene" or "community" as a wonderful thing to belong to, and it stands to reason that being cast out of that "scene" is a pretty serious punishment.  I also anticipate that much like anyone who associates with other people who have offended current-wave feminists, their labels are going to start getting a lot of shit and will be forced to drop them.  \u000a\u000aYou don't get to support the imposition of current-wave feminism and left-wing "safe space" ideology onto black metal, which you clearly do given your consistent support for its proponents, and then at the same time pretend that you have no interest in eradicating certain viewpoints, because those two things are in effect the same.  It's really no secret that the movement is censorious - "you can't say that" is basically the battle cry.  Any college campus provides plenty of evidence of the use of speech codes and hecklers' vetoes, and now the same kind of rhetoric pops up [again](http://shamelessnavelgazing.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/inquisition-and-black-metals-fascism-problem/) and [again](http://meatmeadmetal.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/on-hatred-respect-and-treating-people-like-humans-in-heavy-metal-circles/) and [again](http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/caina-settler-of-unseen-snares-broken-limbs-interview-up-next/) in relation to black metal.  Real black metal is and always has been a reactionary, individualist movement - not only is all this social justice crap totally foreign to it, but it is antithetical to it.  Anyone who takes the side of musicians or writers who pretend to the contrary is an enemy of everything the music stands for.\u000a\u000aLike I said, I don't care if Belkètre had a knitting circle in their spare time.  Everyone has extracurricular hobbies.  No one is bringing Lana del Rey into black metal, but the people you support are trying to bring social justice into black metal.  Neither of those things belongs there.  Have the good sense to keep them out.  
p1291
aVC'mon, name one black metal band who's been dropped by a label for pissing off feminists or racism awareness groups or whatever. One article now and then speculating about somebody's fringe right leanings or advocating some cultural change (and these are the ones everybody seems to cite since there really aren't *that* many) doth not a censorship crusade make.\u000a\u000aThere are like five openly racist metal (not even nsbm) groups that people outside that ideology give a shit about anyway, with *maaaybe* Arghoslent and GBK being the only really prominent ones outside of second-wave bm. And in the case of the second wave, people respect them musically but generally find them as people to be laughable clowns at best or at worst, obnoxious fuckheads who pulled a tantrum and did dumb shit their progenitors are still pulling away from and disclaiming. Pretty much EVERYBODY has moved on from the ideological baggage, hardly the far-right unanimity you're portraying.
p1292
aVI never said all black metal bands are right-wing, only that there is a general anti-PC-garbage attitude.  And outside of the Pitchfork "USBM" scene, there definitely is.  I guess if EVERYBODY has moved on from "ideological baggage" as you say, pretty much the sum total of Finnish black metal bands missed that memo, since in all the interviews I've read/heard they emphasize the importance of anti-social ideology in black metal as a whole (examples: [1](http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=1-335), [2](http://wyrdwordsandeffigies.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/interview-with-finnish-black-metal-band-forgjord/), pretty much the entire Loputon Gehennan Liekki documentary).  The same would go for most Polish bands, from Graveland, Fullmoon, and Veles in the 1990s through to Ohtar, Dark Fury, Szron in the 2000s and nowadays, and many of the most prominent bands from Ukraine (e.g. Drudkh, Hate Forest, Kroda).  But then again, someone told me that no one cares about any of these bands, so they are irrelevant and we should only care about what luminaries like Deafheaven think.  \u000a\u000aFortunately, most labels have the testicular fortitude to resist dropping bands with unsavory views, but venues are constantly canceling events or facing intense pressure to cancel events based on the wild speculations of antifa groups, even in North America (example: the first Messe des Morts festival almost did not occur as described in the first paragraph [here](http://www.u-zine.org/interview.php?id=275) - "...ces emmerdeurs de rouges extrémistes et la salle de concert ont encore essayé d\u2019annuler notre concert (comme cela arrive régulièrement à différents groupes en se basant sur de faux jugements et des accusations infondées). Mais, lors du spectacle, le public a exprimé son mécontentement, ils ont donc échoué...").  But again I guess that  no one cares about bands from Québec like Forteresse or Monarque, only good wholesome American bands.  \u000a\u000aYou don't have to be a Nazi or a fascist to attack the appropriation of black metal by groups who are diametrically opposed to the whole idea behind the genre (and who bear a strong resemblance to Christians in their enthusiasm for peace, love, and tolerance).  It is extremely irritating to find it suddenly filled with "USBM" fans whose defining characteristic is their wimpish oversensitivity.  Casual listeners and pseudo-Christians should have no place in black metal.
p1293
aVI guess I disagree with the assumption that a subgenre ought to have any particular ideological bent behind it. I mean, despite some album titles or liner notes luminaries like Darkthrone and Immortal (who even devotees ought to respect for their earlier work) have made a point to distance themselves from misanthropy and bigotry, and even many ambiguous acts like Drudkh which hit on the pagan/heritage themes often avoid any explicit political commentary, leaving anybody guessing what they might actually believe along those lines.\u000a\u000aIs there something "more" legitimate, qualitatively speaking, to misanthropic, ugly, jagged, bm? Sure, for most people, and I definitely share in that preference. But I think if you were to perform a survey most people see that as a frequent trapping of the genre rather than some sort of ideological alignment, and there's room for a Slechtvalk or an Antestor every now and then, or the legions of bm fans who hear a lot of the initially raucuous noise as nostalgic or affirming or contemplative in an odd way after acclimating to it. Many of the really gnarly themes of metal are just a proxy for an assertion of individuality anyway, unless you're Jon Nodtveidt and think you're gonna summon a dragon with your lyrics or oughta go stab somebody for being different or something. People saw the consequences of that second wave nonsense, and even those who didn't see it as an obnoxious reactionary temper tantrum eventually decided that the consequences of actually embracing it just weren't worth it.\u000a\u000aThen again, the mere sound of the music is often intended to differentiate itself from anything your average person might like, and intended to assure underground status (even if you don't intentionally prune your fanbase like Peste Noire or something), which may be seen as implicitly misanthropic, so maybe I'm completely wrong here.
p1294
aVJust read the thread. The story is all there. Honestly, I'll be happy when this is all over. 
p1295
aVThe single worst thing that could ever happen to metal would be to make it PC in any way, shape, or form.  Too bad Erik Wunder won't let his bandmate's opinions stand or fall on their own, and evidently doesn't think he has the right to keep them without penalty.
p1296
aVOr maybe his opinions are damaging to the creation of his art? Why would you work on an artistic endeavor with someone who you can't relate to anymore or who has now made your band associated with noxious politics that you never wanted in the first place? That would be lying to yourself if anything.\u000a\u000aNo, metal will never become "PC" but that doesn't mean bands have to tolerate their reputations being dragged through the dirt on account of a band member publicly being a bigoted cunt. Winterfylleth did a similar thing when a guitarist started yapping about "White Pride Worldwide". If Erik was concerned about being "PC", he would have dropped Phil a long time ago as he's been saying shit like this for years.
p1297
aVI would work with somebody, even befriend somebody, whose ideological views do not match my own, or whose politics I found "noxious".  I realize that I'm in the minority on that, but I think its a big part of why I see the world as such a divided and partisan place.  Having read McSorley's facebook comments I can't really defend him - not for the content, but for the juvenile way in which he delivered them (and, as a personal insult to someone).  If this is indicative of his general demeanor these days then I suppose I understand the decision a little better.

aV&gt; I would work with somebody, even befriend somebody, whose ideological views do not match my own, or whose politics I found "noxious". I realize that I'm in the minority on that.\u000a\u000aNo no, I'm glad you responded as you did. I'm friends, and family for that matter, with people who don't share my politics. There's no need to divide your friends among political lines (I probably wouldn't associate with an out and proud Nazi honestly, but that's just me).\u000a\u000a&gt; Having read McSorley's facebook comments I can't really defend him - not for the content, but for the juvenile way in which he delivered them (and, as a personal insult to someone).

Stuff about "killing towelheads" and racist caricatures. This is just the first time he's gone out of his way to attack people (completely unprovoked by the way) personally and this is very indicative of his general demeanor these days. At a certain point, you can't excuse it anymore because it starts to affect your reputation as an artist which is clearly worth more to Erik than keeping Phil around (which is completely understandable and reasonable IMO).

aVThe rest is a little faster, I guess. If you're looking for slow black metal, check the song Black Lava by Satyricon, and The Abyss Looks Into Me by Oathbreaker. They have that same kind of slow filthy black metal sounds. If you find any more, please let me know ;)

Checking out his independent stuff I stumbled upon "Souvenirs D'un Autre Monde" first. I liked it, but it took me a couple listens to really vibe with the sound. After that I explored his earlier stuff (this was like 2009 at the time), and naturally loved it. I think that through seeing the range of music helped me appreciate is more traditional BM style a lot more. \u000a\u000aUnquestionably Neige is on my shortlist for top musical artists.
p1421
aVYes. I first listened to Les Voyages and thought it was meh. Then, a few years later I stumbled upon "Sur L'Ocean Couleur De Fer" from Ecailles De Lune and it absolutely blew me away. At that point, I realized how wrong I was before and found the true beauty in Alcest's music. Their debut is now one of my Top 20 albums of all time.
p1422
aVYeah i did, but live i thought they sounded too much like the records.
p1423
aVI did actually. I'm still desiding if I like the new release. I've only gone over it scarcely when it first came out. Need to really feel it ya know? Like most things I eventually find something I like in something. 
p1424
aVGive it another listen. At first I felt it was a really mediocre album but now I pretty much love all the songs on it other than Away. Try 'La Nuit avec Moi' and 'Délivrance.' The bonus track 'Into the Waves' is amazing too, and the lyrics are way darker than the music itself suggests.
p1425
aVI liked the demo and the EP right away. When *Souvenirs d'un autre monde* came out I fucking hated it because I was expecting more along the lines of *Le Secret*. Upon returning to it several months later knowing what it was like I started to enjoy it. I liked *Écailles de lune* to some extent as well, but that's the last one I derived any real enjoyment from. Their last two have taken too radical a departure from even the early -gaze stuff to something that's... I don't know, it lacks the charm that was present on the previous albums.
p1426
aVYep, in live at the Hellfest (2012)
p1427
aVYes. I heard *Écailles de lune* and *Le Secret* right around the time the latter was re-released and I was blown away.
p1428
aVYes!
p1429
aVYes. Something about Alcest just clicked with me, and I've been obsessed ever since.
p1430
aVWell, I needed some time to love alcest as much as now but I already liked it when I first listened to it.
p1431
aVYes
p1432
aVEh, I liked Alcest when I first listened to it but it became less and less interesting. It was easy to, but just, pretty and not really my vibe.
p1433
aVMy first altercation with Alcest was when they released "Souvenirs D'un Autre Monde" and yes, I loved it from the very beginning. That album is fucking golden. \u000a\u000aAmesouers and Lantlôs is also very good, not that I think he's been so much involved in Lantlôs.
p1434
aVStill love "Le Secret" and "Souvenirs" but not much for his newer material. 
p1435
aVNah, dude. Doesn't hate itself enough.

aV&gt;Alcest isn't a Black Metal band.\u000a\u000aOh fuck off, they used to be. They've made black metal music and they've made music heavily influenced by black metal. We can still talk about that music.

They don't need to be one for them to be relevant on this subreddit because their music is clearly on some level black metal-influenced, even if on their last album that influence is gone. This subreddit isn't just for pure black metal bands. Wolves in the Throne Room aren't *'just'* a black metal band, but that doesn't mean it isn't (or wasn't before they were blacklisted) relevant to post them here. Really tired of having the 'Is Alcest black metal?' argument every time they're posted/mentioned on this sub.

p1463
aVDefinitely one of the best vocalists around. He's also in Blood of Kingu, but I could never get into them myself. But his work in Drudkh is phenomenal. 
p1464
aVProbably because he doesn't do vocals in Drudkh, only guitars.  Thurios is the vocalist in Drudkh (and in Astrofaes, which contrary to what the guy above you said is his project and not Roman's).

p1659
aVDamn, this is a broad question. What parts of the 90s stuff do you like? Some of my personal favorites:\u000a\u000a\u000aSargeist - Let the Devil In (pretty orthodox)\u000a\u000aXasthur - The Funeral of Being (depressive and hypnotic)\u000a\u000aGris - Il etait un foret (some of the most sorrowful BM around)\u000a\u000aDeathspell Omega - Drought (very technical and weird)\u000a\u000aAbyssal - Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius (doomy and crushing, with some death metal thrown in)\u000a\u000aDragged Into Sunlight - Hatred for Mankind (a lot of death metal sound, but still awesome)\u000a\u000aHarakiri for the Sky - Self-titled (kind of a post-rock/BM blend)\u000a\u000aDweller in the Valley - Younger Dryas (an unknown gem)\u000a\u000aYellow Eyes - Hammer of Night (kind of odd and fascinating American BM)

But i am currently working on recording instrumentals i've written, some metal influenced, but again all acoustic or clean electric. I've got a couple more songs in this style though, will post them soon to this page.

p1708
aVWell i'd love to release a demo cd if possible, don't have enough material for a full album yet. But I would definetly be interested in a collab. You have a music page?

aVThank you, can you elaborate on that? Since the drums are sequenced there's always the issue of trying to make them sound more natural, especially with the lo fi aesthetic. I did some compression and EQ for that reason that made them fit better in the mix but may have reduced the impact.

p1780
aVYour awful guitar tone rules. Cool song.
p1781
aVThat's the Marshall MG for you.
p1782
aVI loved your clean intermission at ~1:40. Sounds a little like Jim Morrison, but you kept it distant and detached. It works great. \u000a\u000aWould have liked to see a bit of a tempo shift toward the end or the introduction of another layer for either variance or complexity, but it's a solid track.
p1783
aVVery good mix, all said. The tremolo riffing I found enjoyable, though I thought the transition near :52 was a tad wonky (?). Nothing wrong with that, I suppose. Some cool vocals sung cleanly and otherwise and etc. \u000aThe only beefy critique I have is what someone else here mentioned: vary the fills a bit more; for being such a slow tune, I'd say it left me unconvinced as to whether you could pull off a whole album in this style. But that's very easily manageable! \u000a\u000aThe mixing is the hardest, and you've got that down fairly well. \u000a\u000aPretty god dammed good for five hours!

aVYou should start with Metal: A Headbanger's Journey and Global Metal by Sam Dunn.\u000a\u000aFirst, there are the BM precursors : [Black Sabbath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUQA9wVNAN4), [Mercyful Fate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSaXd9UlRrY), [Venom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcl_BHBhhXM), [Bathory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFLj1WFJmMA),\u000aOld school thrash metal like [Celtic Frost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsEFZrzc458), [Bulldozer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7_2Dpss5w), [Kreator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9_2uq7Erm4), [Sodom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR_Fq9MYaXI), [Coroner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq_-GSq4Q8c), etc. aka the first wave of BM.\u000a\u000aThe huge influence retroactively : [Kraftwerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WT4bXfPZcc),  and the whole Krautrock scene heavily influenced the noise rock scene during the 70s and after that like [Neu!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQCTTvUqhOQ), [Faust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv_XdLfJaFg), etc. watch some docs about Krautrock and Moog if you want.\u000a\u000aThe 80s Batcave/Deathrock/Cold-New Wave/Goth, really important part of the theatre/folklore behind the BM: [Christian Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Rj1gINBYk), [Sister of Mercy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GwWra1sQgo), [Clan of Xymox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G-yZmf6o8A) (if you like Lustre and Ambiant BM), [The Cure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzFmlRCyVUs) (Carpathian Forest made [an excellent cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyBIzxRrvA)), [Virgin Prunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMMHf2mJV1g), etc.\u000a\u000aThe arch nemesis : Old School Death Metal : [Obituary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcptsZUEGnw) or anything by [Death](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2l9mciyQ-YfSpXPJ4mvkpE5GCvqU9yPB), really. Some people have more knowledge than me about this scene and should be able to link some of the best death metal albums of all time. Try /r/Deathmetal \u000a\u000aYou need to know your classics [Wagner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4Iuxy0X4I), [Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqZivUlWUGw), [Saint-Saens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM), [Dvo\u0159ák](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4-1RN8nIc),... if it's called "Requiem" or Dies Irae, as a BM fan, you should like it.\u000a\u000aI hope you'll find this list informative.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I forgot about the Punk/Hardcore Punk scene from the 80s (huge influence with their lo-fi, fast as hell songs, cheap production and instruments) : [The Misfits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XSQcBJmL0o), [Bad Brains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga5ZbMMZ6Hk), [Black Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om6ho37eSYE), etc.

aVwhats wrong with tolkien
p1833
aVCurrent 93, Lustmord and Coil if you're into the more esoteric, atmospheric sort of black metal.  Trouble are also fantastic, in spite or perhaps because of their being christian.  King Crimson and other psychadelic rock acts synergise pretty well.  I guess it really just depends on what it is you get out of black metal.  I like the kind of harsh, nihilistic brutality of it, but there's a romanticism at the heart of it too, even if it's in the form of the nostalgic nationalism of Peste Noire or Burzum.  \u000a\u000aEven as a niche genre, it is so diverse it's almost impossible to recommend you anything without knowing what specifically you're into.
p1834
aVI would say the BM i am into can be divided into two groups: First of all i like more "classic" stuff (i hate to use such an umbrella term but the correct classifications escape me) like Emperor, Darkthrone, Burzum, Mayhem, and the like. The second group of BM that i listen to is more blackgaze or NWOABM like Krallice, Deafheaven, Wolves in the Throne Room, ect. Hope that helps.
p1835
aVWhat do you mean by NWOABM?\u000a\u000aFunnily enough those are the two "types" of BM I listen to as well :P

aVDischarge's - Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing basically influenced everything that is extreme metal today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pfiLjL6-HI and Amebix - No Sanctuary they were also one of the first bands that mixed metal &amp; punk (crust punk) while starting around the same time venom did and sounding a bit alike https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvZHZlg6Q0M
p1839
aVI hate to be 'that guy' because I totally agree with you about Discharge and Amebix, but for the sake of clarity and to get younger people in to those bands and to see where you're coming from it might be better if you edit "Discharges" to "Discharge's".
p1840
aVListen to early Sarcofago. 
p1841
aVEverything Fenriz mentions in Black Metal University, I guess. It's on YouTube, and a good place to start for music that inspired the genre but isn't BM.
p1842
aV* [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9-5urh814s)\u000a* [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdyvXc_-M7U)\u000a\u000aIt's kind of an awkward lecture (evident through the difference in views from Part 1 to Part 2) but he covers the essentials. Know all of the bands he mentions (give or take a few) and you know more about Black Metal than 80% of the people introduced to it through the post/atmo/ambient varieties. You will also be able to appreciate and notice the influences in more modern acts.
p1843
aVCeltic Frost - Morbid Tales\u000a\u000aReleased 10 years before Black Metal become to fame yet I can hear almost direct influences from this album on early Mayhem recordings particularly. I think particularly influential to the genre.
p1844
aVSomewhat surprised it hasn't been mentioned yet: Black Sabbath's self-titled debut. Influential to every genre of metal, BM included.

aVchelsea wolfe-pain is beauty

aVWouldn't 'Apokalypsis' be more relevant to black metal with the low-fi sound and darker tone?
p1847
aVsure. i'm just enthralled by feral love is all. if low-fi and darkness is key how about some old delta blues? that shit is dark and lo-fi. i'm kidding but really i'm not.

p1851
aVHelloween's "Walls of Jericho". \u000a\u000aNow usually all power metal is sacrilege to most black metal fans but this album is one of the first PM albums out there and is raw, fast and aggressive with some Satanic tones woven in. A fantastic listen.

aVA Hard Day's Night 
p1858
aVI'm not sure about the rest of /r/BlackMetal but most of my black metal loving friends and I really enjoy good jazz. If it's moody and progressive it's going to hit the same sorts of feel good receptors that black metal does. Check out Todd Sickafoose, Gipsy Kings, etc. \u000aI also think that Goblin (circa 1970's) is a fantastic band that reminds me of a fusion between atmospheric black metal and Pink Floyd.

p1864
aVI think it's sort of a wanky term but I've heard it used to describe Agalloch before. Basically it's what isn't quite black metal but has black metal influences. 
p1865

aVYou might try Hellhammer, the early work of Sodom and Kreator, Absu, Nunslaughter, and the first Sepultura album. \u000a\u000aThe Norse (and Norse-inspired) wave of black metal in the 90s is kind of a different beast from Venom, but Bathory is the dominant influence on most of that music, which is really the canon of what we call black metal. Burzum, Darkthrone, Immortal, Emperor, Mayhem, Beherit, Gorgoroth, Enslaved. 
p1918
aVCeltic Frost, Triptykon, Sabbat (Japan), and Midnight are bands I would recommend given what you like.
p1919

p1967
aVAs far as LPs go it's been a pretty awesome year, especially for American Black Metal. Agolloch, Falls of Rauros, and Panopticon all had great releases. Woman is the Earth - Depths was also great, and was pretty much how I was hoping for Celestite to sound (and unfortunately it didn't.) The best recording I heard this year might honestly be [Nadra's demo](http://nadra.bandcamp.com/) though. Falid is probably my favorite metal track this year, in any genre.

Nothing good has really come out recently, except for the new Goatmoon. If you like Atmoblack, then I guess this is a good year. Nothing good in terms of legit BM though. I guess Black Metal is a dying genre, replaced by 'Blackgaze'.
p1978
aVDid you not hit the new Death Fortress, Primal, Nidsang, or Thy Darkened Shade? All solid (especially the Death Fortress) non-atmoblack, though as you mentioned there was a ton of good atmoblack. I haven't even been following black metal this year very closely (big death metal year for me) and I know that there are some good releases that I really liked. \u000a\u000aMaybe just start flicking through the Fallen Empire catalog? 
p1979
aVDeath Fortress is on my backlog, I'll check it out, thanks. I've heard the name Fallen Empire thrown around, so maybe I'll go through those. Thanks.
p1980
aVFallen Empire has a LOT of free downloads- including the new Death Fortress- and is basically just a bunch of underground black metal.\u000a\u000a\u000aNote: the fifth song on the new Death Fortress opens with one of my favorite riffs of 2014. So good.
p1981
aVYeah, I saw someone post a link to the new Death Fortress on /mu/ the other day, so I have it downloaded. I might listen to it tonight, but I have exams soon, so maybe not.
p1982
aVI saw that and thought it was hilarious that someone rehosted an album that's free to DL in the first place. \u000a\u000aWhat, you don't blast black metal while you study? I sure do- not as distracting as death metal and totally killer for that.

p2004
aVDepends if he can get from the UK in time for the show tonight because that's where he's stuck now. 
p2005
aVAh, really? I thought that issue was resolved and all the members were in the US now. 
p2006
aVAttila held it down well enough last night but I don't understand why the hell they had two guitarists instead of one dude playing bass. 
p2007
aVI was there last night, and I was up front for Watain. The "red liquid" was, in fact, pig's blood. It was salty and clotted in places. I got pretty soaked. \u000a\u000aAnd agreed, Mayhem was kinda boring after seeing what Watain put on. 
p2008
aVI can comfirm this. \u000aPig's blood leaves a mess. It's kind of hard to remove from the barricades and speakers. 
p2009
aVOne of those shows where the venue's security guys were definitely not psyched to be there.
p2010
aVThey actally brought their own security for that show. 
p2011
aViiiinteresting. I was talking to my buddy about how much it *costs* Watain to do a show with the crew they have. 
p2012
aVhow much does it?\u000a\u000aalso, for pig's blood, i'd try throwing some oxi-clean on it.  it's in most of the cleansers that kennels and vet offices use for cleaning up after animals.  it also really helps get the cat piss smell out of clothes when my cat has a uti.
p2013
aVOh I have absolutely no idea, but it's probably not cheap. And thanks for the tip! Luckily I was wearing a waterproof jacket, so it came off pretty easily, with the added benefit of making it look like I murdered someone in my shower. 
p2014
aVI just misread that as "bulletproof jacket" ...
p2015
aVwell what do you think i was wearing *under* the waterproof jacket? I got all the proofs, man
p2016
aVWell. They won't show up without a crew, so...
p2017
aVTotally agree. I went for Watain and was not disappointed. It was my first black metal show. :P
p2018
aVWas there last night. Mayhem and Watain both put on great shows but I would've liked more Lawless Darkness &amp; De Mysteriis. I think I'll forever be butthurt I didn't get to hear Four Thrones &amp; Funeral Fog.
p2019
aVHaving seen Watain live three times now, I think they were off of their game last night. They usually bring a serious amount of passion and energy to the stage, but last night they didn't. \u000a\u000aAs for the blood, they threw it into the audience exactly like they did it at Brooklyn Bazaar in June. Same music, same cues, same props. Back then, it was shocking and brutal, but last night it was just scripted. 
p2020
aVone of my friends saw rotten sound putting on their blood soaked butcher's clothes before a show.  they kept them in plastic garment bags.
p2021
aVI saw them in Baltimore on Friday, absolutely amazing show. Had a great time. Also Revenge was awesome!
p2022
aVI did too and was severely disappointed they didn't encore or play longer to fill some of the time meant for mayhem
p2023
aVHonestly I was just happy to see them and Revenge, I couldn't care less about Mayhem to be honest. I like them and all but atillas style is not for me I think it would be sick if they got someone like hoest from Taake. 
p2024
aVI disagree but regardless a Friday night show that ended at 1030 is ridiculous. I wanted to hear legions of the black light too 
p2025
aVMan they played an hour and twenty minute set. I couldn't ask much more, most black metal bands couldn't pull that off if they tried.
p2026
aVReally? It didnt feel that long. I guess its because they had so much energy til the end
p2027
aVI missed my flight on thursday to come home and see them in Philly, but I heard really mixed reviews.
p2028
aVRevenge absolutely crushed last night. Total violence. That new song was a ripper too. Riffs galore. \u000a\u000aThat said, I dug Watain's performance especially when they busted out "I Am the Earth". Erik's vocals also held up consistently through the set. 
p2029
aVAre you blowing black shit out of your nose? I've seen them twice and those candles are brutal. 
p2030
aVI'm going to try and make this show when it comes through.  I saw 1349 and felt the same way some of you do about Mayhem's performance.  They just seemed like they were going through the motions which bummed me out because I had been looking forward to setting them for years.  Mayhem was bsdass last time I saw them.
p2031
aVSeeing them later thid month. So excited.
p2032
aVI'm seeing them in Toronto on Tuesday, cannot wait!\u000a\u000aI listened to Watain's setlist online (the album versions obviously) and I'm really looking forward to them now
p2033
aVUhhh I'm struggling with not going to this show because it's about 6 hours away and money but damn that review really makes me want to.
p2034
aVIs Necrobutcher playing with Mayhem? I heard some issues about his visa. 
p2035
aVNo, Necro wasn't there on saturday. 
p2036
aVSeeing them in Lawrence. I hope Mayhem isn't as dull as what everyone is saying. I really liked Esoteric Warfare!

aVthis thread would be good if it weren't for the clowns hating on watain because they think they're overproduced or whatever. shouldn't you be lurking on the nwn forums? i went to the philly show and mayhem didn't play but revenge and watain both killed it.
p2039
aVwatain is kinda overproduced on record, but they're better live.  i still think their live drum sound is too clear though.\u000a\u000ai went because i like early mayhem, i thought current mayhem blew, and i walked out with newfound respect for watain.

p2061
(lp2062
VImages 1-9 are of the 7xLP box set of Deathspell Omega's later body of work. Seven picture discs, each emblazoned with the sumptuous artwork of each album/EP they have released since 2004. Contains a 60+ page "psalter" with the lyrics of each album in chronological order.\u000a\u000aImages 10-11 is the of the same artist, the EP-Kénôse, released 2005, contains a 30+ booklet of original artwork.\u000a\u000aImage 12 is "The Mantle" from Agalloch, An atmospheric, and deeply melancholy treasure, released in 2002.\u000a\u000aImages 13-15 comes from Murmuüre. This one-man project of a Frenchman calling himself "One," came out in 2010 in extremely limited releases. The album is filled with beautiful moments. Murmuure's melodies--if you can call them that--move with a logic that is totally their own, pulling the drums far beyond conventional time and rhythm, the album completely transcends formula, this is an exciting piece of music to have and behold!\u000a\u000aImages 16-17 are of the self titled LP from Lurker of Chalice. Depressive, and deeply twisted. If you like your music dark, I cannot recommend this album enough. A true underground gem from start to finish.\u000a\u000aImage 18 is the blood red vinyl edition of Leviathan's album- Massive Conspiracy Against All Life. A blazing torrent of distorted vocals and suicidal riffs, fueled by bad drugs and misanthropy. This album is simply the final nail in christ's coffin.\u000a\u000a19-20 are again from the Portland based dark metal outfit known as Agalloch. This is their album "Marrow of the Spirit" which came on clear grey vynil, released in 2010. Seeing them playing a live show, it is clear that they have a mastery of their sound. Truly talented musicians, and an essential listen for all types of music lovers.\u000a\u000aLastly, is the red-green split vinyl of Leviathans "The Blind Wound". Truly one of the shining moments of his extremely prolific musical career, spanning over 20 quality releases.\u000a\u000aI would have liked to show a little more variety from my collection, but these pics were already on my PC, and pulling them out is kind of a chore. \u000a\u000a\u000aSupport the artists that inspire you!\u000a\u000aCheers!

aVIs The Mantle the pressing from Grau? The End Records are repressing The Mantle and Ashes this year. 
p2064
aVIt is the grau pressing! I neglected to mention that, maybe because i wish i had the original pressing! So difficult to find.. so expensive. The sound quality is still really great. 
p2065
aVYeah I have it to, and I agree the sound quality is nice. I'm just glad that with the repressing I can own an official copy and not be out &gt; $300.

aVI'm so happy these guy's aren't Nazis anymore. One of my favorite songs by one of my favorite Black Metal bands.
p2089
aVI've seen them live in Lithuania last June, the audience there seemed unaware of this change.\u000aTheir performance was amazing though.
p2090
aVYeah, it's not highly publicized, and I'm sure they don't want to alienate their old NS fans (since that's a huge part of their fanbase).  Even in these Reddit comments we can see at least one poster who doesn't seem happy that they dropped the Nazi shtick.\u000a\u000aThere hasn't been any mention of it in the music press or anything, but the band basically confirmed it on their official facebook page.  I'm pretty sure the singer is still a racist dick, but that doesn't seem to be the band's official ideology anymore.

Pain is not strong enough word though. Torture would have the right nyance. ), [Jenni Vartiainen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lJJeG6rtzs), again lyrics are grim but... Then there is older songs like (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BXSkigN45w) wich basically tells about drinking and axe murdering the family (From the cold soil a cold eye stares, and the axe rises high; from between the mounds and the soils forfathers look proudly upon their sons: unemployment, booze, axe and the family. The cold snow, police and the last mistake) (. Or even older (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N-WWDvxiO0) It's all the same when you will die (because black roses are always blooming in tuonela (afterworld)) 
p2102

p2110
aVCool, thank you. I really enjoy the ColdWorld I've heard. Coincidentally I like the band Cold World. 
p2111
aVI am really enjoying Thränenkind. It's very on the shoegaze side but I really enjoy it's atmosphere. Almost a post-rock vibe. 
p2112
aVYeah, personally my favorite material form Thranenkind and Heretoir is the split they did together, I think its the best material either of them have done, definitely worth checking out. Glad you liked it.
p2113
aVSongs to Leave is great as well. Definitely a more raw version of Forgotten Tomb, but it is still Forgotten Tomb. Every single track on that album is fantastic. Love's Burial Ground is also good and absolutely worth checking out (Alone and House of Nostalgia are the best tracks). Negative Megalomania is alright, never got super into it. One good track on that album is I think called Blood and Concrete? \u000a\u000aTheir newest album, Saturn or Jupiter whatever the hell isn't that good  if you ask me.\u000a\u000aSpringtime Depression really is a flavor of Forgotten Tomb that they didn't recreate in any of their other albums though. That album seemed to use a lot higher fidelity in the recording, and was overall more "polished" than their other albums. Overall though, it's a tossup between Songs to Leave and Springtime Depression for my favorite Forgotten Tomb albums.
p2114
aVThanks, I'll definitely spend a little time with the ones you mentioned you enjoyed. Cliche as fuck, but back in June I was left by my lady of four years, and I really got in a dark place, and dove head first into albums like Springtime Depression. Got me threw some long nights. Feeling better now but that album still fucking rules. So melancholy. Best word to describe its atmosphere.
p2115
aVYeah man I hear you. Springtime Depression and Forgotten Tomb in general got me through some really, really dark times but I still listen to it pretty often nowadays. \u000a\u000aAnother great DSBM band is Abyssic Hate. The album Suicidal Emotions has to be my favorite DSBM album, but it is a bit lo-fi, which you say you aren't a huge fan of below. You might really like the band Dolorian. They're similar to Forgotten Tomb in that they're depressive black doom, but definitely a different take on that particular sub-genre. Hope you find some stuff you like.

aVIf anyone has a spotify playlist I could sub that would be cool. I have a pretty extensive black metal one but not a ton of dsbm on it. A lot of 2nd wave. And motherfucking Cor Scorpii

p2118
aVColdWorld, Lifelover, make a change...kill yourself, shining, leviathan. Nothing obscure. (Well, by our standards.) never could get into silencer or xasthur. But I only heard Xasthur tracks that were extremely lo-fi, and I have never been able to get into the verrrry lo-fi tracks

sVDoes Deathspell Omega use a drum machine?
p2200
(lp2201
VThe best speculation seems to be it's one drummer doing two or more drum tracks. It's definitely not one continuous drum recording, but DSO never gave specifics so it's impossible to know for sure.
p2202
aVI don't think they are programmed, but can anyone say for sure?\u000a\u000aedit: speaking of DsO, I really hope they put something out this year.
p2203
aVTheir last EP was released in 2012, so it can actually be a possibility. 
p2204
aVNo, seems far too human. There are 'sloppy' parts where, say, alternate blast beats start flamming and going out of sync etc. I doubt they would purposefully add human errors like that if they were going to use a drum machine.\u000a\u000aI'd say it's a human drummer, all done in separate takes and put together. Regardless, they're the fucking tits and since they're not a live band, it doesn't really matter either way at this stage.
p2205
aVYeah I totally would agree; I mean I'm listening to Si Monvmentvm right now and it either sounds like a human drummer or just about the most meticulous human-mimicking-purposefully-slightly-sloppy drum programming job that's ever been done. However, that's not completely unprecedented (see Eschaton by Anaal Nathrakh). But yeah if it hadn't been for that one part in 'The Crackled Book of Life' I'd have never doubted it was real drums. That part just sounds really drum-machiney to me.
p2206
aVFor comparison, see Sarcofago's use of a drum machine on the *Crust* EP for an example of extreme double bass that's programmed.
p2207
aVExactly, drum machines really stick out when it comes to double kick and/or blast beats, it's a dead give away. There are 'human' elements you can add like swing or some newer drum sample programs like Superior or Metal Foundry even have 'human' you can mix into it.\u000a\u000aWith that even you can still hear the mechanical precision and repetition of samples. Deathspell Omega do not contain anything similar to what I've heard any other bands with programmed drums. So either they're the full on masters of drum programming and put a ridiculous amount of effort into making it sound human, or they just recorded it live in studio, in parts most likely.\u000a\u000aTo be honest the speed of Deathspell Omega doesn't really warrant the need of a drum machine, anyway. Stamina for a live show would be tricky for songs like Chaining the Katechon, but for recording it wouldn't be too much of a problem. I know drummers that would be able to do it themselves in a studio situation.
p2208
aVDidn't Reaper have an algorithm, or something along those lines while ago, that had the ability to make drum tracks that were programs sound a little bit more human? It was basically like a sliding scale that slightly moved notes out of time to make them seem a little bit more human?
p2209
aVNot sure, never found anything like that. Wouldn't be surprised at all though, that program still amazes me, always finding new shit.
p2210
aVI wish I was a serious enough musician to actually understand it. I ran across that function in some YouTube video for Reaper about programming drums.
p2211
aV"Humanize" yeah. I've used that on drum tracks. It just randomizes the timing and the dynamics slightly. Sometimes it just makes things sound weird though.
p2212
aV[deleted]
p2213
aVPretty sure they use as a drum machine, but Mikko and/or Hasjarl rarely give interviews, so who's to say? 
p2214
aVYou're right. Those cymbals sound like DFH. There are lots of ways to humanize programmed drums. They might be tracking parts of it with triggers and using the samples in EZ Drummer or DFH and combining that with programmed parts. Conversely, DFH cymbals are mostly samples of Sabians, so maybe that's what we're hearing. I'll have to listen some more. Haven't paid much attention to these guys, but, strangely, this has my interest piqued. 
p2215
aVDefinitely not programmed. Hell, even Clandestine Blaze has real drums. As for unplayability, there are drummers of this caliber nowadays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axw0Z44zdv4
p2216
aVA far unsubstantiated theory I have is that they utilized Jamie Saint Merat from Ulcerate from Fas' onward. He talked briefly about shopping himself out to extreme metal compatriots in France specifically in a couple interview I read on him. Outside of that and speaking as a drummer, I think the biggest issue is mostly just endurance when approaching their compositions. Besides the tricky time signatures and such.
p2217
aVMikko is a goddamn machine, so yes.
p2218
aVno, they don't.  won't say who it is but its not programmed.  come on guys, drummers are REALLY good nowadays.  I could play all their stuff if I practiced it.
p2219
aVUm, I explicitly mentioned in my post that the reason I have doubts is *not* due to the difficulty of the parts.
p2220
aVoh, by all means, excuse me.\u000a\u000ait was more a response to this thread, as in why can't it be a continuous drum track?  that's how 99% of the drummers I know do it in studio.

aVAt that point in their lives, none of that stuff really matters. My wife and I still go to shows, leave our 16-month-old son with a babysitter, and we still find ourselves hitting merch tables and saying shit like, "Oh, that patch would look so cool on a shirt for him". I'm pretty sure that up until a certain age, having a baby is all about playing dress-up. And this is a guy who has a baby with an Altar of Plagues shirt, an Ulver shirt, and a Circle Takes the Square shirt (non-black metal). Until they get old enough to tell us, "Hey fuck you, Mom and Dad. This isn't me", we pretty much get to have as much fun with it as we can.

aVNo cheese. No ironic detachment. Frigid, vicious, bombastic black metal. 
p2391
aVThat's what I love about it. It may not sound like nightside eclipse (which isn't just my favorite symphonic black metal album but my favorite albu of all time), but it maintains the more aggressively, darker sound and atmosphere that record masters so beautifully.

aVIf I check what symphonic bands made my EOTY list, I come up with... Nightbringer's Ego Dominus Tuus was one of the standout releases of 2014 that might be right up your alley.

VSorry, but if you're trying to use Fallujah as an example of black metal fans being kvlt elitist assholes who hate sound quality, you're a bit off the mark. \u000a\u000a\u000aFallujah is some terrible technical deathcore band and is definitely pretty far from what black metal fans would listen to as far as acceptable music. Terrible bands have been incorporating black metal sounds for decades now, so I don't think a band like this would phase us. \u000a\u000a\u000aWe don't have a problem with good sound quality. We just don't need it to appreciate the music. 
p2417
aVNo, not trying to use fallujah in any example other than their sound quality. And i'm getting all the answers i'm looking for. Also there are no assumptions here about how elitist any of you are. \u000a
p2418
aVNo problem, dude. Plenty of people in shreddit love using straw man arguments for hating on "elitists" here to justify to themselves for not exploring new bands or new music. It's always nice to see metal fans out there that are not like that. 
p2419
aVWord! The silly thing about the elitists is that the bands they listen to probably pull inspiration from other bands. such a weird concept lol
p2420
aV"heavily influenced by black metal" isn't black metal.
p2421
aVIt was an overarching statement. More simply, production quality of fallujahs "Flesh Prevails", being in black metal.
p2422
aVI feel like Fallujah is far from a black metal band. Whether or not they are good is subjective and up to you.\u000a\u000aI think there is merit to both poorly produced lofi metal and well produced black metal. Production matters less to me than the music itself 
p2423
aVA short, simple and well put response. Thank you. This is what I was looking for. \u000a
p2424
aVI think it's important here to differentiate between "good" production and "smooth" production. For example, I think Tentacles of Whorror is really well produced, but the production is anything but smooth.\u000a\u000aI think that this sub draws the line at around the level of *The Satanist* by Behemoth - stuff like Fallujah isn't particularly black metal, but there's a bunch of black/death (Ascension, Aosoth, etc) posted here.
p2425
aVNo Fallujah is NOT black metal. They simply implement elements of the genre and I was using them to reference their quality of sound. Was trying to avoid using Behemoths "The Satanist" for an example so that the post didn't get flagged. Love that album though\u000a
p2426
aVI didn't think you were stating that Fallujah *were* black metal. However, I think it's still important to note that for black metal, the quality of production isn't necessarily linked directly a "nice" sound.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I think that there's some fantastic black metal out there with less kvlt-sounding but still great production: Blut Aus Nord's latest album springs to mind, as does recent Marduk and Altar of Plagues. On the other end of spectrum, there's Bone Awl, which sounds like it was recorded using a tin can and yet is some of the best raw black metal out there.\u000a\u000aedit: spelling
p2427
aVi dont even know what fallujah is.\u000aBut for me mastering and overall audio quality is really important. But we all know that there are masterpieces there were recorded in basement/garage/toilet and you know what? Good music will always be good music, 
p2428
aVagreed
p2429
aVI love a lot of different kinds of black metal, some lofi, some "over produced", and some with one mic shitty demo quality, but I also love other types of metal that rely on good production, like BTBAM or Opeth. I think low production quality, on purpose or not, adds to the abrasive manor of certain BM, like Darkthrone or Leviathan, while bands like Wolves in the throne room have higher quality, mostly because there is more layering going on.

(lp2476
VAs you asked for feedback:  \u000a1. The drums during the first part are monotonous and, hell, they run amok. Had this problem with double base, too, when using a drum computer :) perhaps you'll like to adjust that.  \u000a2. A bit more variety in the growls could add an extra touch. As an idea.  \u000aBesides that: nice approach! I like melody and riffs. Will buy this later when not on a mobile device, so despite 1. you see it was still worth listening ;)
p2477
aVThanks! I totally see where you're coming from on the drum parts, this is my first experience with programmed drums. I'll probably clean them up on the EP I'm planing. I have some other songs where I use some different type of growls, maybe I'll incorporate them more. \u000aI appreciate the feedback! 
p2478
aVThis is pretty good. It kind of reminds me of Nae'blis actually, which is great. What drum software are you using? Unrelated to the music, I don't really care for the logo too much. Would you consider a redesign (by me)?
p2479
aVThanks! I use the EzDrummer plugin with FL Studio. I dont like the logo either tbh, I just threw it together just to have a logo. Hmm, that depends! Do you have a link to other logos you've made, and do you have a fee?
p2480
aVGood song mate. \u000a\u000aThe only feedback that I have is on the drums. You are using a cheap computer drum machine and it sounds like it. Consider using drum software like battery 3, this would give you much better range of variability of how how each strike of the kit could sound. Also, your machine gun drum pattern could be beefed up a little bit. Consider running those parts through some compression, distortion, and delay.  \u000a\u000aCheers
p2481
aVIt is one man metal, though. Bad drum machine is sort of the name of the game.
p2482
aVHahaha, this is true.
p2483
aVI dug it,  I'd have to agree with others on the drums,  sounded pretty metallic and harsh, but still awesome riffs, sweeping guitars, vocals were pretty good.  Interesting lyrical choice with the Poe poem,  I like it. Keep it up!  \u005cm/
p2484
aVAFAIR EZdrummer has a built in humanizer function. Sounds like you've disabled it. If you put a little effort into mixing, EQing and effects, EZdrummer can sound pretty decent actually.\u000aVocals sound a bit too 'held back' for my taste, but they aren't bad.\u000a\u000aApart from that, I like the song quite a lot! Those riffs are pretty catchy (in a good, non-annoying way).

p2523
aVI don't get this bands appeal. I like Diocletian, I like Teitanblood, I like a ton of super grindy/noisy/gross/putrid/low-fi music. I just can't get into this band for some reason. Someone explain it to me, seriously. What am I missing?
p2524
aVIdk dude. Do you like Revenge? 
p2525
aVNot really. I think all this war metal stuff is just mixed so shitty that I can't hear the riffs.
p2526
aVWith Conqueror, it works largely because most of the time you CAN\u2019T hear the riffs. It\u2019s the sound of chaos: guitars, drums and vocals all in violent, lawless combat with one another. Waves of sound clashing together like three ill-defined armies in a war of all against all. But then, sometimes, one part will gain a temporary advantage\u2014a vocal couplet, the drums ceasing to blast for a few bars, a hook-ish guitar riff\u2014like the battle subsides for just a moment to watch as a legendary warrior utterly devastates an opponent in single combat.\u000a\u000aThat being said, there\u2019s an awful lot of terrible war metal. Like grindcore, it\u2019s easy to make and thus easy to make poorly. Especially by bands that don\u2019t take the time to understand how and why the music is composed the way it is and instead just imitate the superficialities (i.e. simple riffs, constant blasting, goats with bullet belts).\u000a
p2527
aVThis is an eloquent and thoughtful explanation. However, part of me still feels like, if the point is not to actually hear the riffs in a metal song, it's sort of fruitless. It reminds me of the Simpsons episode with this exchange:\u000a\u000aBar Patron: Sounds like she's hitting a baby with a cat.\u000a\u000aLisa: You have to listen to the notes she's not playing.\u000a\u000aBar Patron: I can do that at home.

VI think this is a good idea. I'm here for learning about new, obscure black metal bands, and I think many others are here for the same reason, not to see the stuff we've listened to years posted.\u000a\u000aEssentially, I see music subreddits as places for discovery and not places for repetition. 
p2558
aVglad you feel that way, that is this sub's intended purpose
p2559
aVGuilty of posting many of these bands many times, will take this into consideration
p2560
aVI do enjoy your posts though
p2561
aVThank you, glad you enjoy them, and I appreciate all the excellent comments as well, Cheers!
p2562
aVNobody gives a shit about Samael. If this list serves as dual purpose to inform the rookies about BM then surely Taake and Satanic Warmaster should be on that list. I mean Taake has been posted about 40 fucking times. \u000a\u000aOver the past year and a bit I've been chilling here I've noticed these bands get posted a lot and are big karma whores. If you want to go hogwild add these to the list: Drudkh, Watain, WiTTR, Peste Noire, Windir, Mgla, Leviathan, Paysage d'Hiver, Altar of Plagues,  Blut Aus Nord, Urfaust, Woods of Desolation, Darkspace and Xasthur\u000a\u000aCradle of Filth is so garbage they should just ban whoever posts it and leave it off the list.
p2563
aVif i were the sole mod things would be much harsher, but i'm not, so certain moderation procedures need to be followed. thanks for the input though.\u000a
p2564
aVTaake should be at the top of the fucking list, much as I love him.
p2565
aVTaake deserves to be on there, I agree.
p2566
aVWhile I think some of that list definitely fits a lot of it is ~10 upvote sort of stuff.
p2567
aVI couldn't agree more with you about Cradle of Filth. As for the rest, take it in steps. See this as the first phase.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, I make a motion to delete the Internet connection of anyone who posts CoF. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that they were covering Nickelback or vice versa.
p2568
aVYou must've made a typo, you put wittr on a list with bm bands.
p2569
aV&gt;be checking out a band/album\u000a\u000a&gt;good song catches attention\u000a\u000a&gt;think r/BlackMetal might enjoy\u000a\u000a&gt;SEARCH to see if song has been previously posted\u000a\u000a&gt;it hasn't? share to the brethren. \u000a\u000aIt's not rocket science and it should be common sense but this should help. Though, I'm selfishly sad to see Summoning go because there is no such thing as too much Summoning.
p2570
aVcommon sense ain't too common
p2571
aVGreat idea! Watain, maybe?
p2572
aVtheyre just below the threshold currently
p2573
aVGood
p2574
aVI think Shining only has 100,000 listeners because there are two bands with that name. 
p2575
aVi considered that and i find it unlikely that the other shining has over 20k listeners.\u000a
p2576
aV"Blackjazz" alone has 25,000 listeners. So, they absolutely do.
p2577
aV*shrug*\u000a\u000aclose enough.
p2578
aVI wonder how many of those "fans" think they are the same band. My guess, more than zero.
p2579
aV[deleted]
p2580
aVExpected to see Blut Aus Nord, Drudkh, and The Ruins of Beverast. This is a great idea, though! 
p2581
aVthey all have less than 100k listeners. i wanted to adhere to some kind of concrete rubric, and for now i am doing so
p2582
aVYeah, what I meant was that I expected them to be over that listen limit. The cap is a good rule of thumb. 
p2583
aVYou should ban Drudkh, it's on here often enough.
p2584
aVi'm trying to limit the arbitrariness of what is and isnt allowed, though i do share the sentiment
p2585
aVFair enough. \u000a\u000aI appreciate this anyway, more music subs need to enforce rules like this.
p2586
aV[It's time](http://www.last.fm/music/Wolves+in+the+Throne+Room?ac=wolves).  
p2587
aVBoom! Thank you.
p2588
aVI see Taake on here waaaay too much
p2589
aVfor now i'm going by the hard and fast &gt;100k listeners rule, but i may adjust that in the future
p2590
aVThats a good place to start!
p2591
aVcheers
p2592
aVThis is a good idea but I can't help but feel offended about a Darkthrone ban.
p2593
aVAgree 100% with this, full support.
p2594
aVArcturus has 124K listeners.
p2595
aVtrue. i must've forgotten that they were even a bm band at one point
p2596
aVThe truest of the Norwegian kings.
p2597
aVI think the blacklist is similar in vein to the /r/metal one. It's a great starting point for someone to take a trip down the dark path.
p2598
aVI support this.\u000a\u000aAlso, the inclusion of Alcest amuses me. \u000a\u000aedit: I wouldn't mind seeing Deathspell Omega added.
p2599
aVcant trust you slippery bastards. but as you're undoubtedly aware, they did play bm for a minute or two
p2600
aVI suppose that's a good enough reason. Perhaps then Deafheaven should be on there? \u000a\u000aI'm pretty sure Wikipedia lists them as a black metal band...and I'm pretty sure anyone with a functioning eyeball and a modem has heard of them by now. Probably twice.
p2601
aVi didnt want to dignify their existence. maybe at a later date someone will force my hand
p2602
aVThey're still under the threshold.
p2603
aVI find the inclusion of Alcest funny as well
p2604
aVthey used to play black metal and have been posted numerous times to circlejerk-levels of upvotes. ha ha ha.
p2605
aVMakes sense
p2606
aVWhat's so funny about it? They're frequently posted.
p2607
aV1. What about a "common" band, such as Drudkh, but a rare song?\u000a\u000a2. Regarding Marduk: If someone finds a live performance of "Baptism of Fire" with good sound quality, I want to hear it (the album version is slower and unexciting).  How could it get posted despite the blacklist?\u000a\u000a3. If the majority of people here don't want Mayhem stuff, why don't they downvote it instead of upvoting?\u000a\u000a4. I agree with blacklisting Cradle of Filth for obvious reasons.  Gorgoroth, Satyricon, Immortal, Dimmu Borgir, Enslaved, Behemoth and Dark Funeral are boring to listen to.
p2608
aVNot a mod, obviously, but here's my two cents on your first and third questions:\u000a\u000aQuestion 1: Drudkh isn't on the blacklist, so they can still be posted.  As for the deep cuts from a popular band part, nothing from a well-known band is really that obscure anymore as a result of the internet.  Because of YouTube, it's about as easy to find lesser-known tracks from the biggest bands as it is to find their most popular songs.  It's much more difficult to find a good obscure band.  Also, if deep cuts from popular bands were allowed, you'd just have "My Journey to the Stars" zooming to the top of the front page instead of "Dunkelheit."\u000a\u000aQuestion 3: Subreddits aren't necessarily democratic, and this is an effort by the mods to make this one closer to their ideal.  Also, in any subreddit with thousands of users, two groups generally emerge: people who contribute, and people who lurk and vote.  I don't think you'll see seventy unique users post content here even over a period as long as a month, but you'll see seventy people vote on a given well-known submission.  I think the mods would rather have this sub cater to people who actively participate, rather than to silent users who (I'm guessing) vote mainly on the basis of recognition.
p2609
aV&gt;Subreddits aren't necessarily democratic, and this is an effort by the mods to make this one closer to their ideal.\u000a\u000a[Considering the crap that results in radio with asking "what do the majority want to listen to?" instead of using a single radio DJ's vision and extensive collection](http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1mbcd8/table_i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything/), that's a very good point for a music subreddit.  In the parlance of that radio executive's AMA, the idea iis to make /r/BlackMetal be like having a bunch of DJs who bring you obscure stuff, not "the newest top hit that most people in this demographic want to listen to."  When it becomes focus-group, majority-rule, the result is music that nobody really likes.
p2610
aVThis is exactly my vision of the sub, thank you for putting it into words.
p2611
aV^ I'm glad to hear any pessimism I had about /r/BlackMetal devolving into an e621-style dramafest was unfounded.  There won't be a bunch of Mayhem and melodic shit to pick through now and that makes me happy.
p2612
aVwhat he said.
p2613
aValso, fuck drudkh for their nsbm ties.
p2614
aVIt has been two weeks, and the quality of posts has risen significantly.  Now I can stop seeing Ulver and Dimmu Borgir on here every fucking day.
p2615
aVI completely agree with this. It should help to limit any circle-jerking in the sub.
p2616
aVthat's the aim
p2617
aVI agree this is a good idea. I don't want to nod my head to releases I've already listened to, but want to find new music.\u000a\u000aI think Windir and Peste Noire should be added, too.
p2618
aVthey were considered but failed to meet the second of the two criteria.
p2619
aVAh, I don't use last.fm, but I've noticed that windir seems to float up quite a bit, and checked all time top posts and for which peste noire shows up twice in the top 50.
p2620
aVwhile it obviously doesn't give a 1:1 representation of global listening habits, it is the best tool i know of for estimating the popularity of any given band, which is why it was chosen.
p2621
aVWindir should be one this list 
p2622
aVNice. I don't come to reddit to see a bunch of bands I already listen to all the time. Glad you left Solefald off the list, because I will spam them all day long.
p2623
aVyea good luck with that
p2624
aVI hope you do. We need more bands like Solefald that deviate from the norm. 
p2625
aVPersonally, a few of the bands in the blackest list aren't quite 'obscure' enough to be excluded, in my opinion. Some Black Metallers haven't heard of stuff like Borknagar, Arcturus, Old Man's Child, Samael, Summoning and Shining.
p2626
aVI actually found Shining recently when looking for the other Shining, from Sweden. They're not black metal, but a jazz outfit that put out an album called Blackjazz, inspired by black metal. It's the guy who's been doing sax for Ihsahn. I haven't been able to get into it; just felt like talking about it.
p2627
aVthe 'some people haven't heard ____' argument holds no water in this context; each band has a listenership over 100k which is the only criterion that needs to be met other than the obvious one of being or having been a bm band.
p2628
aVPlus if people haven't heard it, they can just look at this list, and research on their own. I hadn't heard of Borknagar until about five minutes ago. =p
p2629
aVI am 100% for this. 
p2630
aVI support this 100%. 
p2631
aVGood idea. Not sure why people post these bands in the first place. Many great bands on the black list, but come on. Who isn't already overly familiar with them? The point of the subreddit, if I'm not mistaken, is not to say, "remember this one and this one and this one and this one? You know, the ones you've already heard? Look! I found more!" 
p2632
aVex. act. ly.
p2633
aVAwesome! WITTR has under 100k. Spam time! [/sarcasm]
p2634
aVGood. Dimmu Burger is banned.
p2635
aVGod damn. About fucking time. Too much garbage gets posted here, that list, the rule about lastfm listeners is perfect. I welcome this change with open arms. Hopefully some of the easymode posters will leave for brighter places. 
p2636
aVI agree with most of this list except for cradle, dimmu, dark funeral and agalloch.  I love agollach and dark funeral but I don't really think they fall into the blackest category.  Dimmu is Dimmu....
p2637
aVAlso add panopticon and nokturnal mortum.  And id be happy

aVTemnozor may be classified as NSBM (they were a key part of the BlazeBirth Hall scene), but I think [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMetal/comments/20y32h/temnozor_white_thunder_roars/) is technically folk metal, with few black elements other than raw production.
p2644
aV[deleted]
p2645
aVShouldn't Sodom be in the list?
p2646
aVShould Destruction?
p2647
aVWill there be (plans to make) another BM subreddit for the discussion of these bands, for those of us whose black metal palette is limited to the more well-known bands of the genre, or no?
p2648
aV[deleted]
p2649
aVI agree with the idea. I think the concept of a blacklist banning just songs sort of clashes with the whole reddit model - it makes it hard to talk about these bands. Darkthrone and Burzum really are classics.
p2650
aVyeah, but everyone has already heard them.  maybe a period of grace after a new album for that material?
p2651
aVCan something be done about the continued Mgla posts for karma whoring. Everybody knows of the band now so there is no need to see yet another track of theirs posted every other day. Don't get me wrong, Mgla are great; this is getting silly, however.
p2652
aVBelphegor probably needs to be added there.
p2653
aVBorknagar has over 100k listeners but watain and wolves in the throne room do not? That is crazy.  Hail I.C.S. Vortex!\u000a

aVI'm very glad for this, sick of everyone posting the same overrated band over and over again (not saying they aren't good). Thank you PenetratorHammer!

p2657

p2658
aVGood. 
p2659
aVI've never heard of Samael, why are they on the list (alternatively I'm just a false)?\u000a\u000aAny good?
p2660
aVThey started off in a [seemingly](http://youtu.be/hOEsiOwodTY) good direction, but then after their third album turned into this industrial inspired stuff. I remember [this song](http://youtu.be/AtlnsjVDV4c) was played constantly on Much Music in Canada in the mid 90s. I have no idea what they are doing now, but nobody posts it here.
p2661
aVWhat's wrong with a little Industrial thrown in? (Or is it like a really heavy Industrial influence?  Which is bad)\u000a\u000aEdit: I don't listen to much Samael for clarification
p2662
aVThere is nothing inherently wrong with it. I was just summarizing who they are to my knowledge. I can't see the people here being excited to post [this stuff](http://youtu.be/aMzWysnhr5c) is my point.
p2663
aVIf you want an example of good industrial metal, try Axis of Perdition. The Ichneumon Method is incredible. For bad, modern Samael.
p2664
aVWhat do you think of Aborym?
p2665
aVYou could google them and decide for yourself. 
p2666
aVSamael was in the first wave, and was one very early band (who would rise to fame on the scene) to adopt this genre. What further makes them something of an oddity is that they are far removed from the physical scenes where this development was mostly centered. \u000a\u000aTheir early stuff is very good if you like the raw, unpolished sound of someone taking a chainsaw to a barbed wire.\u000a\u000aI jest -- it's not that bad, but I've lost my taste for 1st wave BM. Samael is a quality band nonetheless, though.\u000a\u000aAs others have said, they spent the 90s and most of 2000s making industrial metal, but they have a recent album which goes back *towards* their BM roots... without actually reaching it. Their 2 most recent albums are really more... industrial metal, I suppose. Dark industrial metal, if that's an appropriate categorization. Not blackened, just... with traces of extreme metal in the sound.\u000a\u000aI like industrial metal as well as various genres of black metal, so in my book Samael is 10/10.
p2667
aVI had never heard of them before, either.  They're on the list because they have more than one hundred thousand listeners on Last.fm.  I'm guessing they're pretty bad.
p2668
aVInquisition, bro
p2669
aVThey have like 32k listeners.
p2670
aVIf you've never heard of them, you should give "Ominous Doctrines of the Perpetual Mystical Macrocosm" a listen.  Inquisition is heavy as fuck.  \u005cm/
p2671
aVBut what about if a band for example like Cradle of Filth has a rare fucking demo tape that fell in the unknown obscurity of history. Would that be okay to show? Or refer to list and NO.

aVisn't black metal
p2675
aVSo you can present to me evidence that the first 3 Venom records didn't feature satanic lyrics, blast beats and gutteral vocals? Didn't think so. Go listen to Burzum you hipster. Posers like you are killing Black Metal. 
p2676
aVha ha ha. \u000a\u000aimplying lyrics define genre\u000a\u000aimplying "gutteral" vocals are a defining characteristic of bm\u000a\u000aimplying i haven't forgotten more black metal than you'll ever know\u000a\u000awhat i'm most baffled by though is where you heard blast beats in venom. \u000a\u000ado go on.
p2677
aV...wow....just....wow.
p2678
aV&gt; implying lyrics define genre \u000a&gt;\u000a&gt; implying "gutteral" vocals are a defining characteristic of bm\u000a\u000aLook up. In the sky. See that? It's the big picture flying over your head.\u000a\u000a
p2679
aVAnd what's your point, my trite little friend? That because Venom are generally recognized as one of the main founders of black metal by virtue of their coining the term, that they should be grandfathered into the genre, despite the fact that they play NWOBHM/speed metal? \u000a\u000aNot on my watch, bud!
p2680
aV&gt; That because Venom are generally recognized as one of the main \u000a&gt; founders of black metal by virtue of their coining the term, that they should be grandfathered into the genre, despite the fact that they play NWOBHM/speed metal? \u000a\u000aDo you mock me, sir?\u000a\u000aYou were doing so well up until that last clause. Most ironic is you sound too clever to be restrained by narrow-minded genre snobbery better left to mallcore kiddies. You'd probably say Black Sabbath weren't metal, either.\u000a\u000aIn any event, yes. You stated my argument all on your own and saved me the trouble. How can I not upvote?
p2681
aVNarrow-minded? Quite the opposite; I put a lot of thought into how best to classify bands. \u000a\u000aNow, Venom were one of the very first metal bands with an over-the-top Satanic image, which without question influenced many, many later black metal bands. But, they play NWOBHM/speed metal, and they happen to sing about Satan and such. However, lyrical content does not determine genre. \u000a\u000aMany people seem to labor under the same delusion regarding Mercyful Fate, a heavy metal band also with a strong Satanic aesthetic. Nor does KD's popularization of corpse paint qualify MF as a black metal band.\u000a\u000aIn each case, if the instrumentals remained identical, but the lyrical and aesthetic content were changed, say to fantasy or sci-fi or take-your-pick, no one would regard them as black metal. However, if we applied similar changes to say, *Under the Sign of the Black Mark* no one could make an argument against its still being a black metal record. \u000a\u000aAnd regarding the Black Sabbath comment, don't be obtuse. 
p2682
aV[deleted]
p2683
aVO, King of the Backhanded Retort:\u000a\u000aLyrical content does not define genre. Aesthetic does, of which lyrics are a part. In that sense, Venom are most definitely black metal, even if "nominally." Otherwise, by your definition, Dead-era Mayhem is not black metal either, nor are the MC5 punk.\u000a\u000aMetal genre, to me, is not determined by examining riffs. It's fluid and depends on context. If I were hanging out with friends and said, "Hey, put on some black metal" and they threw on Venom, I'd probably have to adjust my expectations. It's not the sound that comes to mind when I think of bm. However, in the historical context of this list, yes, they're definitely black metal, sire.
p2684
aVUmm pretty sure Venom didn't use blast beats...
p2685
aV&gt;Go listen to Burzum you hipster.\u000a\u000aThe fuck?
p2686
aVYeh, was gonna ask why Venom wasn't on that list.
p2687
aVWould love to never see Wolves in the throne room, blut aus nord, alcest, altar of plagues and all other "shoegaze"/post black metal bullshit in this sub anymore. Also anyone that posts deafheavens should probably be banned...
p2688
aVI think that Endless Dismal Moan, Sigh, Silencer, Black Funeral, Kroda, Mgla, Nihill, and Xasthur are all great Black Metal bands. I know they're not on the top of everyones lists but I believe they deserve recognition. I can list many many more black metal bands too if anyone wants to know some more.
p2689
aVwhat
p2690
aV[deleted]
p2691
aVSigh, Silencer and Xasthur are pretty well known. And do you mean Dark Funeral?
p2692
aVI meant Black Funeral haha. I know Dark Funeral but I'm not really a fan of them
p2693
aVWhat? Silencer are well known? That's it, I officially dislike them and dub them posers.\u000a\u000aBut seriously, it's nice to see them described that way. I remember back when "Death - Pierce Me" first came out and my friends and I had a phase with it. Good old days.
p2694
aVIn terms of "arguably black metal stuff that's popular on here regardless of genre" I think Deafheaven should be added. However, they're only at 83k fans... is that the only guideline being used here?
p2695
aVfor now yes. i want there to be a concrete criterion so that a band's exclusion is based in some kind of objectivity and not just individual capriciousness. 
p2696
aVThe hundred thousand listener guideline only applies to black metal bands.  My understanding is that bands that do not play black metal (e.g. Deafheaven) are banned regardless of listener count.
p2697
aVIf the list only applies to BM then why is Agalloch on it?\u000a\u000a
p2698
aVagalloch has been posted several times before, and a shocking number of people continue to labor under the delusion that they are, in part at least, a bm band. their inclusion in the list serves to disabuse unequivocally those lost souls of that notion.
p2699
aVhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMetal/search?q=agalloch&amp;restrict_sr=on
p2700
aVGood question.
p2701
aVhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMetal/search?q=agalloch&amp;restrict_sr=on
p2702
aVIf you sort the results by "new" it shows that the last time an Agalloch song was posted was two weeks ago, and three months before that.
p2703
aVand watch as that two weeks stretches into two months, and then two years!
p2704
aVWell, at least after May.
p2705
aVi may disallow them from here on out unless the new single was wholly unrepresentative of the rest of the album.

aVThis is a great idea. It's incredibly time wasting for me having all this stuff showing up on my front page. If it's on the Wikipedia page for 'Black Metal', then it definitely doesn't need to be here.

p2715
aVI don't see anything that I missed in the post... None of the bands I mentioned are in there, as far as I know. And my bad.
p2716
aVFrom the first paragraph:\u000a\u000a&gt;The deciding factors are two, and they are as simple as can be: if it's a black metal band and it has more than 100,000 listeners on last.fm...
p2717
aVNot true at all. Black metal is typically underground, and by no means must be that popular to be considered black metal.
p2718
aVMan, your reading comprehension skills are not very developed at all are they? These are the qualifying criteria I've established for blacklisted bands, present and future:\u000a\u000a1. The band is, in fact, a black metal band.\u000a\u000a2. Said band has a listenership on www.last.fm of 100,000 or greater.\u000a\u000aGet it?

p2747
aVYeah definitely. My favorite was the last track. It's angsty in a way, but it was derived from a 90's midwest-emo shoegaze feel, so the screaming is not meant to drone but to sound like he's being tortured by his own mind... Pretty spacey concept but trust me their energy on stage just touches your soul and opens your mind in a way that not a whole lot of performers can achieve.

aVfrom The Flenser's [pre-order page](http://store.theflenser.com/product/mastery-valis-lp-pre-sale):\u000a\u000a&gt; Valis is the first proper Mastery full-length and the most extreme record The Flenser has ever released. As its name and sigil demands, Mastery is a vessel to ascend the partial mind; one impulsive and chaotic, the other of collected illumination. A meditation unto the will subconscious. The solo black metal entity is the product of mastermind Ephemeral Domignostika (Pale Chalice, Pandiscordian Necrogenesis, Horn of Dagoth). Once a follower in the tradition of fellow Bay Area acts Leviathan, Crebain and Weakling, Mastery has evolved into something more. Valis is like a form of free jazz black metal\u2014twisted and complex, with upwards of 100 riffs per song. Eschewing traditional songwriting and conceptual forms, Domignostika creates through spontaneous composition, cut ups and free performance. His extremely unique guitar style, polyrhythmic drum patterns and urgent vocal delivery bely the fact that Valis is the work of one person playing everything with the utmost intentionality. Mastery has previously released five extremely limited (and long sold out) demos since 2004, a collection on the tUMULt label in 2011 titled Barbaric Usurpation of the Hypereonic Black Metal Throne, and split albums with with Skullflower and Palace of Worms. \u201cOne can only assume that Mastery mastermind Ephemeral Domignostika is an extremely dangerous career sociopath after being subjected to this spastic sonic evisceration; either that or a deeply disturbed black metal savant.\u201d \u2014That\u2019s How Kids Die \u201cMastery is total berzerker black metal, rooted in the tradition of true grim blackness, but filtered through Mastery\u2019s cracked perception, transforming this into something beyond true; a droned out and damaged, outsider blackness, that sounds pretty much unlike almost any other black metal.\u201d \u2014Aquarius\u000a\u000astrictly limited to a kvlt 250 records.

asVWhat did Quorthon think of the Norwegian BM Scene?
p2920
(lp2921
VIn the last interview of Quorthon that I could find, he says this.  While it's not so explicit, I don't think he was really paying attention to a lot of the scene itself as much as fans' reactions to him and his work.\u000a\u000a&gt; CROMCarl: It would have been, yeah. I guess that leads me to the next thing: how do you feel about the bands that almost sound identical to early Bathory, the Norwegian stuff that\u2019s been coming out for a while? It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re a direct influence into it, as far as musically. How do you feel about that whole situation in general?\u000a\u000a&gt;Quorthon: Well, I don\u2019t know what kinda piece shit music to be influenced by, cause, you know, I mean, the first 3 or 4 Bathory albums, you know, they\u2019re not even listenable. I mean, we\u2019re terrible musicians, we didn\u2019t have a clue, uuhhm, our English was fucked up, still is probably. But I mean, listen to even the first couple Bathory albums, the first Slayer albums; the first album of Celtic Frost, and the first album of Bathory\u2014it\u2019s all crap. But, I mean, it fitted in with certain, you know, it filled the gap, and a lot of people out there in the underground scene during the early 80s felt: \u201cWell, this is our music.\u201d They felt, you know, sorta like estranged from Saxon, Iron Maiden, and Van Halen, and all of those other bands. So this is a new kind of music formula, or metal formula, and, I mean, when we started, all of us, I mean, I\u2019m not just talking about Bathory, there were no such things as double bass drums and, you know, just the way we sounded when we would sing our material, I mean, that particular black metal vocals, we had to learn all that all ourselves when black metal was formed. I mean, today, when they grow up, I mean, kids in the age of 14-15, you know, they\u2019re experts playing double bass drums\u2014they can play as fast as they want. But in those days, there were no such thing around. The first time I ever in my entire life heard double bass drums was Motorhead \u201cOverkill\u201d, and by that time, I thought that was the fastest thing I\u2019ve heard in my entire life. All of the songs basically on the first album of Bathory is twice as fast as \u201cOverkill\u201d, and today we hear stuff that is so incredibly fast you cannot believe how fast these kids can play. Of course, if copying or being influenced by, it\u2019s flattering in one way, and it\u2019s also a reassurance that, you know, black metal will continue, because it does fill a certain gap: you need the extreme in order to get perspective on a lot of other things. I mean, if you can have all these crossover combinations, you know, with alternative pop, and, you know, vegetarian lesbian military front whatever kinda shit pigshit music right now they\u2019re playing and calling it \u201cmetal.\u201d It\u2019s good, I mean, a lot of people are buying all these records, and some people refer to it as \u201cmetal\u201d, whereas the kids, you know, they walk up on stage in these checkered shirts and, you know, eating a carrot, a saying \u201cviva la religion\u201d, and stuff like that, and people saying, I mean, people who are not into metal, they will not take it as metal, but it\u2019s still metal. I mean, it\u2019s heavy guitar-based music, which is good. \u000a\u000a&gt; CROMCarl: Right.\u000a\u000a&gt;Quorthon: Black Metal is a part of that. It\u2019s a very extreme image and all of that, but, uhm, we all go through a certain stage in our life, when we have green hair or safety pins, or studded black leather underwear or whatever (laughs)\u000a\u000ahttp://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=77468

p2934
(lp2935
VI have the backstory. \u000a\u000aIt has absolutely nothing to do with the Dragonforce article. That's practically ancient history at this point. Phil McSorley from Cobalt and Mike Meacham from Loss were pissed off about Kim's Caïna interview because Andy talked about feminism. Phil from Cobalt took umbrage at this and started calling Andy from Caïna, a "faggot", a "pussy", a "homo", and a "weak little bitch" on Caïna's facebook page. Soon afterwards, he turned his ire on Kim (despite the fact that she was Cobalt's merch girl and published the only interview with his new project, Recluse) and said on Recluse's page "Kim Kelly and the rest of the USBM friendship scene can suck our fucking cocks. No love, no faggot jean vest friends. We aren't friends." Mike Meacham jumped in and talked some shit on his personal page too. Then they deleted their posts like the "trve kvlt badasses" they are. Most in the community have come out in support of her including Erik from Cobalt saying that Phil doesn't speak for the band and how tasteless and ridiculous Phil's post was. It's mega-disappointing to see people with great lyric writing skills come off like high school jock douchebags to say the least. Every metal musician and journalist I know who has weighed in on this thinks these dudes are just assholes.\u000a\u000aEdit: Downvote all you want but that's the actual story. 
p2936
aVNot saying I don't believe you but do you have any links? If any of that stuff is still up at least...
p2937
aVKim's twitter and fb page are private. \u000a\u000aHere's Caïna's fb page where one of Phil's comments is still there on their December 11th post: https://www.facebook.com/cainaband\u000a\u000aMcSorley and Meacham deleted their statuses which explicitly call her out by name. I have screenshots of the statuses but I'd prefer not to post them as they come from Kim's page. I quoted the Recluse post verbatim in my previous post. Meacham's is just something along the lines of "Screw feminism and Kim for bringing it up". \u000a\u000aHere's Mutilation Rites actually discussing it in their set last night: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIXOsOIKVBE\u000a\u000a
p2938
aVI heard McSorley went kinda crazy. Maybe this is the manifestation of that. Seems like he's upset that black metal bands are talking the talk but aren't walking the walk, but this happens to literally every genre of music as it expands. I don't really know where I stand on that, but it's always better not to be a dickbag to the people that are responsible for spreading the word about your music.\u000a\u000a
p2939
aVI get wanting to return to a certain musical quality but he's basically trolling people on facebook who don't meet his standards of masculinity which makes him way less of an LLN-esque kvlt warrior and more of a majorly insecure high school jock picking on kids he knows won't fight back. And Meacham just can't stand that someone with a vagina has an opinion on extreme metal. By all accounts, the rest of their bands, Cobalt and Loss respectively, are great people and artists and don't share their bandmates' noxious views. There's rumors that the war fucked Phil up and I hope he gets help if that's the case (maybe help isn't "manly" enough for him) but that's no excuse for his actions.\u000a\u000aI think what's funnier is all of the musicians talking about their own falling out with Phil and/or Mike. Basically all comes down to, "There's only so much caricatures of Jews from the 30s and boasts about "killing towelheads" that I can take before saying goodbye." Ex-Cobalt live members, Aesop from Agalloch, Stavros from The Atlas Moth and more. If these guys wanted to isolate themselves, well, they've done that but they've also become a sad joke.\u000a\u000aHonestly, Recluse should just change their name to Insecure. Certainly a better reflection of the real driving force behind them.\u000a\u000a
p2940
aVWow, thats some lame shit. Thanks for the links. 
p2941
aVThat puts Cobalt briefly dissolving earlier this year in a new light, as McSorley hasn't seemed that insufferable before in interview settings and I'm sure Wunder puts up with a lot of shit.\u000a\u000a^^^^^Slow ^^^^^Forever ^^^^^when?
p2942
aVWhelp, Phil is officially kicked out of the band. Wunder is entering the studio in June 2015 for Slow Forever. \u000a\u000aPhil's response: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B4_JyutIYAAieoW.jpg\u000a\u000aClassy....\u000a\u000aI'll miss his Gonzo writing style and vocal work but this dude has basically done everything short of threatening Wunder with bodily harm to get himself kicked out of Cobalt. You can talk about how black metal has personalities with anti-social, unsavory views, but it's Wunder's right to not want to be associated with someone so blatantly bigoted because it's affecting his art. 
p2943
aVHoly shit\u2026\u000a\u000aI hope Wunder can handle the vocals on his own - he only did harsh vocals on part of one cobalt song, but he's a great clean singer. 
p2944
aVShe often mentions sexism in metal, which in turn, brings out all of the sexists to mention her.
p2945
aVEDIT IM WRONG I think the bulk of it is around [this](http://noisey.vice.com/blog/dragonforce-demoniac-interview) article. She discovered that members of Dragonforce used to have a band called Demoniac that made violent, homophobic and racist songs when they were teenagers. It was pretty ridiculous that someone who covers a genre that's rife with violent imagery and has an entire sub-genre based around racism would try and come down on them so hard for a silly thing they did when they were immature little kids. The entire interview was just them saying "well yeah those songs were pretty bad but we were just dumb teenagers trying to be edgy as possible" and Grim Kim responding with "YEAH BUT IT WAS SO BAD! HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY THIS?!"
p2946
aVWhich is funny considering she worked with Anal Cunt to promote an album.  Because they don't write *anything* that could be construed as racist or homophobic in any way.
p2947
aVAC was an obvious parody act though. They probably didn't believe in what they wrote. Not sure about Demoniac.
p2948
aVYeah, I understand. And from what I've heard she addressed her work with Anal Cunt and said basically, yeah that was dumb, I regret it.  Which is basically what the guys from DragonForce or whatever said I guess.  To both of which I say, OK, no big deal.  I just think people need to lighten up a bit.  I mean, I know we're not talking about Georgia O'Keefe or anything, but isn't art supposed to be controversial?
p2949
aVI don't know, I disagree. There's a huge difference between the fantasy violence that 99.9999% of the bands singing about will never actually act on and the all too real and all too prevalent problem of racism. \u000a\u000aAlso Dragonforce sucks, so who cares if somebody gives them a hard time for being shitty dudes?
p2950
aVTrue on both counts - there's a difference between horror movie stuff and things that actually happen in real life, and Dragonforce sucks. Still, the article read like Kim was trying way too hard to gotcha them on something that doesn't really matter. I don't think any of the accused members would ever write those songs as adults or that there was any sincerity to the lyrics, and everyone's done shitty things when they were teenagers.\u000a\u000aAlso, some of the questions just seemed useless as actual interview questions. "So do you think that offensive art still has value even if it upsets people?" as a black metal journalist is like a gourmet chef asking "do you think processed food is bad" or something - it's just a silly question. "Alright. So as far as the lyrics go, there\u2019s no \u201cNiggerslut Pt. II\u201d on the new record, right? You guys are behaving?" - They've never released an offensive song as Dragonforce, so of course there isn't. "I guess you missed out on all that. It\u2019s funny, you have a song talking about how much you hate immigrants, and you immigrated." - doesn't that just prove their point that those lyrics were clearly just SO EDGY bullshit and not at all reflective of their true beliefs?\u000a\u000aIt'd be one thing if she was just writing an article to say "hey check out what these guys used to be into" - I'd still think it's pointless though - but the fact that it's an actual interview with all these non-questions makes it come across like holier-than-thou scolding over something they did as kids 15 years ago.
p2951
aVI will never criticize somebody for calling out weak shit like racism or sexism, even if the attempt was a little tryhard. 
p2952
aVI mean, it's one thing to call out somebody being a racist and another to harass a current band- who probably thought that the interview was going to be about their upcoming album (wasn't out yet at the time) and then get harassed about age-old long-dead stuff. 
p2953
aVYeah, it certainly could've been more timely or relevant. I guess I'm more blown away that anybody would consider the Caina interview 'offensive' than the Dragonforce one. McSorley and Meacham are definitely doing more to damage the integrity of black metal than Dragonforce, no doubt. I doubt most black metal fans give a semblance of a fuck what Dragonforce says or does.
p2954
aVFirst: They were just joking around. Immature children. You can't really compare that to anything at that point. Just teenager Metal-fans trying to be edgy.\u000a\u000aSecond: \u000a\u000a&gt; Also Dragonforce sucks, so who cares if somebody gives them a hard time for being shitty dudes?\u000a\u000aThat's irrelevant. 
p2955
aVI think you're right, but I also think that people who don't 'mean' the racist shit they say, be it 'as a joke' or 'because they didn't know any better and were kids' or whatever, still normalize that kind of thing, and help make a safer climate for idiots who actually really get behind it to speak their mind, you know? People who don't necessarily consider themselves racist still give racism a place to fester when they do that shit, and calling it out seems admirable to me. Black metal is bigger than race, it's bigger than humanity. I don't want to let idiots demean it by trying to make it their white males only club. 
p2956
aVShe has good taste, but she often comes across as being intentionally PC.
p2957
aVI would say mixed taste, since she's not very discriminating at all.  She likes some good stuff but then spends a lot of time promoting Brooklyn "modern black metal" garbage like Krallice.
p2958
aVJust because you don't like Krallice doesn't make it garbage. You're kind of just being an example of what OP is talking about.
p2959
aVSure, that's fair, but it is garbage regardless of him liking it or not.
p2960
aVNo, it is garbage.  Like a lot of other "modern black metal"/USBM bands they substitute "atmosphere" and marketing for riffs and songwriting, only they add tech wankery into the mix as well.  I'm an example of someone having an issue with her?  Sure, but I don't see why that's a problem.  I explained why, and it has nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman and everything to do with what she chooses to support.
p2961
aVOh, so all of a a sudden taste in music isn't subjective, huh? It may be garbage to you, but that doesn't make it garbage to the rest of the bloody world.
p2962
aVSome of us *like* atmosphere and pretentious wankery. Personally, I'm into synth-wank bands like Summoning, Nazgul, and Caladan Brood, but I can understand liking tech-wank or post-metal.
p2963
aVI dont understand what's wrong with "atmosphere". I disagree that they lack songwriting, I think they write some really compelling, interesting stuff. I don't know where you get the marketing thing. They're on small labels and self released their last album. You're not an example of sexism, just one of someone who thinks their own  subjective opinion is objective fact and feels the need to slander what they don't understand.
p2964
aV&gt; feels the need to slander what they don't understand.\u000a\u000aNice job coming across as super pretentious m8. Really did a good job pulling it together by ending with that. 
p2965
aVI have heard three out of however many records they have and I have seen them live, so I think I understand their gimmick well enough.  I re-read the OP's original post and found nothing in there about people who "feel the need to slander what they don't understand," so now I'm confused as to how I'm supposed to be an example of what they're talking about.  Re: opinions versus facts, all genres have rules and defining characteristics, and if they're to be judged as a black metal band, they fail - no hatred, no aggression, might as well be listening to a Phish album.
p2966
aVI guess I forgot I was in r/blackmetal, where not wearing face paint is a gimmick. Thanks for reminding me I should unsubscribe.
p2967
aVYep, probably!
p2968
aVWe should carve out our own space of actual metal here.
p2969
aVPlease head on over to /r/Blackgaze instead. Your tastes will fit in better there. Be sure to bring your Starbucks coffee and marijuana.
p2970
aVHey now, you leave marijuana out of this. It's done nothing wrong!
p2971
aVWhen you're as public and write for publications on a scale like that, you can't exactly get away with casually supporting bands that might be racists. You either take a stand and hold onto it or watch the comment section devolve into calling you a hypocrite and so forth. Kim's consistent, especially in a community that typically shrugs at these things.
p2972
aVShe sounds like the type that frequents Tumblr and complains about being oppressed by... Everything.\u000a\u000aCould be wrong, but she sounds like a SJW with  a studded belt on.
p2973
aVYou are but she did tell me that your comment made her laugh. 
p2974
aVI think she had a column or a site that got upended recently, but I could be wrong...ive always enjoyed her taste. 
p2975
aVI remember when she was a DJ on Drexel's college radio station. She mostly played sludge and doom stuff. Never mentioned why. She also was pretty good with requests and would play metalcore and other types of metal if you messaged her.
p2976
aVIt's about the political correctness, and the 'FUCK YOU!' responses she gives to people who disagree with her. Besides that I have no idea why anyone would dislike her, she seems like a very nice and pleasant person judging by her writing.

All she's doing by associating with scum like that is cheapening metal.

p2991
aVactually i wasn't attacking her as a person but rather just making fun of your hyper stereotypical "PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON METAL THAN I DO THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE" attitude hth
p2992
aVWell then make a constructive argument regarding that instead of relying on absurdist arguments.

aVPlease make a constructive argument regarding my post instead of relying on fallacious Ad Hominem attacks on my username (before you actually bother doing this I will point out that I am once again Using Jokes To Make A Point)
p2996
aVWell, since your posts thus far have been utterly devoid of any substantive content, there's not much else to say about you other than to use your simple, superficial username in adduction to your vapidity. Once you say something that isn't in reference to a meme or some other reddit meta-narrative maybe there'll be something more to say.

The incident happened on the eastern side of [Kholat Syakhl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kholat_Syakhl), whose name in [Mansi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansi_language) means "Mountain of the Dead." Since then, the mountain pass where the incident occurred is called Dyatlov Pass, based on the name of the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov.\u000a\u000a&gt;The absence of witnesses and the subsequent investigations concerning the death of skiers inspired intense speculation. Investigators determined that the skiers tore their tent inside out, fleeing on foot under heavy snowfall. Although the bodies show no signs of struggle, two victims had fractured skulls and two broken ribs. Soviet authorities determined that an "unknown compelling force" had caused the deaths; access to the region was consequently blocked for hikers and adventurers for three years after the incident. Due to the lack of survivors, the chronology of events remains uncertain.\u000a\u000a&gt;====\u000a\u000a&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/61D3qDm.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Russia_edcp_relief_location_map.jpg) - *Location of Dyatlov Pass, Russia*\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a^Interesting: [^Devil's ^Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Pass) ^| [^Gemma ^Atkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemma_Atkinson) ^| [^Lozva ^River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozva_River) ^| [^Men ^in ^Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black) \u000a\u000a^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnnh8o9) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnnh8o9)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

p3158
aV100% agree. Teethed Glory and Injury is one of those albums I really can't imagine living without. Even though I got into AoP around the time of White Tomb, TGaI is really the album that set them so far ahead of the pack for me. One of my top 10 bands of all time, for sure.

p3167
aVWow, yeah there are many essential listens but they will vary a lot depending on who you ask. In my opinion, most people getting into the genre seem to enter phases much like the progression of black metal "waves". Pretty much everything 2nd wave and norwegian is essential listening. Mayhem albums up until Declaration of War, Satyricon's albums up until Now, Diabolical... Darkthrone's albums up until metal hiking punks, Burzum's albums up until prison, Emperors albums, etc. Then from their most people go backwards and look at what was first wave. Bathory, etc. Then move on through the years to discover Watain, Secrets of the Moon, Deathspell Omega, Xasthur, etc. If you are interested in hearing what I consider the best released on spotify from last year, check out my top ten albums playlist here: https://play.spotify.com/user/1275803544/playlist/5nxn3VpDWqP3El4823nqmU \u000a\u000aAfter you hear enough albums you will find your favorite corner of black metal.

p3227
aVGlad you enjoyed it. I didn't know Posh Isolation put out metal either, and I follow them relatively closely. This seems to be a first, possibly because Slægt is Danish? It's hard to say, but I'm into a lot of the stuff from both labels involved. Also, I'm glad you enjoy my blog. I feel that people who are into electronic/experimental and black metal alike benefit most from what I do. I often imagine purists aren't quite as into it.
p3228
aVI actually got into black metal because of the overlap with the darker electronic/experimental scene.  I've never really been a "metalhead" otherwise.  I don't think other metal subgenres, like death metal or whatever, have nearly as much crossover with that scene.
p3229
aVThat's an interesting comment. I definitely grew up with industrial music but lost interest after a while. I found extreme metal (especially black metal, obviously) and it led me back to electronic, industrial, and noise. I probably attend more live performances of electronic and experimental music than I do metal shows these days. It just works so well.

aVI believe this is lightfox's channel, as he did something similar last year and they have very similar tastes.  Anyways, I was pleased to recognize a solid third of these this year, which is better than last year by far, where I think I managed 5 at most.  Anyways I think the real impressive part of this list is the bottom 3 quarters, the top 25 are the undeniably best releases of the year that I think most people have heard and would agree with.

aVThis. If this was the first track I heared, I wouldn't have pre-ordered (which I did). Pre-ordering is not something I usually do as I like to have heared an album first since you can never really count on past experiences to be more than an indicator. In this case I was swept up by the excitement of the first track and at the very least I feel like I wouldn't mind giving them my money for the entertainment they already gave me. If for nothing else than the extremely enjoble closing gig on their tour with Vreid and Mistur. Other than all sorts of fun happening onstage where the bands where upstaging eachother, the CA frontman singlehandedly made their show mesmerising. I think I can honestly say it was one of the more remarkable shows I 've seen in 25 years, just because of his theatrics, which could easily have slipped over into the realm of silly antics but didn't.

p3331
(lp3332
VNuclear Blast pulled a fast one on us. The full song is 8:13, this video cuts almost 3 minutes of it. 
p3333
aVYeah I realized that after I posted it...oh well.
p3334
aVStarts off decent then progresses into absolute tripe. Wish the production was more raw (but it's Nuclear Blast, what am I saying?) and the clean vocal parts just ruined an already mediocre song.
p3335
aVDude good production and clean vocals is what Enslaved does now. They're doing their own progressive form of black metal instead of pooping out some typical culty noise for crust heads to argue about who listened to it first. Riitiir was awesome in my opinion and this album seems like it should be a pretty good follow up judging by this song. 
p3336
aVTrue, but this sounds like it could have been pulled directly off Riitiir. Hopefully this album explores some new territory a little more.
p3337
aVHopefully it does. I loved Riitiir as well. And Axioma Ethica Odinì I though was killer.\u000a\u000aI've always had a fantasy though that Enslaved would surprise everyone and release an album like Blodhemn with the production quality they have now. I think that'd sound so killer.
p3338
aVThis band has never been \u201espeedy noise BM". Their first albums had enermous speed and a lot of beautiful melodies.

aVI picked it up on CD yesterday and the packaging is fucking fantastic.\u000a\u000aIt sounds like lurker at a lot of points - did he recycle some unreleased lurker stuff?
p3355
aVMore than likely. I know he has at least 5 unreleased LoC albums. Apparently we'll finally get to hear some this year.
p3356
aVThis album is outstanding. Off one listen it's already shot up to my favorite release of the year.
p3357

p3358

p3359
aVOUT-FUCKING-STANDING.\u000a\u000aThis sounds nothing like what he's done before. Amazing from start to finish

aVStep in the right direction for him, his last couple releases weren't doing it for me. Also, he throws in some Lurker-esc vocals and that's always a good thing
p3361
aVYou didn't enjoy Massive Conspiracy?! I don't blame you on True Traitor, True Whore though. Besides Contrary Pulse and Bring Up This Bottom I didn't enjoy it. 
p3362
aVMassive is probably my favorite release of his.   I fell in love immediately! 
p3363
aVSame man! I think this new one has the potential to knock it off as my most listened to though. 
p3364
aVYea never really got into it! 
p3365
aVFunny, I enjoyed True Traitor.
p3366
aVAny songs specifically? I'm willing to give it another go because when it hits the mark he throws all his aggression into it on that album. Just raw hate. 
p3367
aVEh idk which song in particular, I just know that I listened to it on my phone constantly for about half a year while driving to mortuary school
p3368
aVOh solid. I'm actually seriously considering that as a career path. I have a great job now with a local campus but that...culture, is distasteful. Off topic, but any tips on purusing that? If you dont want to discuss it, you're welcome to tell me to fuck off.  
p3369
aVFuck off! \u000a\u000aHaha but no really if you want to get into it the first thing I'd recommend is getting in a black suit and a nice tie and go sound to different funeral homes until one of them hires you part time. Try and get to work services, maybe do removals and run DCs. Really just get the most basic feel for it and talk to the directors/managers as much as possible while you're there about the job.\u000a\u000a I recommend doing this before wasting money/time in school. Find out if you would even enjoy doing the job before committing. The job can be fun, but if it's not a good fit it's miserable.
p3370
aVAwesome man, thanks! I didn't even think to start with part time work directly from the homes. 
p3371
aVrequiem for a turd world was one of my favorites on it anyway.\u000a\u000aRelated to thread, is this album pirated out yet? I can't find it.
p3372
aVIts on spotify. Jeff is one of those few artists I choose to support monetarily, so I'm not going to hit you up with a direct link but I found it yesterday on my usual hunt.

aVI was going to too until I found out he has a wife and kid.   No problem, I'll find it eventually.
p3374
aVThis is head-smashingly good. 
p3375
aVI love the album but I hate the 'samples' (I don't know if they're actually sampled, but I'm just referring to clips of clean speech like "big fucking things that crawls" on the smoke of their torment.\u000a\u000aThis is coming from someone for whom the samples on Lurker of Chalice could not be more perfect (Gregory Peck's speech from (edit: Omen, not Exorcist), the 'desecration of christ' line from Exorcist: The Beginning, Gwyneth Paltrow's speech from "Sylvia.")\u000a\u000aIt's distressing to have something so minor spoiling an otherwise amazing album.
p3376
aV"Every fucking thing that crawls, is going to pay." I am in minor agreement here. They are scattered everywhere and they detract, but it's not enough to spoil it for me. However, I do like when he says "The smoke of their torment shall ascend forever and ever and they shall have no rest day or night! You shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God. You shall be tormented with fire in the presence of the Lamb! Nay, we worship the beast!"

aV"Between Bronze Walls" and "The Clockhand's Groaning Circles" are easily two of my top favorite ~~Ruins Of Beverast~~ Black Metal songs. \u000a\u000aI like to turn up my truck stereo to 11 and blast this while I drive at night with the windows down on the freeway.

p3456
aVI'd rather the individual lines be a little poetic. There's always a line in one of the more elaborate Carach Angren songs which is so clunky and straightforward that it pulls me away from enjoying the track.\u000a\u000aIt's always a line like "Then... two dark figures! They break the window, chase him to the bedroom! They stab him twice in the chest!" Okeydoke.

asVNew to Black Metal: Any Suggestions?
p3560
(lp3561
VIf you like Mayhem, then I would recommend you move onto the other bands in the Norwegian scene. Burzum for starters, then check out Emperor, Gorgoroth, Darkthrone, and maybe Satyricorn. Grand Belial's Key is my personal favourite Black Metal band, so you may want to check them out. They have awesome riffs, pretty good lyrics, and they usually stray from the 'dark' atmosphere of Black Metal, and instead focus on blasphemy.\u000a\u000aBathory is also essential, so check out his self-titled album. Then maybe try Blood Fire Death. If you enjoyed the Viking portions, then check out Hammerheart, Blood on Ice, and the Nordland series. \u000a\u000aLet me know if you need a starting point for any of these musicians, or more recs. I would be glad to help.
p3562
aV&gt; arting point for any of these musicians, or m\u000a\u000aWow, great response, really do appreciate it! Always better to have a starting point than going in blind! =)
p3563
aVNo problem! For Burzum, I would suggest you begin with Filosofem. If you enjoyed that, then try Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.\u000a\u000aFor Emperor, listen to In the Nightside Eclipse.\u000a\u000aFor Darkthrone, if you enjoy Death Metal, then try A Blaze in the Northern Sky. If you're looking for a more pure BM record, then Transylvanian Hunger is good.\u000a\u000aFor Grand Belial's Key, begin with Judeobeast Assassination.\u000a\u000aLet me know what you think, I hope you enjoy!
p3564
aVDefinitely agree with Judeobeast Assassination!
p3565
aVYes, I consider it probably the best USBM has to offer. It's certainly Grand Belial's Key's best album!

aVTry Inquisition because they're awesome.\u000a\u000aRevenge for a taste of war metal.\u000a\u000aRaspberry bulbs/horrid cross/bone awl for some punky black metal\u000a\u000aPseudogod for some good black/death metal. Good listen if you're into Behemoth type stuff.\u000a\u000aSyphilitic Vaginas/Morbid Insulter for thrash/black metal (kinda black and roll-ish) might also wanna check out G.I.S.M. if you like punk (the first album in particular)\u000a\u000aObviously there are a lot of good black metal to recommend, I wanna try to make a "if you are new to black metal" type post, might just take a while and some need of that post.

p3598
aVI wouldn't really say that this is a cash grab. Just ask the average Dimmu or Gorgoroth fan if they know of this musical project's existence. For me, that's not what I want this song or album to be. This album has many good songs on it in my opinion. \u000aSure this album has one of the most famous Black Metal vocalists of all time, but that detracts from what I find interesting about this album. To me, it's interesting that some musicians who are well known in their respective scenes of music have these obscure musical projects that very few have heard of. Granted that this album isn't a GREAT album as I'd take Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult's Nocturnal March or Darkestrah's The Great Silk Road over this any day. I just wanted to bring forth some Black Metal that I like and what other people might like without any controversy.

p3670
(lp3671
VI don't listen to CoF, but it seems like you may enjoy Symphonic Black Metal. A good starting for Black Metal in general also happens to be a Symphonic BM band: Emperor. Listen to "In the Nightside Eclipse" by Emperor, it's a pretty good album. High usage of keyboards, and it's considered essential in the Black Metal scene. [Sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgQRRI9goFg). \u000a\u000a\u000aFrom there, keep looking for Symphonic Black Metal bands. If you enjoy Emperor, I would be glad to give further recommendations.
p3672
aVYou may try Ancient. Not really into them myself, but their album "The Cainian Chronicle" has some female vocals in it. 
p3673
aVThere are a bunch of Band names in the sidebar. They are blacklisted because they are the great names of the genre. Check those out. I think if you started with Cradle of Filth, then Dimmu Borgir would be a very good next step. Especially the album Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia.
p3674
aVI'd recommend Gangrene by Mirrorthone as a decent entry point for you since you like the symphonic stuffs and that album is as good as Symphonic BM gets it my opinion. If you like that you can grab some Emperor,  Carach Angren,  Dimmu Borgir, In Sorte Diaboli is the only album of theirs that has grabbed me personally, and Old Mans Child. Beyond the symphonic though I'd recommend the following to help you pick a style to dig into before covering the rest\u000a\u000aTrashy stuff: Immortal- Sons of Northern Darkness and Destroyer 666- Cold Steel... For an Iron Age\u000a\u000aTraditional Second Wave: Darkthrone- A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Mayhem- Deathcrush\u000a\u000a"Atmospheric": Agalloch- The Mantle and Ulver- Bergtatt\u000a\u000a"Epic": Summoning- Stronghold and Caladan Brood- echoes of Battle\u000a\u000aAmbient: Darkspace- Dark Space II and Paysage d'Hiver- Das Tor \u000a\u000aViking: Bathory- Blood on Ice and Windir- Antonir\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd some other cool albums that I think make good entry points; Tsjuder- Desert Northern Hell, Wormlust- The Feral Wisdom, Marduk- Panzer Division Marduk, and Craft- Fuck the Universe ( the album that turned me onto the genre) 
p3675
aVIf you love the symphonies associated with the genre, then you should check out the band Malevolentia and Ira Diaboli. 
p3676
aVThe most similar band I know is Anorexia Nervosa (except on their first album, Exile).\u000aAlthough somewhat less similar, you may also like the albums Hermh - Angeldemon, Lucifugum - \u041d\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0445\u0440\u044f\u0449\u0430\u0445, and, if you don't mind a good deal of weirdness, Ebonylake - In Swathes of Brooding Light.
p3677
aVIf you like melodic stuff I would recommend Anorexia Nervosa, Carach Angren, Rotting Christ, Eyes of Noctum, Negura Bunget, Dordeduh, Gris, and Sombres Forêts though the last two are leaning more towards DSBM. You might also enjoy Atmospheric Black Metal and Drudkh in particular.

asVCaladan Brood - City of Azure Fire
p3800
(lp3801
VI wrote Caladan Brood off as a second-rate Summoning clone when I first heard them. This wasn't *too* bad, as Summoning are one of my favourite bands of all time, but lately this album has really 'clicked' for me, and this song has a lot to do with that. I think the moment that really unlocked the band's aesthetic for me was the break into clean singing from about 3:25 - 4:10. I think that this sort of thing, when done well, really adds something to this style of music; like that point in Summoning's [Land of the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipoikwHRb8) at 7:30 where the choral element suddenly breaks in, and then it all starts building up again. Genuinely epic stuff.
p3802
aVThey also have some really great Summoning covers on youtube. [The Passing of the Grey Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HlQYXV1p4A) and [Marching Homewards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGqFjUaI5Q). I think the part that struck most with me about Caladan Brood was the Malazan series. Those books are so fucking good.
p3803
aVI love these guys.  I gave them $20 on bandcamp a while back to hopefully encourage them to keep coming out with more music.  If you haven't heard Summoning you should check them out too as they're very similar.\u000a\u000aBandcamp page: http://caladanbrood.bandcamp.com/
p3804
aVCan you recommend me a good summoning album ? 
p3805
aVMy personal favorite is Minas Morgul. It still encompasses the raw aspect of black metal while maintaining the epic feel Summoning is noteworthy for. My favorite songs off the album are "Through the Forest of Dol-Guldur," "The Legend of the Master Ring," "Lugburz," and "The Passing of the Grey Company." Caladan Brood actually did a cover of The Passing of the Grey Company. I definitely recommend listening to all Summoning albums though. Each one really brings something new. 
p3806
aVThere literally isn't a bad one.  Enjoy!
p3807
aVThey're all really good.  I've been listening to Old Mornings Dawn the most lately.
p3808
aVStronghold is my favorite, but they are all solid albums.
p3809
aVIf you want to be blown away right away, just listen to Land of the Dead. 
p3810
aVIf you really loved the Caladan Brood album, I'd say *Oath Bound* is probably your best bet. That said, I think the best Summoning album overall (in terms of consistency over the whole album) is *Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame*.\u000a\u000aI think you may have noticed that you've been recommended damn near every single Summoning album by different people now though, so probably you should just go get them all.

aVWas that a joke?
p3909
aVof course, of course
p3910
aVThey have a very black metal-ish atmosphere. I know a lot of black metal fans who enjoy them but, definitely death metal.  
p3911
aVcool, cool, that makes sense
p3912
aVThis is the correct answer.
p3913
aVgotcha!
p3914
aVNah, it's a video game
p3915
aVFinally, some sense
p3916
aVI thought it was obvious they played death metal. There may be some blackened bits, but it's primarily death.
p3917
aVI guess so, idk I suppose they are on the "darker" side of death metal, that and their stage presence/aliases/stories/lyrical nature made me think otherwise 
p3918
aVNone of the shit you listed matters. What matters is the music itself-- the rest is just pomp and pageantry. Their riffing styles and drumming patterns are all characteristics of death metal more than they are black metal.
p3919
aVVisual and conceptual aesthetics play a huge part in a band's general style. Music as an art form in total encompasses anything that drives the sonic experience as a whole. Music can be heard &amp; felt through your eyes as well. If it couldn't, the 60's-90's never would have happened.
p3920
aVKing Diamond looked Black Metal but weren't Black Metal.
p3921
aVIt's not about what you "look like", it's how that image relates to the aesthetic you *identify with.* King Diamond wasn't black metal, but Mercyful Fate certainly was (at least to the same extent Venom, Celtic Frost, and other "first wave" bands did), and King merely took the style he had adopted and brought it to the new project. Sure, King Diamond's music incorporates some undeniably "blackened" musical aesthetics as well, but they don't orchestrate it towards the forefront of their style. They may have looked black metal, but they weren't advertising themselves as black metal, therefore not identifying themselves with that scene/style. 
p3922
aVFirst wave wasn't actually black metal, m8. It's just a broad term describing the bands that influenced- mostly aesthetically and thematically- what would later become black metal. 
p3923
aVI'm well aware. Hence the quotations around "First Wave". In the context of audial-visual aesthetics, first wave black metal is extremely important, as it introduced a whole new take on the incorporation of stylistic design having an impact on the music it is paired with. In the context of music history, first wave black metal didn't exist, and is a categorical blanket term.
p3924
aVThis is slightly off topic, but do you know any articles that compare and contrast the different riffing styles and drumming patterns of death and black metal?
p3925
aVTrue, but the drums especially sound like black metal techniques. Blast beats aside, even the fills sound familiar. As for the guitar, yes I agree
p3926
aVIt's definitely death metal, but I can see how you'd think they're kvltish. They're very doom cult. Huge following from the doom cult scene.
p3927
aVIf you ever have to ask, the answer is no.
p3928
aVThat's a pretty good rule of thumb
p3929
aVAt first I thought you meant the video game and I was really confused
p3930
aVNope, death metal.
p3931
aVI've heard some people refer to Portal, Abyssal, Ulcerate, et al as "post-death metal" due to their focus on dissonance and suffocating atmosphere, and drawing parallels with DSO. I can kinda see that, but at the same time, I don't think it's different enough to warrant yet another genre subdivision.

p3957
aVYeah Fallen Empire Records is great, loving Vorde right now. Who do you expect to hear from out of Terratur Possessions? I only know their Icelandic black metal bands Sinmara and Svartidauði.\u000a\u000aSo far, I'm looking forward to hearing Melechesh's "Enki" in March and Negura Bunget's "Tau," which I think comes out in late February. 
p3958
aVVorde is fantastic. Awesome live band too. \u000a\u000aTerratur has spearheaded the Nidrosian scene out of Norway. One Tail, One Head, Dødsengel, Mare, Vemod, Celestial Bloodshed etc. I'd be happy with a full-length from One Tail, One Head. \u000a\u000aReally looking forward to the Martröð 7" coming out on Fallen Empire as well as any new material from Lluvia and LVTHN. The Misþyrming LP is coming out next week and being co-released by Terratur Possessions. \u000a\u000aI didn't dig the Melechesh track I heard from the new one. Sounded kinda sterile to me. 
p3959
aVLeviathan next month I think!
p3960
aVDick yeah!\u000a\u000aI talked to Jef a lot about why TTTW was such a departure from the standard(strange word for such a genre boundary challenging band) a couple years ago while he tattooed me. He explained there weren't many blasts because he was having some serious personal problems (he tracked that entire album fucked up) and because he's getting too old to blast the way he used to.\u000a\u000aI'm hoping it was more of the former, as he's in a great place right now. I'm happy for him, and I'm hopeful this new record will have him on his game.

asVLiturgy put out a new song...
p3986
(lp3987
VIt's not really black metal, but I thought it was pretty great. The vocals were pretty bland to me on this track, but Liturgy's music in general seems to have a ton of energy to it, and somehow manages to be grandiose but also minimal. I'm a big fan of experimentation, and I don't really understand why Liturgy makes people so *mad*. I would much rather listen to something that takes risks, even if it fails every once in a while, than some generic black metal band that sounds just like everything else. 
p3988
aV&gt;I don't really understand why Liturgy makes people so mad\u000a\u000a\u000aI'm not speaking for myself necessarily, but I imagine a good amount of Liturgy's criticism originates from HHH's "transcendental black metal" manifesto.\u000a
p3989
aVI like the song too, even the vocals. the rhythmic pattern and monotonal nature fit the track pretty well imo. I love seeing BM spreading into other genres (one of my favorite albums of 2014 was [Lantlos' "Melting Sun"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFJSM3kvBQ4)), but seeing how much hate his "manifesto" got him, I'm not surprised to see them moving away from it. I totally agree with you. I don't want to hear the same album every time someone puts out something new.
p3990
aVNew Liturgy is fucking garbage, alert the press.
p3991
aVInteresting song, don't hear much black metal in it though.  I'll give the album a shot.  Renihilation is an absolute masterpiece so they've earned a few more albums worth of listens from me.
p3992
aVI don't even think that's metal.
p3993
aVto me it sounds like liturgy was trying to play some weird form of electro pop. some of the melodies and harmonies were neat but the vocals kind of put me off. it sounds like MGMT trying to play black metal.
p3994
aVI felt the same way at first, but a couple of listens later had me feeling better about the mumbling voice (which was pretty much the only problem I had with it at first). I do have some interesting black metal if you're interested http://youtu.be/_B2zLiZHOsQ
p3995
aVThose riffs are nearly perfect.
p3996
aV[deleted]
p3997
aVOk, *now* they're really trying to annoy people. \u000a\u000aBefore it was questionable, but considering HHH isn't blind to the negative reception to him, his music and his shitty pretentious black metal manifesto, this guy is stirring the shit for pleasure and adding spice.
p3998
aVLiturgy has always received a bad rap and honestly I could not give a fuck less. This is gorgeous and strange. Maybe it's not black metal, stylistically it only holds true to the genre through tremolo-picking, but it is something new and honest and heartbreaking. I'm not sure what else there is to look for in music. I refuse to be considered an apologist when there are no apologies to be made, because not having to apologize is one of the reasons I got into black metal in the first place.
p3999
aVThe vocals are still weird to me, I think it's just the youtube compression, but I really like what they're trying to do. They seem to be going for the hypnotic, edge of climax effect they had on their previous album which I really enjoyed. I'll be interested in what the finished album sounds like, even though it's not black metal.
p4000
aV&gt;I'm not sure what else there is to look for in music.\u000a\u000aSome people are looking for good riffs and songwriting. Not something "new" and "experimental."
p4001
aVMan, that was even worse than their pseudo-black metal nonsense. Fuck this band!
p4002
aVAside from the pac-sun indie rock vocals I kind of dig it. Kind of.\u000aI don't know.\u000a\u000aActually no those vocals totally ruin it.
p4003
aVWhen I first heard this I just laughed. I hate to use this term to describe it but it is literally hipster garbage. Really, this sounds like it was intentionally made to appeal to the whole indie electronica crowd or some bullshit. 
p4004
aVI support Liturgy as a band who could, potentially, do something innovative and interesting. \u000a\u000aThis ain't it. 
p4005
aV[deleted]

aVBlack metal is satan, satan is black metal.  \u000aWhy is liturgy even on this sub?
p4007
aVThat HHH kid needs to take his manifesto and his trust fund and piss off already. I'm a little sick of seeing this band mentioned anywhere these days.
p4008
aVI like to keep an open mind about black metal (hell, I even liked some of Aesthetica), but this song was just SO terrible.\u000a\u000aIf i'm going to listen to hipstery black metal, I'll put on Altar of Plagues or Deafheaven, not this garbage.
p4009
aVCompletely disagree on Altar of Plagues. Sorry.
p4010
aVWhat do you mean by that? 
p4011
aVWhile Altar of Plagues did see a decent fanbase, they in no way were creating music with a goal of cashing in off of a trend or making a record label happy. They did what they wanted, when they wanted. I see a lot of arguments online where people also say that Teethed Glory and Injury was trying to cater to that kind of crowd, but I don't agree. At all, actually. If you listen the whole way back in their discography to their Through the Cracks of the Earth demo, James always showed a liking for electronics in their music. All of the sudden, in this post-Deafheaven hipster resurgence, blah, blah, whatever world, TGaI is for some reason looked down upon when, in my mind, it was their most accomplished piece of work. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe nail in the coffin on that argument, though? Do two Google searches. On one, pretend that you're shopping for a Deafheaven t-shirt, and the other, an Altar of Plagues t-shirt. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAltar of Plagues did things on their own terms. Altar of Plagues was in the business of making art. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDeafheaven are peddling their wares on any online distro that will have them. Deafheaven is in the business of making money. Bottom line.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut hey, at least we can both agree: Liturgy is trash.
p4012
aVWell said! I've always staunchly argued that Altar of Plagues were better at what the mainstream press claimed Deafheaven were doing, but with Teethed Glory they really moved in their own direction. It makes sense that they broke up and James picked up Wife after its release.

p4037
aVNorsecore is a pejorative term for blasty, fast, would-be-thrashy-if-it-wasn't-played-at-400-bpm black metal. Oft-cited examples include [Tsjuder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE5QekLPjEg) and [Marduk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZskXIVgIkEE), who are actually Swedish.
p4038
aVWell to be fair, Swedes were Norsemen also.
p4039
aVI personally don't see how it's pejorative. I think Norsecore is a badass name for a genre. It's pretty fitting of Marduk. Is it an example of classic Norwegian racism haha? They appear to view Swedes like the Scottish view the English.
p4040
aVI don't think it's pejorative either. That wasn't an opinion, I was just describing the context in which Norsecore was originally used. Yeah, there is playful inter-Scandinavian rivalry and certainly that exists in bm, but that's not really what this is about. It's more about people who aren't a fan of this type of black metal deriding it based on those features. It's been embraced by people who like the style to some extent, but you're more liable to see somebody using it to make fun of a band than to describe themselves as a "Norsecore fan".

aVLots of Summoning in here. Anyhow: nice tune.

aVSpeaking of, what is the deal with this band? Are they supposed to be summoning-worship or are there similar members? 
p4140
aVWell-they're interpreting another epic fantasy novel. I've never read an interview with them, but I'd guess it's part worship/part doing the same thing with Steven Eriksons novels that Summoning did with Tolkien. /r/malazan if you'd like to know about the series.

Do you remember which country the band was from? You might want to check the folk or pagan metal subs too.

aV/r/neofolk
p4187
aVDude, this comment changed my life. Thank you.
p4188
aVI wouldn't necessarily equate the two. What neofolk would you say has similarities to black metal? Von Thronsthal, Rome, Spiritual Front, Sieben, OTWATM and so on certainly don't.\u000aBands like Empyrium certainly could be considered as overlapping the two genres, but saying that Neofolk is basically acoustic BM doesn't make a whole lot of sense in my mind
p4189
aVI don't think they're equal - I think "acoustic black metal" doesn't/can't exist and that whatever the OP is looking to get from it he'd be more likely to get from neo-folk.  They share similar themes and a similar overall negativity (at least among the bands I listen to).  Do I think he'd be well-served by bands closer to the martial industrial end of the spectrum?  No.  But I think bands like Sol Invictus would fill that role pretty well.
p4190
aV&gt; I think "acoustic black metal" doesn't/can't exist\u000a\u000aWhy not? You could get a [shaman to bang a drum at 47bps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFRDhgVs-1Q) whilst another musician plays tremolo riffs on a [balalaika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn06W-iBfkQ)
p4191
aVBecause black metal is not whatever people want it to be.  It's black *metal*.  It has both musical and ideological/thematic elements, and bands lacking either one of those don't qualify.  \u000a\u000aI don't understand why, on this subreddit, there is such a large faction of people who categorically refuse to even consider the notion that the music they like might not actually be black metal.  Music can be good without being black metal.
p4192
aV&gt; It has both musical and ideological/thematic elements, and bands lacking either one of those don't qualify.\u000a\u000aNo. Take out those ideological/thematic elements and a band is still a black metal one- metal genres aren't based on imagery, ideology, or feels. Just riffs. \u000a\u000aWhat would you call a band like Smargroth that takes generic power metal fantasy lyrics and plays black metal over them? Are you going to try and redefine them for not meeting any black metal rules for playing with the appropriate attitude?
p4193
aVI think you've approximated the difference between true black metal and shit 'black metal'
p4194
aVThere is no "true black metal" versus "black metal"- just good black metal versus bad.\u000a\u000aSure, the morons making stuff like Smargroth aren't usually making anything worth listening to, but it's still black metal.
p4195
aVNext you'll say that Christian bands can be black metal bands.  I'm not redefining anything - it's not all black metal.  
p4196

A lot of of the folk-derived/volkisch black metal groups typically have acoustic side projects or generally more folky material.\u000a\u000aHere's what I'd recommend for straight neofolk/acoustic black metal:\u000a\u000a* Ulver - "Kveldssanger"\u000a* Agalloch - "Tomorrow Will Never Come," "The White"\u000a* Burzum - "Hliðskjálf" [more ambient than acoustic/folk]\u000a* Drudkh - "Songs of Grief and Solitude"\u000a\u000aI'd also recommend Ancient VVisdom and Boduf Songs: neither are what I would consider black metal by any stretch of the imagination, but they're certainly influenced by the aesthetic. Boduf Songs' "Burnt-Up on Re-Entry" is probably the best place to start in that respect.

aVNot Black Metal, but theres lots of great crusty folk punk bands that use fast riffs and screaming in their lyrics. Like Daze N Daze, Blackbird Raum, Broken Bow. Granted, lyrics are nowhere close to those of black metal. so if you're in it for lyrics stick to neo-folk. probably not what everyone's looking for but its worth a look if you're into folk and/or crust punk.

p4304

aVHell yeah another Algor fan. Not so sure about the second album as to me it leans too much towards the symphonic dimmu borgiresque territory, but the first album is fucking outstanding

VHere's a tip: if you ever go through a breakup, don't listen to Xasthur. This album did not help me work through my grief. In fact, I would say it made me SLIGHTLY MORE SAD
p4335
aVDude, I discovered Xasthur when I was going through my divorce. It was both a blessing and a curse.
p4336
aVXasthur is probably the best DSBM band out there... and the best thing is that it's over. Malefic doesn't pathetically try to carry on a band that no longer expresses his feelings, and since there are very few ideas that Xasthur hasn't implemented, it would just be sad if it tried to carry on, and it might become really pitiable, like Burzum now is.\u000a\u000aIt's a very special band for me... probably the first band ever that I really liked, and even today I can listen to it for hours on end.
p4337
aVNicely put. I remember seeing that vice documentary that showed him before knowing anything about Scott. It was like finding out who Iron Man was. 
p4338
aVFuck yeah, man. I seldom listen to anything after Subliminal Genocide.  Every full-length including and preceding that album is a masterpiece in my eyes.  Such a mystical atmosphere and drenched in (in)human emotion.  Xasthur holds up more than almost any BM band for me after sort of falling out of the scene around 2010.
p4339
aVFuneral of Being is the best Xasthur release. 
p4340
aVYeah I tend to agree, though Nocturnal Poisoning was pretty close. I like almost all of them to some degree, but Telepathic With the Deceased never really rubbed off on me -- I'm not sure what about it was slightly off-putting compared to most of his other material.

p4466
aVIt's largely been my favourite genre of black metal. One of the most notable acts to come out in the past few years, in my opinion, is Sadness. Though it can be a very hit and miss subgenre. There's a lot of really generic shit out there, but what's good is phenomenal. 
p4467
aVI've heard a few songs from the genre, I'd recommend the song [TotalSelfHatred - Total Self Hatred] (http://youtu.be/4WZZ35-H8Fk). The vocals are fucking ghastly. Production quality is good too.

aVBig DSBM fan here, predominately what I listen to. I avoid Silencer and fellow shriekers like the plague though.

aVSometimes, but not very often, it doesn't really appeal to me like other black metal does. Plus I always end up comparing all DSBM bands to Celeste and haven't found anything that I prefer over them. 
p4474
aVNot a fan. I like a lot of the atmospheres but a lot of the recording quality sucks. The vocals usually take me out of it too
p4475

p4477
aVPretty much my opinion as well.
p4478
aV[deleted]
p4479
aVI really started getting in to DSBM just over a year, I prefer it to a lot of classic norwegien black metal just because it focuses more on emotion and atmosphere I think. \u000aPlus I feel its a genre that can accurately portray depression because theres no such thing as too extreme really, the screaming, dissonance and low-fi recording really adds to it.
p4480
aVI just figured it was somber sounding Black Metal. Nothing to branch out over. Xasthur is great. Forgotten Woods etc
p4481
aVNot really a fan.  What DSBM I have heard has been either too sad and depressing or too boring for my tastes.  In neither case does it match the powerful, exciting beauty of BM.  I listen to music to feel good, not bad.
p4482
aVI love it. Honestly I tend to like it more then regular Bm. When I first heard Abigail by Happy Days I knew I was hooked.
p4483
aVI have Nattramn's back here. A DSBM discussion isn't complete without [Silencer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZlZuYp1fZc). His vocal work has polarized many DSBM listeners, but I think it does the genre justice.
p4484
aVNo. I think DSBM is the reason why so many people associate actual Black Metal with Screamo or Emo trash. The whole "Life is terrible, I want to kill myself." theme is just a publicity stunt, and I really wouldn't mind if they actually did kill themselves.
p4485
aVI get what your saying, but I don't think it's as disingenuous as you suggest. It's definitely a weaker perspective and subject matter compared to the average metal band, and I understand why that would turn a lot of black metal fans off. I think there's a lot of authenticity in music that conveys feelings of genuine sadness and depression. That is, if it's done correctly. I really don't enjoy most dsbm on a musical level, but it has nothing to do with the subject matter. 
p4486
aVdamn, thats harsh
p4487
aVNot really harsh. I never go online and tell people to 'kill themselves', because it just seems like a really mean and edgy thing to do.\u000a\u000aBut in this case, I think it's appropriate. If all your music is about killing yourself, then there's no reason as to why you shouldn't have done it yet. (Assuming you actually think that way.)
p4488
aVNot to derail the thread, but there are actually a few very good reasons a person would be fixated on suicide and not go through with it. Depression isn't just a linear line leading to suicide.
p4489
aV"It's a joke because so called "Black Metal" fans here are praising this album. You can't be a fan of Black Metal, and then enjoy something like this. Or claim that it even has similarities to Black Metal. This is a joke, and the band should just kill themselves already."   \u000a   \u000a^ Looks like you told Ghost Bath to go kill themselves in another thread in this sub today...
p4490
aVYeah, did you even fully read my comment? \u000a\u000a"But in this case, I think it's appropriate. If all your music is about killing yourself, then there's no reason as to why you shouldn't have done it yet. (Assuming you actually think that way.)" \u000a\u000aI usually don't tell people to 'kill themselves' as an insult. Mainly because it's been done to me before, and it's really rude. But in this scenario, I think it's appropriate to suggest that they should commit suicide.
p4491
aVSure, and every band with songs about holocausts should just go out and slaughter millions of people. 
p4492
aVThere's a difference. People write lyrics about what interests them. But these people who write things about 'holocausts' don't say these things in interviews. They don't murder the interviewer, do they? They're perfectly normal, they just write lyrics like that because it's 'trendy'.\u000a\u000aGhost Bath on the other hand... Just try reading an interview with them. Or Shining. They seem for real, because they talk about hating themselves. MOST bands separate themselves from their lyrical content and their personality. Not Ghost Bath.

aVListen to all of the main bands in the Norwegian scene. Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor, Immortal, Gorgoroth, and perhaps Satyricon. From there, you can tell what type of Black Metal you like. But don't forget to check out a few bands in the American scene. Grand Belial's Key is a must.

aVIf you like Bathory you're already more advanced than many of the people on this subreddit.  Which period of Bathory do you prefer - the earlier, darker, thrashier stuff, or the later pagan/Viking oriented stuff?  That will help me tailor recommendations.

aV[deleted]
p4510
aVCheck out agalloch. 
p4511
aVI found my way into blacker stuff via bands that mix traditional black metal with other genres:\u000a\u000a**Enslaved** are easy to get into. A bit of a progressive sound, with their style changing quite a bit between the years.\u000a\u000a**Rotting Christ** and **Melechesh** have a very riff-driven and melodic style to their music, but not to their detriment. Really good stuff.\u000a\u000a**Dark Fortress** and **Septic Flesh** are a bit more atmospheric in some of their songs, especially the later albums.\u000a\u000aOthers have recommended **Immortal** and I have to agree. At the Heart of Winter is definitely a good starting point.\u000a\u000aEdit: Also check out the bands in the sidebar. They're blacklisted for a reason - because so many people love their music.
p4512
aVI prefer the German black metal.\u000a\u000aminus the NSBM, the anarchist black metal. and all the neo nazi black metal.\u000a\u000ajust cant handle that shit.\u000aBut the more melodic german black metal is what I like to hear.\u000a\u000aI cant quite remember any specifically I used to listen to, but I think Fyrnask might be german. Lantlos is german(they are more DSBM) Wandar is german i think. Coldworld might be german? cant remember.\u000aYea I obviously like the darker side of black metal. \u000a\u000aHeres one i dont hear often here. Mammal - Altar of Plagues.\u000a\u000asuch a fucking sick album instrumentally. And the message the band is portraying lyrically is something ive kind of connected to for a long time.\u000a\u000aoooooooohhhh The new Darkspace album is really good. its a bit different, but i Love it. Everything that dude makes is really good. but his band Darkspace is my favorite. Especialy after the last album
p4513
aV&gt;minus the NSBM, the anarchist black metal. and all the neo nazi black metal\u000a\u000aYeah man, the only thing important to me about black metal is the lyrics, too.
p4514
aVAnd not being offended as well.
p4515
aVThe foundations of black metal.
p4516
aVMaybe if most of it didnt sound like shit id listen to it.
p4517
aVGimme some examples of what you've heard. The only reason I can think of for not liking most NSBM bands if you like other black metal is if raw production isn't your thing, but I don't know why you'd be in a black metal sub if it's not.
p4518
aVIve mostly just rummaged through blog/album posts on random websites. A lot of it was really underground I guess. More local to their areas and online and shit. Sometimes the lyrics and songnames and shit are humurous to me, but eeh.\u000a\u000aI dont mind the raw production, I just prefer DSBM and more solid sounding melodic black metal is all.And by that, No i dont mean bands like Alcest or deafheaven. I cant fucking stand that shit.\u000a\u000aI guess my favorite shittily produced album is by Barghest. The self titled one. shit is fucking sick dude.\u000a\u000aand holy fuck I almost forgot Strid. old strid. Some Grimlair is good to me also. I liked some of those french bands.
p4519
aVDo you want recommendations? There's good stuff out there that you've probably been missing out on.
p4520
aVNah. I honestly dont really enjoy black metal as much as I used to. Ive been getting into ambient/harshnoise/experimental shit lately.\u000a\u000aI also make music, so it kind of goes hand in hand.\u000a\u000aThanks anyway though. Maybe suggest them to anyone else who may be interested in those sub genres?
p4521
aVI used to be pretty into making weird shit with found sound and percussion and stuff, but I have more fun writing riffs and playing punk shows now. \u000a\u000aOrder of the White Hand and Goatmoon are also very much worth checking out. 
p4522
aVIm just perfecting my production skills amigo!! I love doing live shows. havnt done one in a loooooooooooooong time. \u000a\u000aIf i could get my hands on some visual light equipment id be doing some pretty experimental live shows hhaha\u000aIve always wanted to do some really fucking dark ambient/black metal
p4523
aVPlaying shows is the best, dude, I love it. It's like masturbation for my ego. My main project is a metal punk sorta band, but I've been playing with some free jazz dudes who really know how to cook, and an old band of mine is getting back together to record more stoner party jams. Do you have links to any of your music?

aVI'm checking out your latest track right now. Classic "stretch a sound clip out in audacity" -core.
p4526
aVToo bad, thats not at all what happened.
p4527
aVHa, I'm just messing with you dude. What was the process behind that one?
p4528
aVYou got the audacity part right. Im sure thats obvious to anyone, but its layers of the same song mixed together at different speeds. Like the original song I composed that out of was just a short acoustic riff I played. \u000aJust an overly post edited acoustic guitar track hahaha\u000a\u000aIts more complicated than that explanation, trust me. My main concern as of lately, is to try and 'polish' my sounds a bit more so they sound clearer and better. better ratios and shit. Ive only been recording and producing for about 2 years now so im still in my diapers.
p4529
aVI record everything on a cheap 4-track. I can't do much in the way of polishing.
p4530
aVId kill to have a 4 track dude. \u000aI mean, all my polishing goes in once its recorded. So the recording is really just me trying to find something that fits the mood at the right time, but also sounds good enough to be turned into something else.\u000a\u000aI dont have any keyboards or anything either. Just guitars and, whatever other noises i can find.\u000aIve made a song using a microwave, and some generated/edited sounds
p4531
aVI just have a Tascam Porta 02 mkII. They're like 30 bucks on ebay. Pretty limited functionality, but if you're looking to put sound on a tape it's the cheapest way to do it (unless you want to bounce tracks between regular cassette decks or use a shitty little memo recorder). If you're not totally broke, though, you should definitely look into something with more inputs, XLR inputs, and the ability to EQ. All I can do is pan and adjust volume, and I have to do weird shit with whatever PAs and interfaces I can borrow if I want to use real mics/more than two mics.

p4553
aVYeah man I get where you're coming from about the odd differences, but I'm in a doom band, we got 2 grind, 1 pornogrind and a hardcore band on it so it already isn't making much sense, I just like DSBM so I'm hoping some kids just want to get their name out you know?
p4554
aVBad grindcore (including pornogrind) is even worse than NAZI BULLSHIT.
p4555
aVI'm super picky about my grindcore(as well as black metal) and I think porngrind is immature but thats not the point im getting at. I could preach how its wrong for hours but theirs no point in that, theirs a line to be drawn within specific genres. For pornogrind I won't consider any song names that blatantly glorify rape and I wont consider any NSBM. Plus about two-thirds of the people putting this comp together are mixed race.

(I'm too lazy to confirm for myself.) \u000a\u000aBut it sounds terrific to my ear. For the effect(s) on the listener Jeff so clearly wanted to achieve, I thought the vocals were pitched at a suitable place in the mix. Can't wait to hear more.

aVI really wish he'd ditch the fucking audio mastery. His own recording methods are cool as hell. Still better than most anything, but call me a faggot that I think Leviathan's getting worse.

VFirst group i've ever heard using 6 and 12 tone row techniques, and one of the few using complex time signatures.  This album is fucking insanely good. it really broadened my horizon on capabilities of metal..
p4689
aVTry Jute Gyte. That'll mess with your perfect pitch haha. 24 tone black metal is an interesting beast
p4690
aV&gt;First group i've ever heard using 6 and 12 tone row techniques\u000a\u000aGot a source for that? Their music is certainly chromatic, but I haven't noticed any usage of serial techniques. Not that that's something that's easy to pick up on, so I may have just not noticed it, and if they've talked about it in interviews or something I'd be very interested in reading about what they're up to.
p4691
aVMost classically trained musicians wouldn't be analyzing this kind of music, so I did it myself.  So I guess my source would be perfect pitch and 6 years of studying music in college.
p4692
aVGood enough for me. In that case, could you point me to some of the places where they're using tone rows? Anything else cool you came across? I'm still working on getting my head around this album. I love those angular, serpentine melodies that they use, but there's a lot of it that my brain hasn't quite locked in on yet.\u000a\u000aI wasn't trying to be antagonistic, by the way. I'm just inclined, based on my experience, not to automatically trust redditors to know what they're talking about with regards to music theory.
p4693
aVWhat are row techniques? I don't know much theory but I find the way this band sounds to be really interesting and I wish I could write stuff like this
p4694
aVA basic form is using each of the notes once before repeating any of them, this is done to achieve equal use of each of the notes and create truly atonal music.\u000a\u000atarnkek's comment reminded me that Jute Gyte has a greate example of this, but this wasn't done with the 24 tone guitar: [Jute Gyte - The Irreality of the Past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtbVOct1f84) \u000a\u000aEhnahre is another band that toys with using tone rows, but not as directly as the above example.\u000a\u000aI also didn't notice any on Sacred White Noise, but like brutishbloodgod said, it isn't always easy to just sit and notice these things.

Vi dont think this is black metal. it also kind of sucks. just for comparison's sake, Artificial Brain's (another NY tech outfit) recent release is unabashedly death metal, yet it is still truer BM than this crap.
p4746
aVDude, say what you will about IT, but Artificial Brain has absolutely nothing to do with BM at all. Not that they aren't phenomenal.
p4747
aVYour call. I think Imperial Triumphant is fantastic, and embody a more avant-garde/forward thinking image of modern black metal. Their new record is one of my most anticipated for 2015. If you are willing to give them another shot, their album can be streamed at their Bandcamp, and at only 25 minutes, it isn't a huge investment of time. http://imperialtriumphant.bandcamp.com/album/abominamentvm\u000a\u000aThis looks really spammy, but I have no connection to these guys other than I really dig their music. I just think other people may be interested in it due to the dense complexity of it. As well, I know some people have a hard time getting into the older black metal, so this may appeal to people who like a more modern sound.  \u000a\u000aOn the topic of Artificial Brain and black metal, I thought their demos had a slight black metal tone to them.

asVWhat is everyones problem with Deafheaven?
p4770
(lp4771
VObviously I can't speak for everyone, so I'm gonna explain why I dislike Deafheaven *personally*. \u000a\u000aFirst, I don't think they're Black Metal. And I think anybody who has actually listened to a few Black Metal albums will be able to notice this too. There are no other elements of Black Metal in Sunbather besides the vocals. Now 'Roads to Judah' actually contains some Black Metal. But that's another story.\u000a\u000aNext, I'm gonna be honest, they're pretentious hipster fucks. Yeah yeah, I'm judging a band from their appearance. But I used to be a minor fan of Deafheaven. Their target audience and fanbase is not a group of people I ever want to associate myself with.\u000a\u000aSo to summarise: Most BM fans dislike Deafheaven because they're not Black Metal, and Sunbather is just bringing in a bunch of hipsters to the BM scene who think all Black Metal is similar to Sunbather. I don't like the music, personally. But I don't have a reason to publicly hate on it. I only dislike when people label it as Black Metal. \u000a\u000a
p4772
aVInteresting, i have a few questions for you then. \u000aPretentious hipster fucks? What do you mean by that? Just beacuse of the fact that you're not wearing corpsepaint and slaughtering goats onstage does not mean that you can't play black metal. And also why is it not black metal musically? I mean theres blastbeats, tremolo picking, loud distorion, screams and shrieks. Basicly everything characteristic about BM. So do people hate on a band like Behemoth? They're more death metal today than black but they still look like a black metal band onstage. And what is the problem with more people entering the bm-scene and challenging it?
p4773
aV&gt; And also why is it not black metal musically? I mean theres blastbeats, tremolo picking, loud distorion, screams and shrieks. Basicly everything characteristic about BM.  \u000a  \u000aThese elements are a small part of their music. If anything they're post-metal influenced by black metal, but that doesn't make them black metal.  \u000a  \u000a&gt; So do people hate on a band like Behemoth? They're more death metal today than black but they still look like a black metal band onstage.  \u000a  \u000aYes, many people hate Behemoth. I hate newer Behemoth after Grom. I have no idea how this is news to you.  \u000a  \u000a&gt; And what is the problem with more people entering the bm-scene and challenging it?  \u000a  \u000aBecause they're proclaiming membership in something they do not believe in, or belong to. If anything they're not challenging it. They're diluting it and pissing on it.
p4774
aVVery well said. OP, read this.
p4775
aVI know I'm going to sound like an elitist, but to me, there are more traits of Black Metal than just in a musical sense. Sure, if a song has all of the traits of BM, then it's BM. Simple. But I would still have difficulties calling them Black Metal, if that makes sense. It's difficult to explain - Anything can *sound* Black Metal, just using all the traits of Black Metal. But I would still have difficulties calling the band 'Black Metal' if they were Vegan hipsters living in Seattle somewhere.\u000a\u000aAnyways, musically, they're still not Black Metal. Production is clean as hell. The lyrics aren't in any way similar to Black Metal. Look at the fucking cover art man. Do you expect someone to look at a pink cover with fancy font and go "Fucking brutal BM BM album man, what's its name?" No. I'm sure a musician can explain it more in-depth in a technical sense, but sometimes you just have to trust your gut. Compare the song 'Transilvanian Hunger' to the song 'Dream House' (Lol, what  a BM name...) Then tell me straight-faced that they're the same genre.\u000a\u000aAnyways, shit like Deafheaven is becoming more and more common. Bands such as Lantlos, Alcest, Krallice, Liturgy, etc. are sprouting up everywhere. As a result, people have made a new 'genre' called Blackgaze. WHICH I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE USE. Why, you may ask? \u000a\u000aLet's take everyone from a Liturgy show, and put them in the same room as everyone in a Sargeist or Arckanum show. These people don't get along together in real life, or on the Internet. We shouldn't lump these genres and fans into the same genre. Only controversies will sprout.\u000a\u000aAnyways, hopefully I answered your questions. I just did some random mind babble. Let me know if you have any more. Keep in mind I'm answering strictly from a personal point of view.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p4776
aVI have no idea how people can define black metal only musically. It's not entirely about lyrics either. It's about an idelogy, if you ask me.
p4777
aVideology about what?
p4778
aVThis is in itself a good question. For me the idea of black metal is best expressed as the militant intolerance of weakness and the supremacy of strength.
p4779
aVIm not trying to attack anyone here, but what you're saying is that black metal is not a musical genre but an ideology about the militant intolerance of weakness? So like kill the handicapped people or what? 
p4780
aVPete helmkamp. The conqueror manifesto. There's your starting point. 
p4781
aVOk kid, you got your answer and now you are just being annoying. Deafheaven is not a black metal band. You clearly wanted to argue that they are, and were not actually interested in the educated responses to the contrary. I can confirm this because [you tried to get /r/progmetal to back you up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2pguc7/can_anybody_help_in_this_argument_against_black/).   \u000a   \u000aIts time for you to shut up and go away.   \u000a- One of the Elite
