VWithout A Name - Never Be The Fakes (2014) [Japan]
p1
(lp2
VI LOVE Without a name ever since Sickened back in 2008!

asVOmnium Gatherum - Soul Journeys [2011]
p4
(lp5
VWhy hasn't this been upvoted more? Fucking sick band, sick album... \u000aI actually preferred Everfields over this song, but I have never heard an OG composition that I didn't like.
p6
aVI prefer almost every other song on the album to this one... but it's still a 9/10 track.\u000a\u000aSaying that, the entire album is one of the most consistently strong albums I've listened to in a long time. Hooks you in from Everfields all the way until you get to the sensational ending that is Deep Cold (note : I didn't like the song that much, then they closed with it live, and I was awestruck at how fitting of a closer it is). The only albums that compare, imo, to that level of great consistency are Above a Weeping World (my #1, where New World Shadows is #2) and Shadows of a Dying Sun (#3) - both by Insomnium.\u000a\u000aAlso, I didn't upvote because I figured an Omnium Gatherum post is more often then not going to look like karma whoring :P
p7
aVI loved this entire album and Beyond. So awesome. The title track of New World Shadows is incredible, too.
p8
asVIn Vain - Floating On The Murmuring Tide - [9:15]
p9
(lp10
VI just found out about these guys like a month ago. Now they're becoming one of my favourites. They're a solid group.
p11
aVAgreed.  nothing mind blowing like when I heard Opeth the first time.  But, as you said, SOLID.  And that's hard to find!
p12
asVIn Dread Response - Earthen Bonds (2014) [New Zealand]
p13
(lp14
VLooking forward to their third album whenever it drops.\u000a\u000aFirst was great, but def. went overboard with some of the song lengths.  I didn't care as much for the second, but it was still pretty good.  It sounded too clean and the guitars were all over the place.  The 'epic' feeling of the first on felt more muted. 
p15
aVAs a Kiwi and a bogan, I approve. 
p16
asVSymphonic Melodeath?
p17
(lp18
V[Wintersun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alo7A0NLmxU) has to be the most obvious one.\u000a\u000a[Persefone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_LtFlqBtuU) is pretty solid (it might be a bit more on the proggy side then symphonic side though. I gave you an intrumental to judge for yourself)\u000a\u000aEternal Tears of Sorrow (sorry no links, as I don't know them other then by name) and Whispered are also possibilities.\u000a\u000aI definitely agree with you on the symphonic side. A little is good, but some overkill is bad. I tend to love the melodeath that uses keyboards, but not as a driver to the music (look at Insomnium - particularly the last 3 albums, in terms of adding atmosphere -, Omnium Gatherum - last 2 here - and Words of Farewell - who nail this concept to a T).\u000a\u000a(AND I AM DAMN READY FOR AT THE GATES. Late 2014, at least.)
p19
aV[Kalisia - Cybion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0f_N6nTpmA)\u000a\u000aThis album is best listened to in one sitting, but it definitely has symphonic influences, as well as many others. Probably one of the best pieces of music I have listened to in years.

aVTry this one out. Haggard is the name. I think they are pretty badass and certainly have a classic/symphonic/opera style to them.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IInS1orjRJU
p25
aVCheck out shadows of the dying sun by Insomnium. You can stream the whole record from youtube. Its more atmospheric but close enough.

p27
aVNot sure if it's what you're looking for, but [Equilibrium](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yom8nNqmxvQ) might fit the bill. They're a little more Folk Metal, but they're still a fantastic band.
p28

VI am so fucking stoked for this album
p69
aVSame, but i hope that after 19 years they're still able to keep some of their old sound and not do what In Flames did.
p70
aVAs soon as it leaks, expect to hear bitching about it sounding too much like their other albums and not doing anything new.
p71
aVIf this is even 80% as good as Slaughter of the Soul I'll be satisfied. I have confidence they won't pull an In Flames.

(lp76
VPretty damn good. I am surprised. The last IF cover I heard was fucking horrible.
p77
aVThanks a lot! Yeah, everybody has to start somewhere and I guess lots of people start with In Flames. 
p78
aVThey do.. And it often backfires. \u000a\u000aI liked it. I liked the two different vocal styles. I think Johan's (you?) eq could have done with a bit of a prescence boost around 3-4kHz to pop the sibilance and improve intelligibility. Guitarist nailed it too. Well done. 
p79
aVThanks for the input man :D we'll definitely try to improve from time to time since this is our very 1st cover ^_^\u000a\u000a-Sham-

p84
asVArch Enemy - As The Pages Burn (2014) [Sweden]
p85
(lp86
VI like the song but, and this is probably going to sound a bit nitpicky, I don't like the way she growls syllables with an 'a' in it, the ones that sound more like a deep 'o'. Something about the voicing there just doesn't do it for me. To cut her some slack, poor girl really has the biggest boots to fill in that one can find...
p87
aVCanadian accent. 
p88
aVI actually think the vocals are the best part of the song. The instruments feel really generic AE to me but I still enjoyed it.
p89
aVMuch better than War Eternal. Wish Alissa would sing clean though... Guess it won't happen eh?
p90
aVI hope not.
p91
aVI hope so 
p92
aVAm I the only one that likes Alissa's vocals more than Angela's? I'm fairly optimistic about the new album. 
p93
aVSounds good to me so far and I have high hopes for the album still after these 2 tracks.
p94
aVI like this one a lot more than War Eternal. You can hear more of Alissa's style here. I hope the whole album is this good!
p95
aVVocals aren't bad. As far as replacing Gossow goes, this is as good as I imagine it can get.\u000a\u000aThe music doesn't reach me like some of their older releases have, though. It doesn't have that catch and impact I love Arch Enemy for. \u000a\u000aI really hope the rest of the album kicks it up a notch. 
p96
aVGod I hate her whispery voice. No power to it. 
p97
aVCan't fucking stand this new chick. So forced sounding, nothing natural. Honestly wasn't even a huge fan of Angela to be honest, but she never sounded anywhere close to this bad.
p98
asVBloodshot Dawn - Demons (2014)

asVThe Duskfall - Farewell (2014 - New Song)
p125
(lp126
VI really dig it. It feels like they never broke up, notwithstanding the new singer. While I do wish it was still the original singer, I think his vocals might be a little outdated since we've heard some really innovative vocal stylings recently. I think the new vocals actually makes it stand out from the cookie cutter but excellent, melodeath that they in the mid-00's.  
p127
aVThey sound different...but the same.\u000a\u000aReally liking the singer, too.
p128
aVTried getting into this band recently, but wasn't digging the vocals all that much. This however is excellent!

sVYour melodeath gateway band?
p160
(lp161
VAmon Amarth and In Flames were my gateway bands, a friend gave me a few songs.
p162
aVAmon Amarth is a gateway band into all kinds of music. And fucking great to listen to. Every time I listen to Twilight of the Thunder God I want to grow my beard out further, braid it, and pillage the English countyside. 
p163
aVChildren of Bodom. A buddy of mine burned me a double CD of "Follow the Reaper" and "Hate Crew Deathroll." InFlames was the second. 
p164
aVBodom got me used to death metal vocals as well.
p165
aVInsomnium, followed by In Flames and Wintersun. Opened my eyes to a new way to appreciate death metal.
p166
aVCarcass, back during Heartwork.  \u000a\u000aFuck I'm old.
p167
aVI got into In Flames and Soilwork both simultaneously around the Reroute to Remain/Figure Number Five era. \u000a\u000aOnce I got into them I went backwards in their catalogs and fell in love with their old material, which led me to other stuff like At the Gates, Dark Tranqullity, etc.\u000a\u000aBefore then I had only listened to metalcore bands like KSE/Shadows Fall and the like, and nu metal before that.
p168
aVCtrl+V, Ctrl+P\u000a\u000aKSE used to be a fav of mine. Listened to them recently, holy fuck is that shit bland.
p169
aVReally? I love their new album. I fucking love melodeath, but sometimes a good metalcore jam is much needed. I'm probably going to get crucified for admitting that haha.
p170
aVDon't let assholes make you feel bad for liking a type of music.  I don't understand people who feel that a metalhead can like melodeath, black, folk, but isn't allowed to like metalcore.  There is plenty of good metalcore.
p171
aVHeh, well you can listen to whatever you please. If that's what you like then good for you. Don't let other people make you feel bad for liking the thing you like, after all there is nothing more subjective and down to personal tastes than music.
p172
aVShadows fall isn't metalcore. They are NWOAHM. Them trivium and many more underground bands. You can check out stuff like the absence, and dirge within for more modern american metal. 
p173
aVWhat is that acronym?
p174
aVNew wave of american heavy metal
p175
aVMy first melodeath song was Cloud Connected by In Flames. I didn't really start to get into the genre until my freshmen year of college when I started to listen to Soilwork. Even then I was mainly listening to metalcore bands like Killswitch Engage, Avenged Sevenfold, and Atreyu. I ditched those bands about a year ago though, and have been listening to melodeath ever since.\u000a\u000a
p176
aVIn Flames - Clayman, Kalmah - Swamplord\u000a\u000aI honestly can't remember what came first, but both really introduced me to the genre.
p177
aVChildren of Bodom. I got a copy of Follow the Reaper when I was 10 and loved it. 
p178
aVArch Enemy/Children of Bodom\u000a
p179
aVIf you can count it as one - you probably can't - it would be Amaranthe.\u000a\u000aYeah, didn't think so. Anyway, the real answer would be *Eluveitie*, I suppose. Death metal-folk metal hybrid, that one. *Thousandfold*, while painful to listen to at first, got quite tolerable very quickly. That was my gateway.\u000a\u000aI decided to keep listening to their stuff despite the initial discomfort because I reasoned I need to increase my metal tolerance, or I'll be stuck listening to the same five bands forever. It wasn't a bad decision. I can listen to some really good shit now that I can tolerate the growls.
p180
aVI maintain that Amaranthe is absolutely an acceptable answer.\u000a
p181
aVNew album drops next month!
p182
aVDisarmonia mundi.  Specifically common state of inner violence.
p183

p189
aVThe Bereaved, Kiana, Dark Age and Across The Sun

aVAmon Amarth and the song was gods of war arise.
p191
aVAmon Amarth, I thought the whole viking thing was pretty cool.
p192
aVAmon Amarth with "across the rainbow bridge". In Flames, Insomnium, At the Gates and many other great bands helped me keep my interest. 
p193
aVin flames - colony. the first track is still my favorite melodeath song to this day. then i discovered carcass and was sold on the genre.
p194
aVThat opening riff on Embody the Invisible is such a great way to start the album
p195
aVI was introduced to melodeath, and in metal in general, by a mate of mine when I was 16. I started with things like Bullet for my Valentine, before getting heavier with Killswitch, and then my mate showed me Soilwork, specifically, Stabbing the Drama.\u000a\u000aEven though I wasn't a big screaming fan back then, I loved the song. Been a melodeath fan ever since
p196
aVSoilwork got me into melodeath, and I am pretty positive about their new album!
p197
aVPretty sure it was [Resurrection Code](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqFgQrLFz1g) by Disarmonia Mundi. Now melodeath is in my top-3 favorite metal subgenres.
p198
aVMPE. I binged The Unborn and nothing else for months. I wasn't able to find anything of the same quality for a while when I burned out on it, but soon I happened upon Punish My Heaven and the rest of The Gallery. 
p199
aVExactly the same! We're Only-for-the-Weak-buddies!
p200
aVThe heaviest music I listened to at the time was probably All That Remains. Anyway, I got The Darkness, a horror action game on the 360 and loved the shit out of it. During said game, you encounter TVs with a tonne of stuff on them, including The Duskfall's Shoot It In.\u000a\u000aI fucking loved that song. Every time I went by one, I'd hit up the music channel and wait for that song to finish. I looked up the band and found they had four albums out. Being the unemployed 17 year old I was living in New Zealand where it was impossible to even buy the albums if I wanted to, I downloaded them. Loved the shit out of that band. A few months passed and I had a job, so I was able to scour the internet until I found a place that had them in stock and shipped them to New Zealand. When the CDs had arrived and I nearly destroyed my ears listening to them, I decided to look the band up to see what they were doing. Touring, making a new album, etc. \u000a\u000aThe band had split up two weeks before I got the CDs. I've been listening to them ever since and until I found this sub, I discovered that they have reunited (Although I can't find much info in English) and are working on a new album. I cannot wait.
p201
aVSylosis and Edge Of Sanity
p202
aVparasite inc. pulse of the dead I am new to listening to melodeath but I like it a lot. 
p203
aVOlder-era All That Remains.
p204
aVThere were so many I got into all at one time. Eternal Tears of Sorrow, Mors Principium Est, Kalmah, Children of Bodom, and Dark Tranquillity
p205
aVI used to be strictly into Metallica and Megadeth. I hated music with screaming or growly vocals. But i remember a friend of a friend left a burnt CD with various metal songs on it at my house. Most of it was Metallica, Type O Negative, Stone Sour type music on it. But it had this one song on it that was really melodic and had some amazing keyboard parts in it as well. But it also had the screaming vocals as well, so I was confused to if I really liked it or not. But the more I listened to it, the more that it grew on me. After a weeks worth of listening to that song, I was hooked, but i had no idea who it was still. Flash forward a couple weeks later, I'm watching Uranium and low and behold that song comes on and it says that it's from some band called Soilwork.  I've been a melo death fan ever since.
p206
aVSoilwork back in the days of Stabbing the Drama. Although the first songs I ever heard from them were from Natural Born Chaos.
p207
aV[deleted]
p208
aVNorther for sure, kind of weird I haven't seen anyone else post them.
p209
aVSame here. I believe it was around 2003 after I saw a video of [Mirror of Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEXb5hKRek) Before that I listened mostly to nu-metal (Linkin Park, Papa Roach, spinehank) and Tool. After Norther came In Flames, Soilwork and Dark Tranquillity who since then have been accompanied by a whole lot of other bands.\u000a\u000aI now listen mostly to a mix of Melo-Death, folk metal and the occasional Doom, symphonic and prog metal.
p210
aVinsomnium
p211
aVChildren of bodom for me, "if you want peace prepare for war"
p212
aVEquilibrium is what got me into metal.
p213
aVAmorphis - silver bride. I got into metal in general through Gothic/symphonic so melodeath was the next logical step :P
p214
aVFor years I was the biggest Metallica nerd until I heard "Code Of Honor" by Deadlock.  Instantly hooked.
p215
aVScar Symmetry- Morphogenesis was really what started me off. The whole Holographic Universe album did actually.
p216
aVI was shown Amon Amarth by this awesome dude when I was in Sweden. The song was Runes to my Memory. I already listened to TBDM by liking deathcore and metalcore but that was it. I also discovered At The Gates and In Flames on that trip to Sweden.
p217
aVAt the Gates - Slaughter of the Soul (the song). I used to play Tony Hawk's Proving Ground a lot for the ps2, listened to that song so much I started to like it. At the Gates is one of my favorite bands now. 
p218
aVDT AND ATG 
p219
aVAmon Amarth, as most here, and their tune Valhall Awaits. 
p220
aVHonestly shadows fall was the first band that got me into modern metal. I had always been a fan of shit like black sabbath and metallica, but hadn't really got into more modern metal. From there I found shit like trivium and then started looking into foreign bands. The first of these was In Flames, although honestly I had heard so CoB prior.
p221
aVAmon Amarth, guardians of asgaard. Children of Bodom, bodom after midnight. There are probably more that made me go "holy shit what is this magic I'm listening to!?"
p222
aVScar Symmetry show me the way, and Soilwork opened the door. Those are still my two favorite melodeath bands
p223
aVChildren of Bodom and Amon Amarth. The first melo-death song I heard was Downfall by CoB and I was immediately in love with the melodies, but the vocals took some getting used to. As for Amon Amarth, I much preferred their vocal style over CoB's but they weren't as technical instrumentally but they had some killed riffs and the first song I heard by them was Pursuit of Vikings.\u000a\u000aThose two bands basically got me into all types of metal more extreme than Thrash. From there I discovered some of my favorite bands today like Kalmah, Dark Tranquillity, Insomnium, Wintersun, Eluveitie, and The Absence\u000a\u000a
p224
aVDefinitely Amon Amarth
p225
aVFirst one I heard was In Flames. The song "A Touch of Red" was played on a metal music channel, and I was in the habit of writing down band and song names that I could look up later on. I'm not sure if this is also how I found Dark Tranquility, but they came next.

p246
aV&gt; * In Flames - The Jester Race\u000a&gt; * Insomnium - Since The Day It All Came Down\u000a\u000aWow, just listened to those, and they're bloody brilliant!  Thanks for the recommendation :)
p247
aVSo sad the Insomnium album isn't "Above a Weeping World". (It. along with the "Shadows" album by OG (New World ...) and Insomnium (... of the Dying Sun) make my personal top 3, in that order. Since the Day in incredible, though.\u000a\u000aSo, so sad.
p248
aVThe problem with Insomnium is that I can never choose a fav album, they're all equally amazing. So really any album of theirs on the list is enough.
p249
aVWhoa there, let's not call it a problem, let's call it "The beauty with Insomnium" :P\u000a\u000aI get what you mean though. I have an emotional attachment to AaWW (Last Statement, in particular) along with it just being so great. Shadows is recent, but I'm a huge Vanhala fan, and I love the overall message behind it so it should stick to 2nd. But I always seem to change the order in my mind of which one comes after all of that.\u000a\u000aThat said, if AaWW is a 11/10 for me and Shadows is a 10/10, AtD and Since the Day are both 9.5/10 (recently changed my mind on AtD), and In The Halls... and OfS are both around 8.5 (just not nearly as consistent as everything else... that said, great albums).
p250
aVYou forgot something\u000a\u000aAt The Gates - Slaughter of the Soul
p251
aVSomebody else already commented that so it was unnecessary.

aVBe'lakor - Stone's Reach
p254
aVAllagaeon- Fragments of Form and Function
p255
aVAgreed; my first suggestion would be At The Gates - Slaughter of The Souls :)
p256
aVI like this idea.  So many people jump onto this subreddit to ask for recommendations.  An essential albums list in the sidebar would be a great resource for those new to melodeath.  Unfortunately, I foresee some potential arguments.\u000a\u000aI suggest laying down some ground-rules, like 20 albums total and only one album per band, for example.\u000a\u000aAside from those mentioned by /u/SilpheedX3, I feel that Soilwork should be on the list with either Natural Born Chaos or A Predator's Portrait.  Other bands like Arch Enemy (Wages of Sin, maybe) and Scar Symmetry (Holographic Universe) have released some must-hear albums.
p257
aVThat sounds like a good idea, I'd say ten albums (don't want to overwhelm newcomers) and only one album per band so there's enough variance. The easiest way to do it is probably a poll, I can look into getting one set up tomorrow when I'm back at a desktop and hopefully we can get a mod involved to push this through
p258
aVI'm what you would call a lurker - by relative means, I am a "newcomer", and I honestly would welcome a mass amount of music. I find there is not enough on here. 
p259
aV[deleted]
p260
aVI'd say a list with a max of 2~3 per band isn't a bad idea, because sometimes people prefer one album over the other, and yet both are in the same realm of greatness.\u000a\u000aExample, it's how I feel of Insomnium's "Above a Weeping World" (over) and "Shadows of the Dying Sun", Dark Tranquillity's "Character" and "Fiction", Words of Farewell's 2 albums, Be'lakor's latest 2 (although "Frail Tide almost makes this a trinity of awesome), and etc...\u000a\u000aI see a lot of people have very high scores for "Across the Dark" and "Since the Day it All Came Down" (for Insomnium), "The Gallery" and "Damage Done" (DT), for example.
p261
aVGotta be A Predator's Portrait. That's by far the best of their pre-2005 albums
p262
aVCarcass - Heartwork
p263
aVNot quite sure why you got downvoted for that one; surely Heartwork would have to be on the list?  It was so influential on the genre...

(lp271
VI use Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros and they are really good imo, best headphones I ever had.\u000a\u000aFor a better recommendation you could check out the daily thread on /r/headphones
p272
aVI always wanted these headphones because they are highly rated and looks so comfy. The only problem is they need an amp to get the full experience.
p273
aVYea, I use the FiiO E10, want to get a Mayflower or Schiit Dac though.\u000a\u000aAnd there starts the endless spiral of buying even more expensive audio equipment to "get the full experience".
p274
aVI'm not really an audiophile that much, but I just want to upgrade my current headphones. I think I'll be fine without an amp and might buy a cheap one eventually.
p275
aVThe 80Ohm version should be fine with onboard power from your PC, or a cheap sound card like the Xonar DG.\u000a\u000a/r/headphones
p276
aVI'm mostly using them on my laptop/mobile but I think I'll be fine with the 80 Ohm version as you said.
p277
aVTry asking on the /r/headphones subreddit for confirmation. They have a daily question thread.
p278
aVWill do!
p279
aVThe question has been asked many times before, so a search probably wouldn't go amiss either. I just can't remember what the general consensus was on laptops and 80ohm headphones...
p280
aVSennheiser make really good headphones in the $80-100 range. I have the HD 202 model and I LOVE it; they cost around $90 after tax so they are affordable. Don't bother with the "Beats" garbage. You pay for the name, not quality.
p281
aVI use Sennheiser HD600's and I'd highly recommend them, *but* they're around $330 on Amazon right now. Might be able to find a better deal elsewhere, though. Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros are also a good option like /u/lordofprimeval said but they also seem to be a little over $200 right now.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCheck out  Audio-Technica ATH-M50's, they'll fit your price range and they're also very good quality. They're one of the most recommended headphones for beginner audiophiles. I bought a pair myself out of curiosity and I can vouch for them. There's more than one model, there's also the ATH-M50X, and there's also a package deal that includes a small portable amp.
p282
aVHD600s are definitely out of his budget. They will not sound good without a decent amp which would be bare minimum another $50. \u000a\u000aI am a huge fan of sennheiser tho, and would definitely recommend checking out the HD598s tho.
p283
aVI think the Jaycar Pro/Brainwavs HM5/Fischer FA-003/etc are a better choice for a flat freq response and are in the same price range as the M50.\u000a\u000aOP: Check out /r/headphones, innerfidelity.com, head-fi.org.
p284
aV[Alessandro Music Series One](http://www.alessandro-products.com/main.php?p=headphones)\u000a\u000aThe MS1 is a slightly tweaked pair of [Grado SR80i's](http://www.amazon.com/Grado-Prestige-Series-SR80e-Headphones/dp/B00L1LXOWS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410111851&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=grado+sr80i), which are widely considered to be some of the best headphones for metal among the audiophile community because of their ballsy and in-your-face aesthetic.  The Alessandro phones are subtly improved and are a little more well-rounded.\u000a\u000aAlso, since they're $100, you can spend that extra $100 you saved on sweet merch!
p285
aVI have a pair of Grado SR225's. Can't go wrong with Grado and metal.
p286
aVAdding in my support for Grado. Damn my next upgrade is going to be expensive.
p287
aVHow much sound comes out of them? I'm guessing they're not for Office/Shared environments. I like the sennhwiser HD25 and HD280s. \u000a\u000aThe Grados do have great pedigree - it's just the open back that stops me. \u000a\u000aI'd also recommend the JDS Labs Objective2 + DAC for powering a pair of lovely headphones. 
p288
aVI got the Sennheiser HD438's for about $120AU back in 2009, and despite my best efforts to destroy them (I stood on one of the cups... that was a bad day) they're still going strong to this very moment. They've got pretty good all round sound quality too, so good for listening to things other than melodeath.\u000a\u000aDon't think you can get them anymore (discontinued) but the newer HD 4XX models are a great mid-ranged set of headphones. 
p289
aVI'm using AKG k601 with a super cheapo amplifier to get some more power out of them.\u000a\u000a
p290
aVLG HBS-730 - in ear headphones are great because they block out other noises and you can hear each song better
p291
aVI use a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50's that just sound perfect. I think they're one of the best under $200 monitors around. I spent the first weekend burning them in and I was good to go. As far as I can tell everything from the low end and mids are pretty flawless (bassist of 11 years, that's important to me). The highs can push the headphone to their limits but since I don't listen to a ton of music with lots of highs that doesn't bother me much. \u000a\u000aI also listen to a bunch of other genres that all sound great, especially well produced Indie Rock and Post Rock.

p296
aVI'm leaning towards the ATH M50's mostly because of the great price and because they seem to be praised by many around the sub reddit.

p346
aVGreat! Two new songs for my mellodeath collection..
p347
aVNot as classic as other listed here, but I think Disarmonia Mundi really does Melodic death metal extremely well.

p349
aVI agree but not in the way you'd think.\u000a\u000aThey very much do make straight up melodic death metal. But they do it in the purest form that sounds extremely bland and void of anything really unique.

p351
aVThe song that got me into melodeath...hmmm...it's either Dry Run by Dark Tranquility or Change of Heart by Insomnium.\u000a\u000aI'd say Lost to Apathy is a good definition of melodeath.

You can hear it that they make no compromises when it comes to the music they play.\u000a\u000aAnd what got me into the genre...\u000a\u000aInsomnium - [Down with the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K003TNG40P8)\u000a\u000aDoesn't need any explanations, does it?

p378
aVAnything off of slaughter of the soul. That record was insane. \u000a\u000aAs for me I was late to the party. In Flames -sounds of a playground fading got me into the genre as I went back and listened to older in flames back when they were still melodeath. Finally I went back to  subterranean and heard "Everdying" and "Stand Ablaze" which is when I fell in love with melodeath. If you haven't heard these two songs I highly recommend them.
p379
aVEither [In Flames - My Sweet Shadow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbUtiOfMzpk) (perhaps my first melodeath song), but I think [Amon Amarth - Embrace of the Endless Ocean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf8vFNQPnh0) captures it.

aVIn Flames got me into the genre, song in particular is [Resin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnJcu90oHEw)
p385
aV[Insomnium - Weighted Down With Sorrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR6vqaa4d1s). \u000a\u000aIt encompasses the listener with a beautiful, yet dismal atmosphere. Every part of the song gorgeously adds to the other segments. It builds a glimmer of hope before releasing all aspiration with the ever more apparent bleak reality established by mere existence. \u000a\u000aThis song is the essence of Melodic Death Metal.
p386
aVIf I were going to pick one song to play for someone that didn't know what melodeath was I think I'd pick [Barren Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=warP8oB7sxc) This song IMHO has it all.
p387
aVThe song that got me into the genre is "Ensiferum - Lai Lai Hei". But my very definition of melodeath are the songs "In Flames - Gyroscope" and "Dark Tranquillity - Insanity's Crescendo". 
p388
aVI can't say one song but I really any song from The Black Dahlia Murder and At the Gates. 
p389
aVFirst melodeath song was In Flames- Cloud Connected. I just really liked/ like Anders vocals on that song. I tried listening to some of there other stuff, but at the time I first heard in flames, I wasn't really knees deep in metal yet. I hated the metal screams that most bands did, and mostly stuck to bands like Breaking Benjamin, Avenged Sevenfold, &amp; Metallica that mostly did clean vocals. I still do have a thing for clean vocals, but there's just something so epic when a singer does a metal scream. Thankfully, I've seen the light, and ditched those bands, in favor of bands like DT, In Flames, Scar Symmetry, Sylosis, MyGrain, and Soilwork.
p390
aVHard to pick just one.

aVPunish My Heaven by DT is the flagship song to me, but Victorious One by Norther (even though there's some Power in there) is also pretty standard for the genre, IMO.

aVSounds a lot like their older albums, but with way better production. I'm loving this!

aVThat headbanging is fucking majestic. Cool song too!
p401
aVMPE doing their job, hehe.
p402
aVIs it just me or does MPE need to up the volume of the vocals?  It was the worse for the whole "The Unborn" album.  Still, fucking love this band.
p403
aVthat bridge riff is so damn addictive. 
p404
aVMPE just being MPE.\u000a\u000aKind of amazing that after losing both of their guitarists after 3 albums, they still come out guns blazing with the same sound. A step forward from "And Death Said Live" imo.

(lp416
VThe only thing I didn't like was the sound of the chorus. It just sounded really corny. Other than that I really liked it! I really liked the line especially:\u000a\u000aThere are bodies infinite\u000a\u000aoutside this earthly dome.\u000a\u000aBecause it serves as a reminder to humans that its highly possible that we aren't alone in the universe.
p417
aVThe only part I didn't like about the past couple albums were the clean vocals. Seems like I'm not gonna be liking them this time around either. The screamer fits perfectly but just sounds bad next to the clean vocalist. Christian was much better at creating melodies and harmonies over the brutal and crazy riffs Scar Symmetry throws in our faces all the time.
p418
aVI agree. Christian is the man. 
p419
aVFantastic. This album is going to be great.
p420
aVSeems a lot better then their previous two records. Not too fund of the chorus, but it's decent. Excited for now.\u000a\u000aStill. I do not have any hopes for this ever topping their work with Christian. It's on godlike status in my book.
p421
aVI cannot wait. The lyrics make it seem more like a throwback to the style we expect from Scar Symmetry, since Unseen Empire seemed more conspiracy theory-themed overall.
p422
aVI really enjoy the space theme in metal bands like these guys, Allegaeon, Lunarsea, and Fractal Gates.
p423
aVI have to say that Lars Palmqvist's vocals are getting better to my ear.  The last album had so many moments where you just knew he wasn't a native speaker of English, and it got a little painful.  Or maybe I'm just getting used to hearing him.

p463
aVFor sure. Love the job they did with Ephemeral (compared to the EP) too.\u000a\u000aAlbum as a whole is great. Best since AaWW for sure. Insomnium's always a grower, so I'll where this ends up.\u000a\u000aOnly song I wasn't a huge fan of was the ballad "Lose To Night", but overall this album is amazing. Diverse for sure.

asVInside The Particle Storm by Dark Tranquillity

(lp562
VThis is one of the most menacing songs I've ever heard.  I listen to a lot of Metal, own hundreds of albums, a lot of it really heavy, dark shit, but I'd be very hard pressed to find a song that weaves such a vivid tapestry of dread and foreboding as this song.\u000a\u000aThe only other one I can think of off the top of my head is The Gathering Wilderness by Primordial. 
p563
aVJust looked up the lyrics and yeah you're definitely right, it is one of their darker songs. If you like dark songs like this though, I'd recommend you check out Nevermores Dreaming Neon Black. One of the darkest and in my opinion best metal albums. The darker tracks are Deconstruction, Fault of The Flesh, and No More Will.

aVThe songs are awesome.\u000a\u000aAs for Vicky's voice.. I still can't figure out if I'm just not used to it yet or if her clean vocals are actually kinda "weak". Either way, something about them does not feel quite right. Maybe it just takes more time to get used to her singing.\u000a\u000aBut definitely check out the new songs.

I can see elements of at least 4, if not all 5, of their albums in here, blended into something familiar yet something new.\u000a\u000aAfter one listen of this one I know it's going to take a while to digest what is going on here (ala In The Halls of Awaiting or Since The Day).\u000a\u000aThis album is going to be a treat.

p603
aVMy biggest gripe with this MV is the themes they chose to run with. This is not Behemoth, so I don't see why this Grupa 13 company saw the need to put in some random moose skull and why the chick had to get decked in goth/circus make-up.\u000a\u000aThe birds and nature imagery were more than adequate.

aVoh how I envy you... the thought of liking Scar Symmetry without knowing of Disarmonia Mundi... You're in for a treat my friend.

p616
aVIt is really good. The band seemed energized with Jessie's return.
p617
aVSince Disarmonia Mundi has already been suggested, I would suggest Mercenary. Check out their *The Hours That Remain* release for some really good songs that are entirely or mostly clean vocals.
p618
aVGreat suggestion, but I already have a lot of Mercenary in my collection \U0001f44d 
p619
aVIf you aren't a fan on the harsh vocals you could try progmetal. You can get a lot of the same instrumental sounds without harsh vocals.
p620
aVCheck out Sonic Syndicate, although not as heavy as scar symmetry they have the same overall feel to them. In Flames and Soilwork are also two really good bands that might tickle your fancy if you like Scar Symmetry. Really anything Melodic Death Metal is the genre your looking for (my personal favorite genre of metal)
p621
aVListening to pitch black progress right now actually. People think they're cheesy? That's crazy talk
p622
aVHave you tried Mygrain? I don't know if they have more clean than Scar Symmetry or not, but they could be worth a try.

aVPerhaps [Dead by April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw8dmny9qAc) would be of interest then? Nice songs, but a bit more on the softer side.

aVRise To Fall - Defying The Gods, has harsh vocals but there is a nice balance of cleans in every song. Same as SS, the vocals have a lot of post processing to polish them, but still good nonetheless.\u000a\u000aUniversum - Mortuus Machina, Nice cleans, and Alvestam does guest vocals on three tracks I believe.\u000a\u000aAmaranthe can barely be considered anything but pop-metal after the latest album, but they have some seriously catchy choruses.\u000a\u000aLast but not least, one of my favorites (RIP), Sybreed.

p645
aVI saw them on the opening night of the tour in NYC. They put on an amazing show. I just wish people weren't recording it on their cell phones and actually watching the show. Maybe because it was a Sunday but it seemed like the crowd was not the greatest I've been a part of. \u000a\u000aThere was even a guy front and center, who looked like an Indian greaser, he spent more time looking back at the crowd than at the band. Like he was afraid of being mugged or something. He left the floor during DT's set. 
p646
aVVery few amateur photographers at the show last night, which was nice. 
p647
aVI've found that to be a big problem. Even more so with the all ages shows.   Its really starting to bother me. 
p648
aVIt really is! I don't even see the point. The sound is too loud for cell phone mics, it'll just be blown and distorted. And on top of that you risk breaking your $600 mini-computer. And chances are if you're pulling out your phone at a show, your face is glued to it in the outside world so why risk it?
p649
aVI'm going to start bringing my 11" tablet and holding that up. I think that will get the point across.

aVI'll repost this from the other thread. \u000a\u000a&gt;**Blackguard**: I'd recommend both of their albums, Profugus Mortis and Firefight. They're a pretty fun Melodic Death/Folk Metal band.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Blood Stain Child**: An interesting band that somehow fuses Melodic Death Metal and Trance of all things. I've only really given their album [Epsilon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vobp17bP17c) a listen, but it's really fucking good stuff.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Carcass**: I'd recommend Heartwork and their newest release, Surgical Steel.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Children of Bodom**: I haven't given them an extensive listen, but I know Children of Bodom is all sorts of fun Melodic Death/Power Metal.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Dark Tranquillity**: One of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands. I'd recommend Haven, Damage Done, Character, Fiction, We Are the Void, and Construct. Mikael Stann's vocals are amazing.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Disarmonia Mundi**: I'd recommend Fragments of D-Generation, Mind Tricks (+re-release), The Isolation Game, and The Restless Memoirs (EP). Soilwork's Bjorn Strid did a ton of vocals for this band.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Eternal Tears of Sorrow**: I've only listened to their album, Saivon Lapsi, but their entire discography seems good to me.\u000a\u000a&gt;**The Few Against Many**: Their sole album, SOT, is incredible, especially because they have Christian Alvestam on vocals.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Hypocrisy**: I'd recommend Abducted, The Final Chapter, Hypocrisy, Into the Abyss, Catch 22, The Arrival, Virus, A Taste of Extreme Divinity, and End of Disclosure. Hypocrisy is one of my absolute favorite bands that definitely emphasizes the Death Metal part of Melodic Death Metal, as well as Peter Tagtgren's vocals being fucking awesome.\u000a\u000a&gt;**In Flames**: One of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands. I'd recommend The Jester Race, Black-Ash Inheritance, Whoracle, Colony, Clayman, Reroute to Remain, Soundtrack to Your Escape, and Come Clarity. In Flames was one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Kalmah**: I'd recommend [their entire discography.](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Kalmah/702)\u000a\u000a&gt;**Ka\u0308lter**: I'd recommend both albums, Spiritual Angel and Ubuntu.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Mercenary**: I'd recommend 11 Dreams, The Hours That Remain, Architect of Lies, and Metamorphosis. \u000a\u000a&gt;**Mnemic**: I've only listened to Sons of the System, but Mnemic overall seems good.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Parasite Inc.**: I'd recommend their sole album, Time Tears Down.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Raintime**: I'd recommend Tales From Sadness, Flies &amp; Lies, and Psychromatic.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Satariel**: I'd recommend Hydra, and White Ink: Chapter One.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Scar Symmetry**: I'd recommend Symmetric in Design, Pitch Black Progress, Holographic Universe, Dark Matter Dimensions, The Unseen Empire, and The Singularity (Phase I - Neohumanity). After Holographic Universe, they parted ways with Christian Alvestam, and picked up Lars Palmqvist and Roberth Karlsson (note: TWO VOCALISTS) to replace him. Scar Symmetry was one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Shade Empire**: While Shade Empire is a mixture of a lot of genres, I'd highly recommend Omega Arcane.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Skyfire**: I'd recommend their entire discography. I haven't given Skyfire an extensive listen, but it's good.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Soilwork**:  I'd recommend A Predator's Portrait, Natural Born Chaos, Figure Number Five, Stabbing the Drama, Sworn to a Great Divide, The Panic Broadcast, and The Living Infinite. Soilwork is one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal, and Bjorn Strid's vocals are amazing.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Solution .45**: I'd recommend their sole album, For Aeons Past. Christian Alvestam is the vocalist. I don't have to say anymore, really.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Sonic Syndicate**: I'd recommend Eden Fire, Only Inhuman, and Love and Other Disasters. \u000a\u000a&gt;**Starkill**: I'd recommend Virus of the Mind, I haven't listened to much else, but it's good.\u000a\u000a&gt;**The Stranded**: I'd recommend their sole album, Survivalism Boulevard. Both members of Disarmonia Mundi are in this band.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Swallow the Sun**: I'd recommend their entire discography.\u000a\u000a&gt;**This Cold Life**: I'd recommend Ascent of the Fallen, and Fallacy.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Torchbearer**: I'd recommend Death Meditations, as I haven't listened to much else. Contains Christian Alvestam and Satariel vocalist, Par Johansson.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Universum**: I'd recommend Leto Destinatus, and Mortuus Machina. Christian Alvestam does guest vocals on a few tracks on Mortuus Machina. Surely you see a trend by now.\u000a\u000a&gt;**Wintersun**: I'd recommend Wintersun, and Time I.

aVJust heard a few songs of them, sounds good! Thanks
p752
aVBe'lakor and Omnium Gatherum are pretty popular around here, you might enjoy their stuff, old and new.
p753
aVYou can take a look at soilwork their early stuff is melodic deathmetal.\u000aAlso Disarmonia Mundi is pretty cool. 
p754
aVDisarmonia Mundi doesn't exist anymore (sadly) but Ettore formed another band called [The Stranded](http://open.spotify.com/artist/5LMMZvbGwZIA966LqhsEyw) it's actually pretty damn cool!
p755
aVI checked their Facebook and blogspot. They did record some new stuff and still exist. The only thing it's delayed and the stranded is put on hiatus. Check http://disarmoniamundiofficial.blogspot.com
p756
aVWow... With The Stranded I thought they were gone, it's great news they're not! :D
p757
aVAllegaeon's worth a look if your into interesting lyrics. No clean vocals though sadly. \u000a\u000aGhost Brigade however has an incredible clean vocalist. Not melodeath though; more melodic doom/ death metal.
p758
aVYeah, Ghost Brigade is good, I know them too, vaguely :p\u000a

aVHey rik another Belgian melodeath fan here.  I might have some suggestions for similair bands although im still pretty new to the genre.  Im not at home at the moment so im just commenting to save your post. That way i can help you this evening.
p760
aVIm not good at analyzing songs and genres etc But here are some things that I enjoy that fit your description (loosely). But a lot of these songs are not just melodeath but combinations with other genres.\u000a\u000a\u000a* [opeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oWhkjQWE24)  Melodeath/progressive. This is the band that got me into melodeath and is still my favorite band. It mixes progressive metal with melodic death. You should definitely check out their album Blackwater park.\u000a\u000a\u000a* [Agalloch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHJjSSrR6x4)  Melodeath band that uses a lot of clean vocals. But some people dont really like their clean vocals.\u000a\u000a\u000a* [Between the Buried and me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcHv-VNFypA)  Another progressive/melodeath band now also with some metalcore influence. Using a lot of more silent parts with calm vocals.\u000a\u000a* [The Agonist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdT7M4f2L9A) Band with female singer that also sings quite a lot of cleans. I guess you kinda dig it or you don't..\u000a\u000a* [Iced Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi2byoKN-GM) Not really melodeath but I really also like this band.\u000a\u000a\u000aSorry if you already knew most of them and dislike the ones you don't know. I also only recently started listening to melodeath. And most bands just don't use clean vocals...\u000a
p761
aVI love Iced Earth, lost track of them too, to be honest, but listened a lot to them few years back.  \u000a  \u000aI know Opeth allready, just don't consider them in the same genre as DT, IF and ATG, but that's just me probably :p  \u000aIt's sooo difficult to diversify into genres, defo genres in the metal-genre. To me, it's all about the sound, not what name there's on it
p762
aVYeah totally agree. Also did you go to graspop last summer? DT, Opeth en Carcass played. It was great!
p763
aVYeah, I go to Graspop every year, I work there backstage. Didn't get to see DT, and I feel very bad about it, but I was at shift at that moment..
p764
aVAh that sucks. It was my first graspop (im only 18) and I was really happy that a lot of my favorite bands played. Dark tranquility was really great in my opinion. I really liked the videos playing on the back panels.
p765
aVAgalloch as melodeath?\u000a\u000aI have no idea if somehow they are different after The Mantle and Ashes Against the Grain, but they are far from melodeath in either case. Atmospheric Black/Folk (edit : Oh yeah, and Doom) is as close as you're going to get in there. Opeth has it's moments (and inspired a lot of the big melodeath bands in some way, so it's normal to associate some of the sounds in melodeath to them, and thus them to melodeath). Don't listen to the other 3, but iirc they fall into progressive/metalcore, metalcore and heavy, respectively.\u000a\u000aI think you use the melodeath umbrella as holding a lot more then it normally should. Which is fairly normal when you get to some prog / metalcore (blame At The Gates for that influence there) stuff. With time you start to notice the differences and similarities between the groupings, and sometimes even the influences that go between them.
p766
aVSorry man as I said I don't know a lot about genres and I also said those are just bands that popped in my head when I read his post. But you are probably right yes.
p767
aVNo worries.\u000a\u000aAt least you have good tastes with Opeth and Agalloch :P
p768
aVHow we're at 14 comments and I don't think we saw a single mention of Insomnium is beyond me. Maybe look into "Mortal Share", "Down With The Sun" and "While We Sleep" as an intro.\u000a\u000aLook at their first album (In The Halls of Awaiting) - there's a significant (imo) In Flames' type riffing going on. Then they just evolve from there into their current state (/greatness). Nillo's growls are pretty clear, imo, and they incorporate some cleans in the 2nd half of their discrography (Across The Dark - on).\u000a\u000aI'll also second the mentions of Be'Lakor ("From Scythe To Sceptre" or "Neither Shape Nor Shadow"), Omnium Gatherum (go for the last 2 albums, for songs try "Ego", "New World Shadows" or "New Dynamic"), Mors Principium Est, Ghost Brigade (although they aren't really melodeath, still have a sound that's similarly enjoyable - go for some random stuff off either Isolation Songs or IV - One With The Storm). You can also try Words of Farewell.
p769
aV[Anterior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6avjB6i8ek) incorporates a few different styles in their music, Gothenburg metal being one of them. \u000a\u000aThere might be enough there for you to enjoy.

p817
aVI could have gone a bit further with In Flames. Nicolas Engelin joined for a short period from '97-'98 then joined Gardenian and after Jesper Strömblad left Engelin rejoined the band. After lead guitarist Glenn Ljungström left the band in '97 after Whoracle was released both he and Jesper formed Dimension Zero.\u000a\u000aAfter both Ljungström and Engelin left Björn Gelotte who had drummed since The Jester Race switched to lead guitar and Daniel Svensson joined the band from his previous band Sacrilege where he drummed and did vocals.
p818
aVdon't forget the Hammerfall connection either.  Oscar from Ceremonial Oath and Stromblad from In Flames started Hammerfall as like a side project or something.  just released 9th studio album... 
p819
aVAlso (not melodeath) one of the guitarists in Hammerfall was in Ceremonial Oath I believe, and I think Jesper Stromblad played w/ Hammerfall briefly. Jesper was also in Sinergy, Alexi Laiho's other band, but he's Finnish so we're getting out of hand now

VI will never grow tired of listening to this song. So incredible. 
p938
aVGreat music. Unfortunately the vocals don't do it for me. 
p939
aVJust out of curiosity, how come?
p940
aVI suspect that it doesn't click with me because of the narrow tonal range. I got started in melodic metal with Soilwork and since that's what I can in on, now I prefer a vocalist to have good range. I can do all harsh vocals, but it doesn't usually resonate with me unless there's at least good range to it. This band has incredible musical talent though, I would love an instrumental track. 
p941
aVOdd because I personally can't stand Bjorn (Strid, of Soilwork). Something just doesn't do it for me.\u000a\u000aEverfields isn't the best example of Juuka's versatility though... compared to The Unknowing, New World Shadows, or Who Could Say.
p942

aVBands evolve, nobody wants to hear the same record every time. Sure, if I could just get reroute to remain out of every album id be ok with that, but thats not creativity.\u000a\u000aI personally enjoy the new song, and hope the rest of the album is better. It had a lot of the elementa youd expect from in flames musically, and with the wonderful hook for the chorus.
p994
aVbands do evolve, but unlike what soilwork does. In Flames just strips down all that's good in their sound and replaces it with angsty teen lyrics and mediocre riffs.\u000a\u000abands evolve is a valid argument for what in flames does, it doesn't change the fact that they're evolving into radio rock.
p995
aVI can agree with that, especially since soilwork is my favorite band.
p996
aVSee there's a massive issue with this logic. Just because you stay in the same genre doesn't mean it sounds the same. That's why it's a genre. You wouldn't say Arch enemy sounds the same as at the gates which sounds the same as In Flames. They aren't even trying to be melodeath, or even anything that resembles a harder style of rock. They are literally going and doing exactly what the label wants them to do, and it sounds terrible.
p997
aV[deleted]
p998
aVNo mate no. And honestly no offense but 50% of the fans out there (so hundreds of thousands) are saying the EXACT SAME THING as you, often with the same phrasing. \u000a\u000aReally, you're kind of creating a strawman argument. \u000a\u000aWe don't want the same album done twice (I dont know why you mention Reroute as an album to get again as most early-In Flames fans see that as a shit album and the start of their downfall)  \u000a\u000aWe don't have a problem with evolution or progression. \u000a\u000aWhat we DO have a problem with is them watering down their music and writing, well...shit. \u000a\u000aRemember they pioneered a genre. Melodeath! This subreddit might not exist if it wasn't for In Flames and ATG &amp; DT (but I would argue mostly In Flames' influence). They brought true beauty into death metal with masterpieces like The Jester Race, Whoracle, Colony and Clayman!  And now they are turning their back on it completely and are becoming everything melodeath stood in opposition to. The bland, the generic, the uninspired, the non-refined, the simplistic, the immature. \u000a\u000aHonestly I would not care if In Flames became a folk band or jazz-fusion or country. As long as they did it with integrity and meaning. But instead they have compromised their own integrity releasing shit like this!
p999

aVAmusingly, the track has done the opposite for me. This is about the 4th time I've heard it, and I find myself closing the link earlier and earlier every time. \u000a\u000aIt's sad because In Flames and their album Jester Race is what got me into metal, but since Soundtrack to your Escape I haven't been able to find a single track to be excited about. Worse yet, after Sense of Purpose, I can't even find a single track that I can tolerate enough to finish. What I've heard from their upcoming album doesn't seem to buck that trend any for me either. I can respect that they keep trying something different and aren't afraid to change their sound, but in my opinion they've just gone in a direction that I no longer enjoy.
p1004
aV[deleted]
p1005
aVNope, I agree with you completely on Insomnium. I love Since the Day -- and I even like their stuff after it! -- but I past that album, well, everything sounds identical. Also, the production/mixing is awful on their albums. While I didn't mind when I first got into them, now I just can't listen to their stuff most of the time. It's too brickwalled.
p1006
aVAmusingly enough, I'm the same way, except for Come Clarity and after. Even though RTR and STYE are obviously inspired by "alternative metal," I still find them catchy and fun. I found A Sense of Purpose intolerable to listen to, although Playground was a little better (I still haven't touched it in months).
p1007
aVI know a lot of people love Clayman, but to me, Clayman was the start of the downward trend towards mediocrity. Colony was fantastic.
p1008
aVClayman is hit or miss for me in retrospect. I love more than half of the tracks, but unlike their previous work there were a few that I occasionally found myself skipping. 
p1009
aVHonestly Clayman is one of my favourite In Flames' albums. I can't pick between Jester Race, Whoracle, Colony or Clayman most the time but I do love Clayman because although it was HEADED towards the more mediocre direction, it didn't really show. Aside from Only For The Weak, the album was very much a solid and beautifully composed melodic death metal album that was an unrelentingly emotional journey. Satellites &amp; Astronauts transported me to a frame of mind where nothing matters- even your biggest mistake and regret and shame means nothing in the grand scheme of things; "buy me a trip to the moon, so I can laugh at my mistakes, you see I can see earth from here and from this perspective it looks kind of silly". But while that was relieving it also hammers in how insignificant you are which explains the very melancholic vibe of the piece.  \u000a Then the album rolls into what I believe is their most uplifting song of all time, Brush The Dust Away, which reminds you that you have a purpose, however minute, a purpose to progress and better yourself and unite with people to create a better tomorrow, in spite of the hiccups along the way and the fact that you doubt "it will all be worth it". And turn away from negativity and "bad intentions" and the somewhat apathy of humanity.  \u000a\u000aI think those two songs alone made Clayman masterful. Not just lyrically but sonically. Reroute To Remain was the real start of the downfall.

aVI agree with the other two guys, cleans need some work. They need to be cleaner and perhaps higher in pitch. Please have them fix this before releasing the final album. Be real with them and help them until it sounds good. They do sound like they have potential though. Also, the drumming could use a little more variation. I know it's too late for this album, but just for future reference.

Other not-well known albums I liked a lot were :\u000a\u000a"The Resillution" - Orpheus Omega\u000a\u000a"Psycotic Kingdom" - Harasai (starts slow but ramps up fast, imo)\u000a\u000a"The Gift of Life" - Dreamshade\u000a\u000a"Origin" - Enshine

aVAt first I was very very confused, but I should have seen the new sound coming, what with Sebastian toting around that 8-string.  Going to have to disagree with you about Manifesto and Bizarro World though, especially the latter.  Perhaps not as pure melodeath, but BW is actually my all time favorite album.  In general though, Deadlock are some seriously underrated metallers.

aVI realize I'm late to the party, but I was disappointed in how many of these albums *aren't* on youtube as a full album.  I spend most of my day listening to music on youtube, and I buy anything I listen to regularly -- the try-before-you-buy is why I own all the Insomnium albums and most of In Flames.  I'm still dithering over whether I like Soilwork and Agalloch enough to listen regularly.  But when I can't easily listen to it, I won't buy it.\u000a\u000aSo please, someone commit copyright violation and upload full albums (or, better yet, the band can create their own channel and upload).
p1094
aVI use [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) for any browsing needs. It basically has every artist ever in it, and pays the artist a [very small] amount of money per play. I don't know if its service is available in your country, but it works fine for most of the US and Europe.

aVIt wasn't clear to me whether Spotify had all the songs from a given album.  I really enjoy listening to albums end to end.  But I'll give it a whirl when I'm back at work.

I believe all the parts are there.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXOd9IhcQT0

aVBlack Dalhia murder's "Majesty" DvD documentary is one of my favorites to watch. Idk if you'd really call it melo-death though, but i love watching it. It's interesting to see a bunch of dudes in a brutal metal band act so down to earth and relatable. Worth checking out.

asVGreat French Melodeath (Designed &amp; Supported by Niklas Sundin)
p1148
(lp1149
VThanks for sharing! I really like (note: LOVE) melodeath but hearing the same types of vocals for the majority of bands in the genre gets a little boring, so its nice when a band can do what they do really well without having a singer doing vocals. Sometimes the music is enough to get the point of the song across. \u000a\u000aOne thing though: how can this be a one man band? Does he just like edit all the instrumental parts in or is he like a mutant with 8 arms? Either way this is awesome.
p1150
aVThere is a lot of one man, or even 2 men, band out there,  (e.g. Summoning or Caladan Brood)\u000a\u000aWhen a band record a LP/EP anyway, they all play one after another, usually starting with drums. A one man band don't do differently, but instead of rehearsing with multiple people and every instrument being played by someone different, he play them all (or program some in a music software)

(lp1271
VIf the person is completely averse to all genres of metal, then [Scar Symmetry - Ghost Prototype II-Deus Ex Machina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5aB9bW5B00).   
p1272
aVThis song was crazy awesome. It messed with my head.
p1273
aVCrikey.\u000aIs all their stuff like that?
p1274
aVMore or less. Varies in quality (imo Holographic Universe is their best album), especially when you consider the vocalist set up changes after it (from 1 spectacular talent to a pair of guys who are good in their own right, but didn't really hit their stride until their latest, The Singularity - Phase I - Neohumanity , which I am currently listening to), but in general it's the same idea. This song is a bit more accessible though.
p1275
aVI always thought the new guys' sound was pretty good, but the lyrical content seemed to have veered from somewhat scientific to outright insane topics such as reptilian people. Maybe I didn't get it. I think the Ghost Prototype songs have a lot more clean vocals than is usual for most Scar Symmetry songs too, right?
p1276
aVFrom what I remember (I stopped listening actively to them a while back, probably just overplayed it and got bored of the soundstyle that comes from Soilwork-y like bands, which according to your username is exactly your alley :P), yeah, the Ghost Prototype song does have a bit more cleans then most, although they use them a lot with the new pair of vocalists (since one does cleans and the other does the harsh ones, so they have to use them, you know?). But I'm no expect on the subject.\u000a\u000aLyrically, I have no idea - I usually gage a vocalists' success first hand on whether or not the lyrics musically match with the instruments (hint : loves Insomnium's Nillo Sevanen for that reason), and lyrics I google eventually if I REALLY love a song - so I can't say whether it's gotten better or worse.
p1277
aVIt's awesome to love a song for a long time, then google the lyrics and fall in love with it again. Every once in a while the song will actually not be as good once you find out the lyrics, but with MDM, it's nearly always better. It becomes a new song, in a way.

VWhile Ghost Brigade isn't really melodic death (can't recall this song off the top of my head, because it's not off the amazing *Isolation Songs*), it usually has some stylings that make it good to people who like the stuff (particularly if you like Insomnium and that style of more atmospheric, thoughtful melodic death).\u000a\u000aSons of Aeon (side-project of some Ghost Brigade members) fit the melodic death bill more but keep a similar sound, so take a look :P
p1310
aVI actually listen to Sons of Aeon already and really like them. \u000a\u000aYou are right about them not being melodeath though. Metal archives classifies them as Melodic death/ doom metal. I thought that the folks over here would like it though because of the melodeath elements that these guys have. 
p1311
aVThey may not be melodeath, but they still rock. I agree with your thought that people here would like it.
p1312
aVThey fall under Post-metal / Prog-metal according to [here](http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/band.php?band_id=3288&amp;bandname=Ghost%2BBrigade). Which works more imo. But they do have a sound that can be familiar to melodeath guys, especially Insomnium fans (since Aleksi Munter worked with both bands on their albums on keyboards, the sound is very similar when you pay attention).

aVThanks man! I already listen to Omnium Gatherum, Insomnium, Enshine, Be'lakor, Lunarsea, and Sons of Aeon, and love them all. I listened to a little bit of the Dawn of Solace song that you posted and I really like it!

aVThank you for this list. I'm a fan of Be'lakor and Insomnium and will check the rest of these out.
p1323
aVDo yourself a favor and add Dark Tranquillity and Words of Farewell if you like both Insomnium and Be'Lakor (and I'm going to presume Omnium Gatherum - although for them, focus more on "New World Shadows" and "Beyond")
p1324
aVAlready familiar with Dark Tranquillity. New World Shadows and Beyond are both effing awesome. I'm going to cautiously check out their earlier discography as well.
p1325
aVEarlier Omnium is a bit special. Redshift is similar to NWS, but more sporadic and proggy, without the same consistency. Worth a look, but keep expectation tempered.\u000a\u000aEarlier OG have a very high pitch growler, so if you like the harsh growls you might not enjoy it that much. However, musically, Spirit and August Lights (or whatever it is) is very good. I just can't stand the old vocalist they had.

aVFor some reason I thought it was Nillo + Ville, but you're right, OttS is Markus + Ville. Markus wrote Promethean Song, Revelations, part of this and part of The River (with Nillo).

p1426
aVI thought they last album had a noticeable change in style. They were definitely going for a more classic metal sound. I wonder if they will continue that trend.
p1427
aVEh like you said, I'm sure we'll all enjoy it.  Can't complain about a band producing quality melodic death metal.  I loved Surtur Rising, everything about that album kicks ass.  DOTG was kind of meh, but I mean a lot of the songs are still really catchy and you can headbang to em or play drums or guitar to them from time to time.  Great live album as well.  \u000a\u000a\u000aI'd be fucking thrilled to see a return to the style of "Once sent from the Golden Hall" or "sorrow throughout the nine worlds", but I doubt that will ever happen.\u000a\u000aI'm also kind of confident that when these dudes eventually retire, they're going to go on a huge tour like they did in 2011 or for Bloodshed over Bochum and play tons of material from their old albums.  So that's always something to look forwards to, even if you don't like any of the new stuff.  \u000a\u000a
p1428
aVEven if their sound is somewhat similar across their albums (although I think it has become more accessible to the less seasoned metal listener), I really enjoy how the lyrical content has evolved. He's a great story teller and I'm excited about a new album.
p1429
aVThere's always 1-2 tracks on the back end of their albums that really showcase this well I think.\u000a\u000aI think they do a good job of mixing making money with writing music with "substance" if that makes sense.

p1437

p1438
aVAnd Miseration. 
p1439
aVIt's not like it on all tracks but this one in particular is a good example as to why I dislike the new singers. There's so much unnecessary effects and weird techniques used in here. Like between 0:25 and 0:33. Are those weird cleans really necessary?\u000a\u000aEven though old scar symmetry did weird stuff here and there it just feels like they take it over the top way too often when Christian left.\u000a\u000aKeep it simple I guess is my point.

VNice to see another person appreciating The Arcane Order. \u000a\u000aThe Wake of Collisions is one of the best melodic death albums of all time.
p1477
aVI know right? There definitely one of the lesser known giants of MDM, up there with other awesome groups like Insomnium, Be'lakor, and Omnium Gatherum.\u000a\u000aI really was hoping to find Death is Imminent though. That song is absolutely brutal. Love it.
p1478
aVHey, you posted something from my YT channel! This song is under-heard, so I'm glad you posted it.

VIt says right in the description that it's Doom Metal.\u000a\u000aI mean, I like myself some doom, and I have this album on my "to listen to eventually" list, but this is definitely not melodeath so I'm not sure why it's here...
p1484
aVI think this can be considered melodic death metal
p1485
aVSo you haven't even listened to it, and you're genre policing it? 
p1486
aVI've listened to another one of their albums before, Saturn in Ascension. I clipped this one for a few clips and it sounded up the doom alley as well.
p1487
aVI'm not saying this is melodeath or not, but you do know bands often change genres from album to album, right?
p1488
aVJesus, way to dig back in the archives ;P\u000a\u000aThere are some bands that do change genres, but to say that happens often wouldn't be something I would agree with, from the experience I know. There are some tweaks perhaps in how they approach the sound, but bands more often then not stay in the same genre limits.\u000a\u000aIt's not impossible that they change genres between albums, but I wouldn't say often either. From the myriad of bands I listen to, there are very few who outright change.
p1489
aVWell, my 3 favorite bands somehow did. Empyrium started with Gothic/Doom metal, all dark and kvltish in its music quality. That was only an EP, though. The following album had electric guitars, yes, and it sounded similar to some avant-garde doom metal mixture with rock. Following albums were mostly acoustic German neofolk. Ulver has had so many genres that I'm not going to mention them all. It has had a purely electronic era, black metal, acoustic neofolk, rock and whatnot. And Haggard, my absolute favorite band, started with progressive death metal and progressed into a mixture of classical music and symphonic death metal. \u000a\u000aSuper popular bands tend not to change because the fans want that kind of music. It would be unthinkable for Arch Enemy to suddenly release a jazz album, or Nightwish to start playing black metal with synths (Dimmu Borgir style).\u000a\u000aI'm not saying it's most bands either. It's many times already have I opened a YT video thinking I'm going to find some instrument playing in some tone and I get surprised with some other completely different thing. There was, for example, a Spanish pop group that I loved so much that an album of theirs was the only one that I kept for a bit more than a decade. I always listened to it, but I realized that they probably had a lot more music than that album, so I downloaded the discography and listened to their starting tracks. It's 80s disco music. Aqua released a song recently, I was thinking it was some more barbie girl or candyman styled music, but it was a lot darker and serious, and it was some helluva surprise for me (I'm talking about the track My Momma Said).\u000a\u000aSo yeah, you're right in that it's not most, it's not half, it's just some minority of the music artists in the world, but it's a significant amount of bands and I think that you can't just assume that because some guys played doom metal before it's unthinkable that they might release melodeath afterward.\u000a\u000aStill, I'm not saying it's melodeath or not. I haven't listened past the second track.

(lp1562
V**At the Gates**: I'd recommend Slaughter of the Soul and their new album, At War With Reality. ATG is also one of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands.\u000a\u000a**Be'lakor**: I'd recommend all 3 albums; The Frail Tide, Stone's Reach, and Of Breath and Bone.\u000a\u000a**Before the Dawn**: I'd recommend their [entire discography](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Before_the_Dawn/8508). Really solid, standard Melodic Death Metal. While they disbanded, Tuomas Saukkonen started a new band, Wolfheart, that preserved a lot of how Before the Dawn sounds.\u000a\u000a**Blackguard**: I'd recommend both of their albums, Profugus Mortis and Firefight. They're a pretty fun Melodic Death/Folk Metal band.\u000a\u000a**Blood Stain Child**: An interesting band that somehow fuses Melodic Death Metal and Trance of all things. I've only really given their album [Epsilon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vobp17bP17c) a listen, but it's really fucking good stuff.\u000a\u000a**Carcass**: I'd recommend Heartwork and their newest release, Surgical Steel.\u000a\u000a**Children of Bodom**: I haven't given them an extensive listen, but I know Children of Bodom is all sorts of fun Melodic Death/Power Metal.\u000a\u000a**Dark Tranquillity**: One of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands. I'd recommend Haven, Damage Done, Character, Fiction, We Are the Void, and Construct. Mikael Stann\u000a\u000a**Disarmonia Mundi**: I'd recommend Fragments of D-Generation, Mind Tricks (+re-release), The Isolation Game, and The Restless Memoirs (EP). Soilwork's Bjorn Strid did a ton of vocals for this band.\u000a\u000a**Eternal Tears of Sorrow**: I've only listened to their album, Saivon Lapsi, but their entire discography seems good to me.\u000a\u000a**The Few Against Many**: Their sole album, SOT, is incredible, especially because they have Christian Alvestam on vocals.\u000a\u000a**Hypocrisy**: I'd recommend Abducted, The Final Chapter, Hypocrisy, Into the Abyss, Catch 22, The Arrival, Virus, A Taste of Extreme Divinity, and End of Disclosure. Hypocrisy is one of my absolute favorite bands that definitely emphasizes the Death Metal part of Melodic Death Metal, as well as Peter Tagtgren's vocals being fucking awesome.\u000a\u000a**In Flames**: One of the pioneering Melodic Death Metal bands. I'd recommend The Jester Race, Black-Ash Inheritance, Whoracle, Colony, Clayman, Reroute to Remain, Soundtrack to Your Escape, and Come Clarity. In Flames was one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal.\u000a\u000a**Insomnium**: The fan favorite of this subreddit, and one of the best Melodic Death Metal bands currently. I'd recommend [their entire discography.](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Insomnium/2332)\u000a\u000a**Kalmah**: I'd recommend [their entire discography.](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Kalmah/702)\u000a\u000a**Ka\u0308lter**: I'd recommend both albums, Spiritual Angel and Ubuntu.\u000a\u000a**Mercenary**: I'd recommend 11 Dreams, The Hours That Remain, Architect of Lies, and Metamorphosis. \u000a\u000a**Mnemic**: I've only listened to Sons of the System, but Mnemic overall seems good.\u000a\u000a**Mors Principium Est**: I'd recommend Inhumanity, The Unborn, Liberation = Termination, and ...And Death Said Live.\u000a\u000a**Omnium Gatherum**: I'd recommend The Redshift, New World Shadows, and Beyond. \u000a\u000a**Parasite Inc.**: I'd recommend their sole album, Time Tears Down.\u000a\u000a**Raintime**: I'd recommend Tales From Sadness, Flies &amp; Lies, and Psychromatic.\u000a\u000a**Satariel**: I'd recommend Hydra, and White Ink: Chapter One.\u000a\u000a**Scar Symmetry**: I'd recommend Symmetric in Design, Pitch Black Progress, Holographic Universe, Dark Matter Dimensions, The Unseen Empire, and The Singularity (Phase I - Neohumanity). After Holographic Universe, they parted ways with Christian Alvestam, and picked up Lars Palmqvist and Roberth Karlsson (note: TWO VOCALISTS) to replace him. Scar Symmetry was one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal.\u000a\u000a**Shade Empire**: While Shade Empire is a mixture of a lot of genres, I'd highly recommend Omega Arcane.\u000a\u000a**Skyfire**: I'd recommend their entire discography. I haven't given Skyfire an extensive listen, but it's good.\u000a\u000a**Soilwork**:  I'd recommend A Predator's Portrait, Natural Born Chaos, Figure Number Five, Stabbing the Drama, Sworn to a Great Divide, The Panic Broadcast, and The Living Infinite. Soilwork is one of the bands that got me into Melodic Death Metal, and Bjorn Strid's vocals are amazing.\u000a\u000a**Solution .45**: I'd recommend their sole album, For Aeons Past. Christian Alvestam is the vocalist. I don't have to say anymore, really.\u000a\u000a**Sonic Syndicate**: I'd recommend Eden Fire, Only Inhuman, and Love and Other Disasters. \u000a\u000a**Starkill**: I'd recommend Virus of the Mind, I haven't listened to much else, but it's good.\u000a\u000a**The Stranded**: I'd recommend their sole album, Survivalism Boulevard. Both members of Disarmonia Mundi are in this band.\u000a\u000a**Swallow the Sun**: I'd recommend their entire discography.\u000a\u000a**This Cold Life**: I'd recommend Ascent of the Fallen, and Fallacy.\u000a\u000a**Torchbearer**: I'd recommend Death Meditations, as I haven't listened to much else. Contains Christian Alvestam and Satariel vocalist, Par Johansson.\u000a\u000a**Universum**: I'd recommend Leto Destinatus, and Mortuus Machina. Christian Alvestam does guest vocals on a few tracks on Mortuus Machina. Surely you see a trend by now.\u000a\u000a**Wintersun**: I'd recommend Wintersun, and Time I.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I might get around to adding links, we'll see.
p1563
aVWell, that's definitely the essentials. Listening to The Gallery (Dark Tranquility), The Jester Race (In Flames) and Slaughter of the Soul (At the Gates) is definitely a "must" since those 3 albums are some of the most influential.\u000a\u000aOh and for Children of Bodom, pick and choose amongst their most popular songs from Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper. They're my favorite band, but only some of their songs really appeal to melodeath fans

aVInsomnium is my favorite. Closely followed by Omnium Gatherum (they now share a guitarist because the one from Insomnium needed to focus on being a doctor?). Fractal Gates. Before the Dawn. Wolfheart. If you like Heaven Shall Burn you'll probably like Caliban and Bleed the Sky even though I don't think any of them are MDM. Also Mnemic. Be'lakor  (spelling?) - some of their stuff is a little weird to me but in the same song it can do a 180 and be completely awesome. Thinking of track 1 on album "of breath and bone". Scar Symmetry (apparently have a brand new album out and I was unaware). Solution .45. Kalmah are good like someone else said already (little too folky for me but still good). Hypocrisy is ok but has a really really good song here and there (Erased, Fire in the Sky, maybe one or two more are my absolute favorites). Soilwork - actually eased me into MDM from American nu metal, post hardcore and metal core with album "figure number five" everything before that is more thrash and most stuff after is more melodic.\u000a\u000aTrying to think here.\u000a\u000aMaybe: Mors Principium Est?\u000a\u000aHope that has helped. I like a lot of music, MDM is my favorite though.\u000a\u000aEdit: can't believe I forgot Dark Tranquility! They aren't in any current play lists but the first time I heard "ThereIn" it blew my mind.\u000a\u000aI would say At The Gates, Caracas or In Flames but I think MDM has completely changed since they started it. In Flames is still around and are now what I call "pop metal" lol.

aVWow it's hard to recommend because simply defining what melodic death metal is can be very polarizing. Essentially melodic death can have keyboards but don't necessarily have to have them. Most have clean vocals but not all. Music has to be either bouncy or catchy but still heavy and fun. Opeth I would not consider melodeath because some songs are just acoustic for the first half of the song so don't really fit in for me as a band that I can just put on and be a catchy, fun listening experience. \u000a\u000aHowever here are some in order of being more established and well known down to newer acts that deserve a listen. \u000a\u000a**Dark tranquillity** (no clean vocals on older stuff, give both 'character' and 'fiction' a listen) \u000a\u000a**In flames** (people will always say 'their older stuff is better, but I disagree there's some great stuff just skip the last two albums LOL) \u000a\u000a**Soilwork** (the third of the three main melodeath bands to listen to. They consistently put out quality material) \u000a\u000a\u000aThe following are IMO Norwegian sounding bands.\u000a\u000a**Kalmah** (for the revolution) \u000a\u000a**Norther** - (N) \u000a\u000a**Insefirum** - (from afar) \u000a\u000a**Wintersun** - (Wintersun) \u000a\u000a**Skyfire** -  (mind revolution) \u000a\u000a \u000aTHE MELODEATH YOU SHOULD KNOW\u000a\u000a**Scar Symmetry** - pitch black progress + dark matter dimensions \u000a\u000a**Solution 45** - for aeons past (Christian alvestam supergroup) \u000a\u000a**The unguided** - fragile immortality \u000a\u000a**Threat Signal** - (threat signal) \u000a\u000a**Borealis** - (fall from grace) \u000a\u000a**MyGrain**- MyGrain \u000a\u000a**Rise to Fall** - restore the balance \u000a\u000a**Disarmonia Mundi** -  fragments of D-Generation \u000a\u000a**I legion** - Beyond darkness \u000a\u000a**Sybreed** - Antares \u000a\u000a**Before the dawn** - deathstar rising\u000a\u000a**Mercenary** - the hours that remain\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSome good alternatives that lean towards power metal or deathcore. \u000a\u000a**Allegaeon** - formshifter \u000a\u000a**Imperanon** - Stained \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBands with Girl singers:\u000a\u000a**In this moment**\u000a\u000a**The Agonist**\u000a

I would also strongly recommend checking out their early works with their very first vocalist, since they do have quite a few solid tracks there.\u000a\u000a**Blinded Colony** - This is quite an odd group since they're a Christian band (or they were at some point before changing their name to "The Blinded" because none of the original members of the group were left), but I would still recommend listening to Bedtime Prayers because it sounds good on its own merits and sounds quite secular as a whole (especially compared to their Divine release, which is very definitely a Christian album, despite how the music sounds heavier overall).\u000a\u000a**Children of Bodom** - In my experience, a lot of their tracks might sound a bit samey or hard to distinguish from one another (although I haven't heard their latest release), but they do have some very good songs if you know where to look. I'd advise listening to tracks like Lake Bodom, Sixpounder, Bed of Razors, or Needled 24/7 before you decide to check them out extensively by albums.\u000a\u000a**Dark Tranquility** - A classic group. If you're looking to get into them, I suggest checking out Damage Done, Character, and Fiction first.\u000a\u000a**Deadlock** - Really good group with female vocalist. In my opinion, Manifesto is their magnum opus album (and also happens to be quite diverse in some ways). I cannot recommend it enough.\u000a\u000a**Dimension Zero** - Really thrashy and rough sounding, but you might really like them. I would check out Silent Night Fever if you can listen to it.\u000a\u000a**Disarmonia Mundi** - One of the greatest groups of melodic death metal. They have so much great work under their belt that it's easier for me to recommend you skip their Nebularium release altogether and check out anything else in their discography. They also did a few tracks on Princess Ghibli, a collection of metal covers of Miyazaki songs. If you start listening to them, you should probably know that they are already working on a new album that will be out early 2015.\u000a\u000a**In Flames** - A very good group, but some of their work is hit or miss. They really changed a lot over the years. I would advise skipping their latest release entirely.\u000a\u000a**Mercenary** - Amazing Danish melodic death metal group with a lot of power metal influences here or there. Be sure to check out 11 Dreams, The Hours That Remain, Architect of Lies, and Metamorphosis.\u000a\u000a**Mnemic** - Another amazing Danish band. A lot of fans contend that their first album is very different and superior to their later work, but the only song I've heard from their earliest album was Liquid, and I did think it was a good track. The Audio Injected Soul is a must-listen if you check this group out. I also recommend Passenger and Sons of the System if you decide to keep listening to them. I would advise skipping Mnemesis, however.\u000a\u000a**Omnium Gatherum** - I've only heard New World Shadows and Beyond so far, and judging from those albums I would highly recommend checking them out. They really have wonderful instrumentals and some of their music is surprisingly quite soothing.\u000a\u000a**Scar Symmetry** - Most fans contend that Holographic Universe will always be their best album, but I would suggest checking that out along with Pitch Black Progress. After Holographic Universe, the original vocalist left the band and they released two albums that sounded okay for what they are, but did not compare to their first albums. Their latest release, however, sounds like the new group's attempt to redo Holographic Universe, but it is still well-made and worth listening to.\u000a\u000a**Soilwork** - My gateway melodic death metal band. Will always hold a special place in my heart. Their first few albums are very rough around the edges, but easy to like if you're looking for something on the heavier side. Despite what people say about their works after Natural Born Chaos (Figure Number Five, Stabbing the Drama), they are still worth checking out. Also be sure to check out The Panic Broadcast and The Living Infinite. You could probably skip Sworn To A Great Divide and not miss out on much, as that was probably their most underwhelming album.\u000a\u000a**Solution .45** - They only have one album out at the moment and they're a band by Christian Alvestam, the former vocalist of Scar Symmetry. I honestly think that if you are used to how he sounds in Scar Symmetry, then the album will take some time to grow on you, but it is worth it. I also believe they have a new release coming sometime in 2015, so now's a great time to start listening to them.\u000a\u000a**Sonic Syndicate** - I've only really heard Only Inhuman and Love And Other Disasters so far, but I would still suggest those albums at the very least.\u000a\u000a**Universum** - I've only listened to Mortuus Machina, but that was because a friend of mine a few years ago told me that Christian Alvestam was doing guest vocals on a few of the tracks. Not sure about their other works.\u000a\u000a**Wintersun** - Stuff of legends. They only have two albums at the moment, but they are definitely worth every second of your time listening to them.

aVThe Duskfall are an excellent, if mostly unknown, band. They recently got back together after six and a bit years and put out a new album, which is excellent.
p1579
aVI'd reccomend checking out:\u000a\u000aMiseration- More straight up death metal but still very melodic and extremely catchy. Favorite album is Your Demons= Their Angels. Christian Alvestams on vocals too.\u000a\u000aBlack Sun Aeon- One of Tuomas Saukonnens side projects. More doom but still extremely good.\u000a\u000aDawn of Solace- Another one of Saukonnens side projects that only has one extremely good album.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVSame.\u000a\u000aAny band that can be around that long with so many lineup changes and *still* put out their (arguably) best album to date...as a double album...seriously fucking impressive.  The entire album is a win.\u000a\u000aThese guys are **CRIMINALLY** underappreciated. 
p1651
aVYep. Love that whole album and I'd say it's their best yet - which is saying something considering they don't have an album I don't love.\u000a\u000aGot to see them live shortly after the album came out. It was one hell of a show. Caught one of Dirk's drumsticks.
p1652
aVFuckin A man.  Yup been a fan from the start, and anyone that dismisses their new albums are just those basement dwelling old-school metal elitists.  Bjorn's vocals have only gotten better and better, as the flow of the instrumentals have as well.  It could be argued that some of the chops and solos have been degraded since the chainheart era, etc - but I honestly love their stylings on every single album, Peter Wichers or not.  \u000a\u000aBands need to start utilizing head voice and bluesy/manly singing.  It is insane how few bands utilize it (KSE, these guys, He is Legend, and I guess you could say In Flames) are really some of the only bands that come to mind.  It's sickening.  So many bands think that they need to sing like chicks to sound clean.  Bands like Periphery and BTBAM do it well without this type of singing, but still - it's shocking and sad how few bands use Bjorn's stylings.
p1653
aVWhat does it for me is the fact that they still have the same type of sound but it just gets immensely better with every album. \u000a\u000aI only wish In Flames had evolved like soilwork has, but they make the music they like, and so they should. Just my personal hopes and thoughts wish they were like their older stuff.
p1654
aVI'm of the opinion they have evolved, but I know not every In Flames fan shares that opinion. Mainly I like that over the recent albums there's more singing, and I find a lot of their newer metal uplifting/gets me pumped up/motivated (A Sense of Purpose). \u000a\u000aI started with Clayman / Reroute to Remain, and genuinely like their newer stuff better. It all boils down to what niches of metal do it for a person, the nuances keep changing as new albums come and go. 
p1655
aVI actually think that Anders has a really good singing voice, but his growls are part of what made In Flames awesome back in the day. 
p1656
aVWhat bands are you referring to actually have Speed-style clean (but powerful) vocals? I've been listening to Soilwork nonstop for ages now, and seriously wish the same thing, that more metal bands would try this. \u000a\u000aI keep seeing "nobody listens to metal for the lyrics/vocals" but Speed has absolutely spoiled me and ruined metal in a lot of ways for me. I practically demand vocals now as good as his, in addition to awesome metal. \u000a\u000aAnyway, the few other bands that come to mind for me, that have clean but manly singing (that are also my favorites) - Before the Dawn and Scar Symmetry / Solution 45. In Flames of course too. I'm guessing KSE = Killswitch Engage? Love his voice too, and fully agree. \u000a\u000aGrowling mostly doesn't do anything for me anymore, thanks Speed. \u000a\u000aEDIT: Vesta seriously just popped up in my 37 favorite metal-workout songs playlist on shuffle, while browsing this thread, also I forgot to give a mention to Mercenary - adding to the clean/power vocals list.
p1657
aVI'd say check out He is Legend. Much different type of music perhaps - but has a great bluesy and manly rasp that I love so kinda like Jesse Leach a bit. Just as underutilized as headvoice IMO, except by a few southern metal bands which a lot of times are just really boring anyway, but HIL is one of my favs.  It Hates You was one of the best "crossover" metal albums ever recorded.  Incredibly underrated band. I WISH I knew of more bands that used headvoice like speed. I couldn't even think of any. Its a damn shame.  I'll have to check out the ones you recommended, although I already liked Scar Symmetry.  
p1658
aVHoly crap, you'll probably love Before the Dawn, and thanks for the reply! I have to give HiL a try now, doing that atm. For a good starting BTD song, I recommend Deathstar Rising, their lead singer does a bit of (good) growling but there's a lot of good chorus clean singing in between. \u000a\u000aThomas Saukkonen also looks exactly like fucking Kratos from God of War too, so there's that. 
p1659
aVTuomas*

aVCheck out myGRAIN. Their vocalist sounds almost exactly like Speed
p1662
aVLet the first wave rise is still on top for me...
p1663
aVThere's not a bad song on the album. But Vesta and Parasite Blues are my two favorite. Was glad when they opened with Parasite Blues when I saw them last year.
p1664
aVI deeply love soilwork. I've been to the last several concerts they've had in St. Louis and I've discovered Speed is a pretty cool guy. He posed for pictures and hung out with us after a show. Great guy. \u000a\u000aI started listening when Figure Number Five came out and have been well pleased ever since. It is rare for me to find a new band that I can enjoy as much as soilwork. I've really become a fan of both styles of vocals present, rather than just one or the other. Sometimes I find bands that had what I was looking for such as Into Eternity's two albums "Buried in Oblivion" and "Dead or Dreaming" but then lineup changes change the sound too much. \u000a\u000aAnyone else here know what I mean?

p1693
aVThe difference between the comments here and r/metal is pretty stark. A lot of hate there for it. \u000a\u000aTo say I'm excited is an understatement. 
p1694
aVMelodeath is a genre a lot of metalheads seem to either like or heavily dislike. When you consider it's been around for 20 years without much significant evolution (although I'd argue the new wave of the 2000's built by Insomnium, Be'Lakor, and Damage Done-to-Fiction-era Dark Tranquillity). It's a genre that's full of acts trying to be the next "At The Gates" or "In Flames" and being heavily inspired there. It's a genre that can also - at times - be extremely close to metalcore (we all know how people feel there).\u000a\u000aBasically, it's an old genre that has a sound that's pretty token but has not seen significant growth, and people who loved it back then have arguably tired of it. Most find modern melodic death releases to be "Repetitive, I've heard this before, I'll just go back to The Gallery/Jester Race/Slaughter of the Soul". So I'm not surprised that r/metal isn't a huge fan of this, compared to the people who are still into that particular sound.
p1695
aVThat's definitely a cohesive argument. It's just a shame really. I favour melodeath over most other sub-genres. But everyone has their own opinion and that's fine. 
p1696
aVReally good!  Can't wait for the whole album

asVOne of the best melodeath songs I've heard all year. Fallujah - Sapphire
p1721
(lp1722
VMore prog death then melo death, but it's a common confusion (probably because a lot of the bigger melodeath names take inspiration from Edge of Sanity and Opeth, that are prog death but have a similar sound to melo death, so their influence spreads). That said, it's a genre that can be appreciated by the heavier melodeath listeners (as I am).\u000a\u000aAlso arguably tech because those drums sound like tech stuff.\u000a\u000aOther then that it's actually a ~~really solid~~ great song.
p1723
aVI think Melo death could (should?) be considered a blanket genre. For instance the Finnish style MDM (CoB, Norther, MPE) has a lot of power metal influences and a different vocal style, while Gothenborg MDM is more influenced by NWoBHM and old school DM.\u000a\u000aWhen you go a bit more to the edges, where the lines become blurrier, a lot of Folk-metal bands (e.g. Ensiferum, Equilibrium, Eluveitie) could also fall under the monniker MDM. The same for some progmetal bands like Persefone and Kalisia.\u000a
p1724
aVI agree that it covers a wide range of stuff, but there are differences between progressive (which this song is, for example, or Opeth or Ne Obliviscaris) and the melodic death's (In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, At The Gates). Those differences are fairly nuanced and have lost their "definitive line" over time, however. For example, some stuff that is metalcore can be considered by some as melodeath. There's a difference between the two that is obvious to those who know where to look (listen?).\u000a\u000aOne could say that CoB, MPE and Norther belong to "extreme power" (referring to the power metal influences and the extreme vocal style) rather then melodic death, for example. Eluveitie is more or less MDM with folk elements (they sound so similar to Dark Tranquillity in too many places) while I can't vouch for the other 2 (don't listen to them). For Persefone - at least Spiritual Migration - it is close to both, but I would still define that album as a prog death album (but it's close).\u000a\u000aIn this particular song though, it's very tech-y and proggy to the point where it's that with some atmosphere. That's not what is going to make it melodic death. A lot of prog death can be awfully close sounding to melodeath too (Opeth's "My Arms Your Hearse" album, Edge of Sanity's "Crismon" are the main examples), due to them having such an influence on the genre as a whole.\u000a\u000aI mean - good music is good music - don't get me wrong. I like the melodeath, progdeath, doom, death among others, but I also know some of those don't necessarily belong here rather then in another sub.
p1725
aVThis is one of my favorites on the album.  The solos on this album are all so mindblowing.

aVThe ambience and technical melodies blew me away when i first heard this. I'd never liked tech death before this song.

asVShade Empire - Omega Arcane (Full Album)

p1731
aVShade Empire falls under both MeloDeath and Symphonic Black Metal. They're definitely rocking the dark, atmospheric sound that comes from more symphonic sub-genres. SE is awesome.
p1732
aVTo me, this band sounds like a happy combination of Two Steps from Hell, Septic Flesh, and Dethklok. But I can also see similar styles in Ne Obliviscaris. All amazing in their own right, but Shade Empire seems to take key elements from each of those bands and make something completely unique, yet recognizable. The masterfully interwoven moments of orchestration are what really set this album apart from other MDM bands, imho.

They have four albums (soon to be 5!), each of which has a different tone and style, but still sounds like the same band. \u000a\u000aHypocrisy also has a really explorable discography.\u000a\u000aI dunno what bands you already know, but if you don't know them, Dark Tranquillity is a must.

VI won't lie I much prefer Johan Liiva's vocals to those of Angela Gossow. Sure he sounds more like L.G. Petrov on Wolverine Blues with more of a hardcorish shout but over the next few albums his vocals got better. Also the music just felt more memorable on those first releases!
p1878
aVI had no idea Arch Enemy was this good before Angela. Looks like another discography I'll be listening to 
p1879
aVYeah I was kind of surprised to see so few posts about the era with their first vocalist when I did a search on here. I guess they got far more popular after he left though but some of the comments on the video are pretty funny. A lot of current fans don't seem to be aware there was even a vocalist or albums before Angela joined the band.

VLove MDM more than anything.\u000a\u000aBut I also love Techical/Progressive Death Metal, Folk Metal, (K)Pop, Hardstyle, (Hard) Dance, (Progressive) House, Blues and Classical.
p1909
aVI'm into stuff like Bad Religion and Rise Against.  I've also been getting into Alestorm.
p1910
aVMailnly folk metal. Besides that things like Katatonia and Opeth, some doom and prog metal and my guilty pleasure is electropop.
p1911
aVSaw Katatonia and Opeth on tour together. It was amazing.  Katatonia won me over big time.
p1912
aVLove the fuck out of Djent/Prog.
p1913
aVI do love me some djent.
p1914
aVPost-rock, Indie, Post-metal, Progrock and sometimes even hiphop
p1915
aVMe, I love black metal. And other subgenres with a couple of them that I don't listen to. Outside of metal, I love jazz and post rock 
p1916
aVI like trap music.\u000a\u000a[Like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KMOLrAqYZQ) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-xKHSH8ALQ)\u000a\u000a\u000aHere's a badass [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLgxQbXzbco) that sounds like sonic the hedgehog.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt's also really melodic.
p1917
aVI went through a phase where I listened to nothing but [Caravan Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7lxd7RL1To) for a few months
p1918
aVI can dig it.
p1919
aVPower metal (really, any type of metal). Older pop (ABBA) and country. Classical. Some punk (Bad Religion, Rage Against). J-Pop, J-Rock. Trance and some types of electro. Videogame music, especially 8- and 16-bit tracks. Ambient.
p1920
aVNever heard of Rage Against.\u000aWait a sec... Lol
p1921
aVFor metal I'm a huge fan of death, grindcore, symphonic, doom, tech death, gothic, some groove, and a little prog.\u000a\u000aIn broader strokes, I'm a huge fan of jazz, orchestral and classical music, classic rock, instrumental rock, and blues.
p1922
aVHardcore. Melodic Hardcore. Gabber. Minimal. Dad Rock.
p1923
aVMDM has recently gotten me into medieval folk music. This album whole is catchy as fuck https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr8d9sXioj4
p1924
aVI love it!
p1925
aVI'm guessing you listen to a lot of folk metal
p1926
aVActually I've just begun listening to folk metal more actively.  My favorite so far is Eluveitie.
p1927
aVInstrumental indie music along with &lt;1950's jazz and blues. Then of course classic rock and other metal genres.
p1928
aVGenerally i don't limit myself to any genre and i don't mind mainstream music. if the music is nice i will listen to it. But I mainly love MDM/Folk/Heavy metal and Trance\u000a\u000a
p1929
aVThrash is a second for me, after MDM. Then there's Industrial, Black, prog, tech-death and Doom.
p1930
aVMetal subgenres; melodic metalcore, some hardcore.\u000a\u000aOtherwise; Orchestral, alternative, a capella, classic rock
p1931
aVDeath metal is my main sub genre, then melodeath and sludge come after. Toss random artists from other genres into the mix and you've got an idea of what music I have on my phone.
p1932
aVMy closest favourite behind MDM is Technical Death Metal, or most Technical / Progressive forms of metal really. I'm not really a fan of the stereotypical 'djent' style of Progressive though, with a few exceptions like Animals as Leaders - while they were instrumental (hehe) in pioneering the sound they go above and beyond it too.\u000a\u000aI really dig bands like Son of Aurelius, The Black Dahlia Murder, Inferi and Revocation. Some people name this Technical Melodic Death Metal but I think that's getting waaaay to specific. :)\u000a\u000aBranching out more I've also been getting into Black Metal and it's related subgenres like Atmospheric Metal lately. If it's dark and brooding with pagan themes or influence, I'm down.\u000a\u000aBut going outside of metal, I love me some EDM. Savant, Koan Sound, glitchy stuff like that I like in particular. Don't tell anyone but Trap music just gets me for some reason. So fucking *turnt*\u000a\u000aI'm also big on folk music, particularly Irish. I can play a tin whistle and a Bodhran.
p1933
aVAlternative Rock and Deathcore mainly:\u000a\u000aBreaking Benjamin, Thousand Foot Krutch, Skillet, Suicide Silence and Whitechapel are a few bands from these two genres
p1934
aVMetal-core, jazz, classic and ballads
p1935
aVProg, Doom/stoner, Technical Death, regular Death, classic, prog, and alternative rock and classical music.
p1936
aVAmericana. I love old sounding bands like Old Crow Medicine Show, Punch Brothers, or Trampled by Turtles. There's something about pure acoustic music with a nice upbeat feel and a catchy melody to sing along with. It's happy music. 
p1937
aVTechnical Death Metal\u000aMetalcore\u000aBlack Metal\u000aSymphonic * Metal\u000aNu Metal
p1938
aVProgressive Death Metal and Power Metal are some of my other favorites.
p1939
aVMelodic death is my favorite subgenre of metal. But I'm a fan of other ones like folk metal, doom/cyber metal, prog metal, metalcore, and even nu metal.\u000a\u000aIn other genres outside metal, I'm a fan of some rap like Tech N9ne, Dark Lotus, and ICP. In addition, I seem to have a soft spot for some hard/alt rock.
p1940
aVI really enjoy EDM like Knife Party, Zedd, and Krewella, and rap like Immortal Technique, and Childish Gambino.
p1941
aVPower Metal
p1942
aVDammit, got here too late to be in on the action.\u000a\u000aI've enjoyed death, progdeath, doom, power (more symphonic or atmospheric, usually), prog, thrash, post. Usually having some elements similar to the MDM stuff I like (atmosphere, melody, pacing, etc...).
p1943
aVbasically everything.
p1944
aVHardcore, melodic hardcore, metalcore, deathcore, grindcore, black metal (especially symphonic) and if we go further afield, I love rap, indie and neo-classical (fuck yeah Emilie Autumn).
p1945
aVAside from Melodic Death Metal, I like Doom Metal, Black Metal, Atmospheric Black Metal, Technical Death Metal and Death Metal. Some Classical (mainly Archangelo Corelli) and Neoclassical (Emilie Autumn - Laced/Unlaced) is good, but in general, the further a genre strays from Metal, the less I like it. I absolutely cannot stand pop, electronic, rap, hip-hop, rock, etc. It makes my skin crawl.

These guys are fast...
p1988
aVWanted to come back and post a thanks for posting this. The sci-fi metal title caught my eye last week, gave them a shot, and I REALLY like them. Youtube has entries for a few of their albums in their entirety and seamless, and I've played them start to finish many times. I know this post is a little old, but I felt you deserved some thanks and credit. \u000a\u000aAforementioned links: \u000a[Xenon](http://youtu.be/rWiZf6mCYfs)\u000a[Empyrean](http://youtu.be/58s3pnwhHik)\u000a[Conqueror](http://youtu.be/rdnuIiWMnQQ)

aVNo problem at all. I'm such a fanboy for these guys I just want people to listen to them, I really hope they get some more recognition for their work. It's fucking crazy they did all of this on their own, I hope they get a label (if they even want that) deal so they can do this full time. \u000a\u000aI'm at work so I can't link to their Facebook or YT pages but [here is their bandcamp page](http://mechinamusic.bandcamp.com/) and [here is their merch site.](http://www.mechinamusic.com/) Check out "Joe Tiberi" on YT, Facebook, and Soundcloud if you get a chance, there are a few more songs floating around worth listening to.

p2029
(lp2030
VBe'Lakor, Omnium Gatherum, Before the Dawn, Dark Tranquillity, Dawn of Solace, Swallow the Sun, Words of Farewell, maybe Ghost Brigade?\u000a\u000aThose are all some pretty mellow melodeath bands. Some of my favorites. Go to Insomnium's Encyclopedia Metallum page and look under the "Similar Artists" tab for more suggestions.
p2031
aVAlready knew Ghost Brigade and Be'Lakor. I don't really know why but i don't really enjoy Omnium Gatherum but yeah thanks for the other bands
p2032
aVJust to further reinforce, Words of Farewell is an amazing band.  I recommend "Vagrant Story" and "Ever After" in particular, but both albums from them are just great from start to finish.
p2033
aVCurious - When you say you don't really enjoy Omnium Gatherum - which of their albums did you check out? Because I can see not enjoying some of them, but I find it bizarre that one who likes Insomnium can't enjoy their later 2 albums, considering the Vanhala influence. If you liked Ephemeral, Out To The Sea and Revelations, (all from the latest Insomnium), then New World Shadows/Beyond (the albums) should at the least be interesting.
p2034
aVI listened to 'Beyond' (the album) but i don't even know why i didn't enjoyed.. it's just it wasn't what i was really looking for
p2035
aVI see.\u000a\u000aTry the New World Shadows album and see if that does anything. And if not, well, you just don't like them, which is fine ;P I was asking because maybe you had started with their earlier stuff, which is very far from their newer stuff.
p2036
aVI will later, listening to the other stuff that people posted atm
p2037
aVMaybe it's the vocals that you dislike? Although I absolutely love their melodies (seriously, they've got some of the best I've ever heard) I can't really stand the vocals, I too don't even know why I dislike them ... I like Amon amarth, insomnium, DT, in flames etc. but for some reason I just can't bring myself to like OG's singer.
p2038
aVI just don't know.. but i like those other bands that you named so i guess it might be that
p2039
aV[deleted]
p2040
aVSwallow the sun is more death/doom than melodeath in case that matters to you.
p2041
aVGood luck, I have never heard a more beautiful song than Lay of the Autumn by Insomnium. Un. Matched.\u000a\u000a\u000aInsomnium are the kings of MDM right now and it is for good reason.
p2042
aVTo me, Countless Skies by Be'lakor and Pure by Mors Principium Est are some of the finest examples of Melodic Death Metal I've ever come across. If you haven't heard of either song, I highly recommend you do!
p2043
aVMeh thanks, began to search a lot of time ago.. found some cool stuff but nothing really close to Insomnium, they are so awesome
p2044
aVI think bands like Dark Tranquillity and Amon Amarth are more entitled to the term "kings of MDM". They are amongst the ones that shaped the genre and Insomnium got it's sound from.\u000a\u000aDon't get met wrong, I wouldn't go as far as calling Insomnium a bad band, I have listened to them for extended periods and I don't know why I don't *really* like them, but if I had to put it in to an analogy I would say their music is like a canal: It starts somewhere, it goes somewhere. At some places it gets wider, at some less wide. At some places it flows quicker than at others, there might drive a boat through there. It's a perfectly fine waterway, but it remains a canal, purposely built with safe straight walls, and lacks the adventure and searching spirit of a river.\u000a\u000aedit: People who like Insomnium might also want to look in to [doom-death](http://www.reddit.com/r/doommetal) and [post metal](http://www.reddit.com/r/postmetal). They tend to have a similar atmosphere. Also early Katatonia (Brave Murder Days)
p2045
aVDon't get me wrong, i don't mean that those 2 bands sucks. Actually not at all, they were both okay and i'll certainly listen to them sometimes but it's just that it's not what i'm looking for. I'm not saying that i'm an 'extreme mdm' fan, i actually enjoy most of the mdm bands but infact i'm not searching for melodic metal bands, i'm searching for something close to Insomnium and you guys might think that Omnium Gatherum is close to it and yea, i'm not saying that you are wrong, but it's not to me. I didn't enjoyed them as i enjoy Insomnium and that's pretty much what i'm searching for, something to like in the way that i like Insomnium. Anyways sorry for my bad english.
p2046
aVMost certainly everyone is entitled to find any band their most favorite, by all means be my guest :). My issue, if you want to call it that, is more with people who put any band on a pedestal and anything anyone else says is in their eyes invalid criticism. Music taste is a very personal thing.\u000a\u000aAnyway, If you like the broody aspect of Insomnium, the genres I pointed to in my edit have a lot of this as well. In that case /r/atmosphericmetal might also be to your liking.
p2047
aVOh, didn't really mean to look like that.. my apologies if i did, but as I've already wrote before it's just i'm look for a certain kind of bands, even if other ones are good that isn't what i'm searching at the moment but be sure that i'll listen to them in the future! Anyways thanks a lot, i'll give a look there too.
p2048
aVNo worries, I was afraid of the same really.\u000a\u000aJust saw I had [this album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc7jnAJaMc) from Wolfheart which may be to your liking. Comes pretty close in my opinion.
p2049
aVSomebody already said Wolfheart but didn't really knew which songs should i try. That album sounds so nice i really like it, thanks.
p2050
aVI agree with you. Dark Tranquillity is my #1 band of all time and beats out Insomnium. However, I stated 'right now' as in they are going full force while bands like Amon Amarth and DT have wound down like a lot of bands have due to their status and longevity. DT has been at it for 20+ years and are still going strong. But if I had to put a band out there that is currently 'it', it would be Insomnium.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd it's okay, this whole music bit is all subjective. I don't even care for Omnium Gatherum and this sub eats their ass. Everyone has their own opinion.
p2051
aVI'd go for Persefone (Spiritual Migration is probably my favourite album of last year) and Omnium Gatherum.
p2052
aVListening to the album atm, some songs are awesome even if it isn't really what i was searching for
p2053
aVOmnium Gatherum is probably as close as you're gonna get. You can hear Omnium influences on Insomnium's new album.
p2054
aVHow about In Mourning (they are Swedish, for what it's worth)?  Try their most recent album The Weight of Oceans
p2055
aVMaybe [Noumena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYSzIFPlShY) is something you like? And check out [Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykt8_19GtJ4) and [Words of Farewell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy473boOcgE) as others have mentioned
p2056
aVThanks a lot for the links, didn't really knew which songs to listen with the other bands.\u000a**edit**: that first song is awesome
p2057
aVAnd now I know about Words of Farewell, thanks!
p2058
aVEquivalence is exactly like insomnium. Even named after the song of the same name from insomnium.
p2059
aVThanks a lot man, imo this one is the closest, listened some stuff they all sound nice
p2060

p2067
aVWintersun!
p2068
aVI'd recommend Eluveite. They aren't that close to Insomnium to be honest, but stick with me. Insomnium are by far my favourite metal band, and I've really struggled finding anything similar (besides the usual DT, at the gates). \u000a\u000aSo why have I recommended them? They have some super melodic songs, if you feel you could like something melodic but more folk orientated give them a try. If you don't like them then at least you know!\u000a\u000aRegardless, good luck with your search. http://youtu.be/lMY-Q2T0OIY

aVHey thanks a lot for this one. I also love folk metal so this one was amazing to me
p2070
aVGlad to hear it! the whole Slania album is great. In my mind it runs like a concept album. \u000a\u000aThis is one of the main reasons I love metal. So many different su genres to explore.

aVDark tranquility is pretty similar to Insomnium and they're from Sweden. You should try them if you haven't already.

p2073
aV[Snatched Cord](http://youtu.be/qV5esfWdUJE) has a very similar style. Other than that, I suggest asking this in /r/Metal101; those guys can probably help you out a lot.

aVI know of all those bands and I'm sure I've checked them out at one point or another, but for whatever reason they just didn't strike a chord with me. I'd have to check them out again to tell what I did/didn't particularly like about them. Coming from a progressive metal mindset, I would definitely stress that what I really enjoy is some technicality behind the guitars. \u000a\u000aIf I'm not mistaken, all those bands have been around for a long time, right? If there are particular albums that you think would fit what I'm looking for, I'll check them out again. I know that a lot of these bands that stick around for a long time end up changing their style a bit. \u000a\u000aFunny that you mention Kalter because that's another band that I think is fantastic, at least their last album Ubuntu (still need to check out Spiritual Angel). I think Ubuntu was cross-posted on r/progmetal which is how I found out about them. I was pretty bummed to hear they broke up recently. \u000a\u000aIf it helps, a couple other examples of bands I've really gotten into recently are Allegaeon and Persefone.

p2093
aVGive [Tengger Cavalry](http://tenggercavalry.bandcamp.com/) a try. Mongolian folk / death, weak on the guitar solo front but otherwise ticks all your boxes.
p2094
aVMaybe not so heavy on the Asian element in the first album, but more so in the second. But not in the same way as Whispered. But I LOVE whispered and they are really high up on my favorite bands list. You should definitely check out Wintersun and Kalisia. Both just inhuman musical ability of albums. Kalisia isn't asian sounding metal, but they cross several genre sounds in their album and I felt it was worth a mention anyway.
p2095
aVI'm a fan of Wintersun, moreso Time I than self-titled so I'm really looking forward to Time II. I actually bought Kalisia on a whim years ago but don't think I ever gave it the chance it deserved. I'll have to revisit that one.
p2096
aVA quick list of impressions for several of your recommendations: \u000a\u000aChildren of Bodom - Follow the Reaper: pretty good stuff. Of all the bands recommended here that I've checked out so far (still more to go!) this is probably the closest to what I'm looking for. I also listened to Halo of Blood. Not exactly crazy about the vocals but the music makes up for it.\u000a\u000aNevermore, Protest the Hero - already listen to these guys. Love 'em.\u000a\u000aObscura - most tech-death bands don't do it for me, but I actually like Omnivium a lot. I think it's the only tech-death album I own.\u000a\u000aShangren - not bad but doesn't quite grab me. The production is pretty poor and that can turn me off. I really prefer when the mixing/mastering is really "clean." \u000a\u000aRevocation - gave these guys a serious shot a couple months ago but they didn't stick. Fantastic solos but everything beyond the solos doesn't grab me. \u000a\u000aIn Flames - only album I had really listened to by them was A Sense of Purpose, which I've come to find out is one of their weaker efforts. Listened through Colony in it's entirety and it's much better.\u000a\u000aTengger Cavalry - these guys are interesting. Again, the production takes it down a notch for me, and I'm not a fan of the vocals. I do like the strings/oriental guitar aspects of it though.\u000a\u000aScar Symmetry - Holographic Universe is in my top 5 albums. Christian-era Scar Symmetry is pretty much the ideal band for my tastes. They, along with Opeth, were a huge step in getting me to appreciate some growlies in my music. \u000a\u000aSolution .45 - not quite as good as Christian-era SS, but a decent substitute. Looking forward to their next album.\u000a\u000aKnight Who Says Nee - I'll have to get to your recommendations in a follow-up post...\u000a\u000aSo is it just a coincidence or fluke that Thousand Eyes (Japanese band) and Whispered (Japanese style) have what I'm looking for? I notice that there haven't been any other Japanese band recommendations.
p2097

Additionally, the latter is from an album called "Raskasta Joulua," Swedish for: "Heavy Christmas."  Definitely worth checking out.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Finnish, not Swedish.

aVRaskasta Joulua is actually finnish for Heavy Christmas. Elize Ryd is swedish but the rest of the Raskasta Joulua crew are finnish.

aVFinland all the way, but an honourable mention to Australia for the single data point that is Be'lakor!
p2170
aVDon't forget Ne Obliviscarus. They aren't necessarily melo death but they are definitely worth a data point.
p2171
aVI will listen to anything that comes out of Scandinavia, especially Sweden.
p2172
aVAustralia currently. Be'lakor, Ne Obliviscaris and Orpheus are solid bands.
p2173
aVI'm all about the classic Gothenburg sound: In Flames, At the Gates, Dark Tranquility.
p2174
aVSwedish and Finnish are my two favorites
p2175
aVSweden for Amon Amarth, Katatonia and Dark Tranquility
p2176
aVLooking through the bands on my Ipod, I've found that I really like the Finnish Melodeath bands like Insomnium, Omnium Gatherum, Noumena, Wolfheart, Before The Dawn, and Swallow the Sun. Australia deserves a mention as well because of Valtari, Orpheus Omega, and the almighty Be'lakor.
p2177
aVSweden and Finland are my favourites, but I prefer Swedish melodeath- In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates, Amon Amarth and Scar Symmetry
p2178
aVSweden is neat because of In Flames, Arch Enemy, and Amaranthe. They're my favorite melodeath bands.\u000a\u000aSonic Syndicate, while not my favorite, raises my rating too.
p2179
aVI once took a spring break trip to Finland for the sole purpose of seeing Omnium Gatherum in concert, so I'm going to go with Finland.

aVTo be honest when that album came out it doubted they could pull it off live, after seeing them in 2006 at Wacken and being hugely disappointed. I saw them live at Summer Breeze in 2013 and they killed it. Really looking forward to whatever they're up to next.

aVSoilwork has always been my go to for Gothenburg metal. Their discography is vast enough to cover what you're looking for I'm sure. 
p2221
aVNot a recent band, but if you're looking for that kind of sound, you should definitely listen to Sacrilege (the band that Daniel Dinsdale played in before In Flames). \u000a\u000aOff the top of my head, I'd also recommend 'A bloodred path' by Gates of Ishtar, and 'Source' and 'The dying wonders of the world' by The Duskfall. I'm probably forgetting a lot, but my CDs are all packed away because new house and no shelves yet, so I can't look through them.
p2222
aVWhile more folky, Eluveitie has some Gothenburg style influences. 
p2223
aVIt's literally Dark Tranquillity with folky overtones. I'll point you to "Bloodstained Ground" for the best example.

aVTo be fair though, this is a pretty small community. I'm reasonably happy with the steady trickle of material that flows through here. I've added several bands to my library since subscribing. 
p2239
aVA "Hall of Fame". I like bands like In Flames, Dark Tranquility, At the Gates, Soilwork, Insomnium, Children of Bodom, Kalmah, Scar Symmetry, Sonic Syndicate etc. as much as the next person, but unless it's a new song or news related to mainstream bands that are usually the gateway into melodic death metal, i really don't want to see At The Gates - Blinded by Fear or In Flames - Jester Race (full album stream) and other popular songs from the prime era of various bands to be posted and upvoted repeatedly by the community.  
p2240

p2241
aV[deleted]
p2242
aVI think overall, we need more discussion.  The melodic death metal community on youtube is great, and discussion will bring out more activity.  Maybe a weekly or monthly discussion post or posts where people talk about big releases.  /r/folkmetal has several discussion posts that got me really into that sub, despite it having a tiny population.
p2243
aV###FLAIRS\u000a\u000aWhat kind of flairs? For a start 'we' can implement instruments, later on we can try to implement band's logos. This will be tricky i suppose since it needs to be cropped but still needs to be visible to the eye and know which goddamn logo it is. And implementing every goddamn MDM band is simply impossible. So if any1 has the skills and most important the time to make them it would be great.\u000a\u000afurther more adding a flair, and filling it in by urself is something that's much easier to do and kinda brings the same effect

p2256
aVI'm glad you enjoyed it. I've loved everything they've done - even the albums after Christian left. But this just fell flat for me. Bad lyric writing, terrible clean vocals on most songs (there are a couple exceptions), and mostly forgettable besides their single. The best part was Per's guitar work....which I expected to be great.\u000a\u000aI liked the last two songs on the album the best. So I didn't hate the album, I guess. Just disappointed.

p2282
aVSame here. I'm a huge fan of In Flames but this track, I'm not sure if I like it or not 
p2283
aVThe flow feels really broken and like they just meshed random instrument portions together. I can forgive the voice not sounding like the classic in flames due to Anders fucking up his throat. But the lyrics themselves are disappointing.
p2284
aV&gt; Anders fucking up his throat\u000a\u000awhen did this happen?
p2285
aVI actually really like newer In Flames, but this song just seems pretty terrible. First single I don't like from them, that's a bad sign...
p2286
aVI hear some SOAPF, but its so..... radio metal.
p2287
aVinstruments sound good. Vocals still are whiny and not In Flames...
p2288
aVOther than it being the main singer for In Flames.
p2289
aVBody snatchers struck after Clayman 
p2290
aVI could really grow to like this. That opening riff/solo is great. Getting very keen for this album
p2291
aVTypical mixed feelings reaction. I like it, but I miss the old stuff.
p2292
aVDoes any one else feel like this could have been on SOAPF? My only complaint would be if the album doesn't sound different from the others. Imo each album has been different from the rest in some regard. I like the intro of this song but after the lie awake part is were it sounds familiar.
p2293
aVI have the exact same opinion, this could totally be a bonus track for SOAPF. Even though I don't really liked the song, my real fear is that In Flames is used to release albums that, as you say, differ from previous ones but are very consistent. SOAPF was not that great but listening to it a few times was enough to get into it, not comparing it to their previous efforts. If they now start to try and please everybody with an album with a few soft, a few heavy, a few old school songs and so on, unless they truly hit the nail (pun intended), they are at risk of a weak album.
p2294
aVHear hear. Although, folks with the taste of death metal have not liked the band since clayman, each album was able to tell a new story and differ musically. I have never thought that they had a weak album. Hopefully, I feel the same way in September. So far there is a case why this is weaker than SOAPF. I believe its first single was Deliver Us, which musically was different than most IF. Rusted Nail however starts strong but ends stale...
p2295
aVStill with Anders' voice from early 2000's was still availible...\u000a\u000aThat's the main thing I get with In Flames since SoaPF. I just keep imagining bits as if Anders was still on top of his game, and just feel disappointed.
p2296
aVYou mean the 90s, right? Lol. I think his voice was better in when they were more melodeath than now. 
p2297
aVWell, depends. Even if it was just the growls he could pull off in the 2000's (so... post Clayman) would fit the sound better then the 90's stuff (up to and including Colony). Really, anything but whatever he's been trying to pull off...
p2298
aVI like everything from Jester Race to SoaPF (reroute being my least fave) but this is the first time I've been truly disappointed. I just hope that the album is better than this. The sound is ok, definitely has some trademark sound to it, but it doesn't seem to have a cohesive idea, it's all over the map. 
p2299
aVI have yet to find an In Flames album I hate.. This might be the one.\u000a\u000aAt least, judging from this song.
p2300
aVThey are definitely pulling influence from a range of things and mixing it in to a weird dish.\u000a\u000aI do have mixed feelings about this song because I feel like it doesnt really flow as nicely as others have. But I also felt that way about Behemoths new album and after having it on repeat i started to get really in to it and feel everything about it.\u000a\u000aHopefully that happens with this new album.\u000a\u000aEdit: Also this link seems to have a pretty bad rip of the song which i feel is hindering it a bit.
p2301
aVI can't say I'm a fan of their later stuff either, wouldn't really call it melodic death metal tbh (hell, even metal archives calls it melodic groove metal xD).  I really hope they play their older stuff when I see them in October...
p2302
aVLive they very very rarely play pre-clayman and if they do it's usually a single song.\u000a\u000aSo you'll probably get disappointed if you're expecting old stuff. Last time I saw them they played artifacts of the black rain which was great but apart from only for the weak they play nothing pre 2000's from the 3 times I've seen them before that.
p2303
aVsadface. I'll still go but I won't be able to mosh to groove metal :/
p2304
aVThey're still one of the best bands I've ever seen live though so you don't have to worry much, they've really got the live thing down. Lots of energy in those concerts.
p2305
aVI hope this is some kind of joke. This is honestly just bullshit put into an audio track. I didn't hate sounds of a playground fading like most people who love the old school in flames, but it had some substance. This song seems to have been wrote by a 10 year old.

aVMine was The Jester Race by In Flames. Specifically that song was the first I listened to, and then I moved onto December Flower and then Colony. Basically just grew from there. They were recommended to me by a buddy that I played Bad Commpany 2 with, and then I went all in.
p2315
aVI was never into the crap that played on our local radio stations growing up, and by Highschool I thought I just didn't like most music in general.  Then a friend played some Spineshank for me, which was a little better... I used Napster or Kazaa to download an album of theirs, song-by-song.  I went through the stuff I downloaded, and in classic crappy p2p filesharing manner of the day, one song was definitely not like the rest - it was the track "Transparent".  I did some searching and found out it was actually "Transparent" by In Flames.  It hooked me, and I grabbed all of In Flames stuff shortly thereafter.
p2316
aVArch enemy. Don't remember the particular song but was playing Halo 3 campaign with a buddy in the barracks with pandora on and one of their songs came on. Instantly downloaded everything from them and continued to explore the genre.
p2317
aVLike most of you, it was Soilwork/In Flames that started my foray into MDM. \u000a\u000aSpecifically my first Soilwork song was "Nerve", played during a local radio segment late at night. I driving home from my first job at 17, and I couldn't believe how good it sounded. In Flames is harder to pinpoint a single song, but there were some PvP videos from the game World of Warcraft back in it's glory "vanilla" days. Some of the first videos I remember watching shortly after starting to play had In Flames songs mixed in. I would say it was either Cloud Connected or Trigger.
p2318
aVKalmah's Black Roija. I can't say what about it pulled me over it just... did. Masterpiece.
p2319
aVDisarmonia mundi-common state of inner violence.
p2320
aVDistance by soilwork. Led me to getting their discography and it snowballed from there. I still listen to them daily
p2321
aVDark Tranquillity - At Loss for Words I think.  
p2322
aVI heard Zombie Inc. by In Flames in the early 00's (around the time Reroute to Remain was released) and the rest is history.  Probably my favorite IF song to this day.
p2323
aVI'm probably going to get shit on here BUUUUT.....\u000a When i first started listening to metal, it was the typical ''young kid exploring heavy music'' bands. You know slipknot and stuff. Eventually i started listening actual metal, and i heard about the black dahlia murder. Completely changed me. I went backwards and started listening to gothenburg stuff, older melodic stuff, older metal bands all together. I really got into black metal because of this as well.
p2324
aVI can't pick a particular song, but In Flames' Colony album got me hooked on MDM. Not only that, it was the gateway into all extreme metal with harsh vocals. 
p2325
aVI think the song that got me into MDM was In Flames - Cloud Connected. I saw the video on tv once and thought it was pretty cool so I went and downloaded as many songs by them as I could. 
p2326
aVSoilwork's overload was my first taste on one of those tv music channels. Then I bought the cd at sun coast and never looked back. 
p2327
aVGot into metal around 2004 with Metallica, Korn, that sort of crap; heard Take This Life and some others from Come Clarity back in 2006 and consequently went backwards in their discography. \u000a\u000aSettled on TJR-Whoracle-Colony-Clayman as the foundation of a new love and my absolute favourite albums ever since.
p2328
aVFirst MDM song I ever listened to was Cloud Connected by In Flames after I first got an mp3 player way back when I was still in grade school. I had no way of acquiring music so I gave my mp3 player to a buddy of mine and he put all of his music on it and In Flames was one band that he listened too and put on there for me. I didn't really start to get into MDM until a few months ago when I was on the hunt for new music to listen too. Someone on here reccomended metalarchives.com to search for new music. I went on there typed in In Flames, went to their similar artists section and would just click through artists. This sub has also helped me discover a bunch of awesome bands too. I would also listen to Spotify to which helped immensely.  So pretty much through my buddy, Spotify and Reddit.
p2329
aVgot into MDM through WoW weirdly enough.\u000a\u000aMore specifically [Vurtne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_cLN66zHA#t=300)\u000a\u000aBefore that I only really listened to power metal and symphonic metal so that was my first experience in scream/growls when it comes to metal. Come clarity was released the same year as that video and that's where I started. Then went into other swedish bands like soilwork, at the gates, arch enemy, hypocrisy and more.\u000a\u000a
p2330
aVIn Flames, The Quiet Place and Dial 595-escape. I had never heard any kind of music like it and it made me feel things that only a handful of songs have made me feel since.
p2331
aVThe song that got me into Melodeath is ["Hypnotic" by Still it Cries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jemu_DDhpLQ). I found it when I was searching youtube for some good metalcore bands. Before then I couldnt't stand the vocals in Melodeath.
p2332
aVIn flames - Take this life\u000a\u000aI first heard this song on guitar hero 3...changed my life
p2333
aV[In Flames- Dreamscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twTk2Cjrv8Q)
p2334
aVI'm not even sure.  I was bumming around looking for something new a few months ago.  Thanks to my exposure to Gojira, I found a gateway into death metal vocals.\u000a\u000aSomehow I re-discovered the existence of Amon Amarth, and that led into Insomnium and In Flames.  I don't actually like the sound of Amon Amarth too much, but I'm really enjoying Dark Tranquility, Omnium Gatherum, Be'lakor, and Insomnium.
p2335
aVAdd Words of Farewell to those last 4 and you have my top 5 bands atm. Might be worth checking out.
p2336
aVI looked them up today.  I've heard "Telltale Notion" before; I don't remember how I stumbled across it.  Very nice.
p2337
aVPersefone's Mind As Universe (track). I've always been more of a straight death person than melodeath (and still am, by far) and had only liked scattered melodeath tracks before hearing them, but their sound convinced me to look more into melodeath and listen to it a bit more. Persefone is still by far my favorite melodeath band, but I have been listening to a lot more of it since I first heard them. 
p2338
aVI would have to say Bullet Hole by The Haunted. I was already into heavy metal as a kid, but it was more Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, etc... I was playing hockey with some friends one day probably when I was around 11 or 12 (I'm 26 now) and we always had a boombox with us. That song came up on one friend's mix and I was hooked. Not too long after another friend burned me a copy of Burning Bridges by Arch Enemy. From there I just started checking out more bands from Sweden and then eventually Finland. 
p2339
aVI was introduced to MDM by Arch Enemy. I saw the music video for Revolution Begins and was immediately hooked.
p2340
aVFor a time back when I think I was in high school, my parents upgraded to Digital Cable. It came with various music channels, and I'd listen to the metal one. I kept a pen and an old junk mail envelope nearby so I could write down stuff I liked and find it later. The first MDM song I found on this channel was In Flames - A Touch of Red. Eventually I was trying to find more things similar to In Flames, though I'd never heard of the "MDM" term. Everything was just "metal". Found Dark Tranquility, then started tracking down other artists I heard on that channel like Susperia and Darkane.
p2341
aVIn Flames and Soilwork pulled me in -- they were the first two "screaming" bands I listened to.\u000a\u000aWhile I now prefer their earlier stuff, I still have a fondness for both bands' mid-career stuff, as they were the records that pulled me into metlodeath.\u000a\u000aOh, also Insomnium. The first time I heard Above the Weeping World I was blown away.
p2342
aVDark Tranquillity - Lethe. Best way to get in this sh*t. One of my friends sent me this song long ago, about 3-4 years, and I'm still listening it.\u000aAnd one another is Edge Of Sanity - Twilight. Man those riffs are driving me crazy.

p2352
(lp2353
VYou're going to be in for a huge grin once you get to Above a Weeping World and Shadows of a Dying Sun.
p2354
aVEvery single album has blown my mind in some way if not multiple ways.
p2355
aVEveryone of them is worth checking out, and while some have lost their shine after a dozen listens (to me that's In The Halls of Awaiting and One for Sorrow) for me, those two I don't think I'll ever bore of. So consistent and amazing - Mortal Share I've listened to thousands of times and still love it just as much as the first few listens. There isn't a single bad track on AaWW, and the same goes for Shadows, although I'm not a huge fan of the last 2 tracks, but the rest of the album (for the most part - including the bonus track) is just so spectacular.
p2356
aVThe mixing for one for sorrow was all over the place. ATWW is hands down one of their best work. \u000a\u000aMy all time fav song by insomnium is *song of the forlorn son*, the fucking outro is out of this world!
p2357
aVThat song is part of the Exhibit A to why I call Insomnium "The Kings of the Outro".\u000a\u000aRidiculous.
p2358
aVI knew why something seemed off, it's Above THE Weeping World.  I kept looking at your guys' comments and was confused.  Just FYI.  :)
p2359
aVWell shit. 
p2360
aVI have listened Above a Weeping World a few times, and I definitely enjoy The Killjoy from it. It just sounds so... *victorious* would best describe it for me. \u000a\u000aI don't quite know the rest of the tracks by name yet but I did listen to the album a handful of times without skipping tracks. It's definitely a keeper.
p2361
aVYou're going to be stoked when you hear Be'lakor.
p2362
aVHell yeah, Insomnium and Be'lakor are my 2 favourites. I actually might slightly prefer the latter, so good! 
p2363
aVI wanted to tell him that too. :)
p2364
aVHaha I love them as well. I kind of discovered them together with Fractal Gates.
p2365
aVTheir newest album, Shadows of the Dying Sun is goddamned phenomenal.
p2366
aVThe best parts are the parts that aren't metal to me. the acoustic part at the end of While We Sleep is damn beautiful
p2367
aVThe guitar solos just make me stop what I'm doing and air guitar along, *every single time*.
p2368
aVVanhala's a fitting name for the guy, isn't it?
p2369
aVNot a single unlikeable song in that one. And I hadn't listened to Insomnium at all before that album.\u000a\u000aThere's something very appealing in the whole dreamy but bleak theme the album has. The songs are like lullabies. Lullabies for a dying sun. It's quite lovely.
p2370
aVI'll listen to that one next! Will probably be somewhere this afternoon.
p2371
aV[Fuck yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/stUcAqd.jpg)
p2372
aVI bought their necklace from the webshop and got a flag, poster, signed postcard and lanyard for free. Best damn day of my life.
p2373
aVYou'll probably like Omnium Gatherum and Be'lakor
p2374
aVCool story bro. Really. I was slowly drawn in through Rap Rock and Nu Metal lol. Also was a guitar player at the time. Korn, the Deftones, Static-X, and the like slowly turned into Industrial music like Fear Factory and then into Metal Core like As I Lay Dying and Trivium and then I found Soilwork, Disarmonia Mundi, In Flames, Dark Tranquility, Mnemic, Insomnium and Omnium Gatherum all on a compilation album (The best of melodic death metal volume 5) and the rest is history. That musical journey probably took me like 5 years or so to complete. I remember being a Deftones fanatic in High School and the one who showed me that compilation album was a college buddy.\u000a\u000aGuitar and drum work is what really drew me in, constantly searching for that tingly feeling down my spine that only the best music could produce.\u000a\u000aInsomnium is my favorite band now. Omnium Gatherum a very close second. I love it all though.\u000a\u000aIf you have any questions let us know.
p2375
aV&gt; Guitar and drum work is what really drew me in.\u000a\u000aRight on. Insomnium has some incredible riffs in a style I haven't heard before. The rhythmic way they play guitar and the amount of pull-offs back to the open string (Like the intro of Through The Shadows or The New Beginning) they do is something I hadn't heard before. \u000a\u000aWill definitely check out Omnium Gatherum if they're a close second to Insomnium!
p2376
aVFor OG I'd recommend to start with The Redshift (kind of an intro to their new style) then New World Shadows (it's my 2nd best album of all time behind Insomnium's "Above a Weeping World") and Beyond. Thing to know is that Insomnium swapped guitarists for their 6th album (Shadows of a Dying Sun) and ended up getting the lead from Omnium Gatherum - which once you listen to that list you'll notice is amazing.\u000a\u000aSo yeah, they're pretty close, but the albums from OG earlier then Redshift are fairly different. Not that you shouldn't check them out, but I'd look at them after looking at the masterpieces (NWS and Beyond).
p2377
aVOne of my favorites of Omnium Gatherum is Formidable:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z6qBwJ7w6I\u000a\u000aAlso like their Nightwalkers:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F0_4iqs720\u000a\u000aYou might also like Eternal Tears of Sorrow:\u000a\u000aLost Rune of Thunder - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNK22CjpEOc\u000a\u000aTears of Autumn Rain - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtMUp3FLcxY\u000a\u000aGotta throw a few from Kalmah too:\u000a\u000aThe Black Waltz - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZxKquN-Mk\u000a\u000aEvil in You - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iagPxfzebv8\u000a\u000aDance of the Water - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynuJuTFNuqo\u000a\u000aHope some of them hit home :)
p2378
aVThey now share a guitarist actually. IIRC the one from Insomnium was also a Neural Surgeon and that was way more important.
p2379
aVInsomnium were my ticket in to the MeloDeath genre to. I freaking love then.
p2380
aVIf you like insomnium then you will like most music on this sub.
p2381
aVAfter all the Omnium Gatherum/Be'lakor/etc. recommendations, I feel obliged to also mention Noumena.  \u000aHaven't listened to their latest album yet, but the others are great.
p2382
aVWelcome aboard.  Melodic Death is the easiest of the harsher sub genres to get into.  It's what I was most into back in 2003 when I first started to listen to metal and it's pretty much the same now too.  Most likely you will venture into more heavier genres.  If you like Insomnium, you should check out their old side project Watch Me Fall.
p2383
aV&gt;  If you like Insomnium, you should check out their old side project Watch Me Fall.\u000a\u000aWill do.\u000a\u000aI've listened to "regular" metal (I feel dirty for calling it that) for years now, but haven't explored much of the subs yet. Until now it was usually Alter Bridge, Tremonti, Avenged Sevenfold, Amorphis, Disturbed, Kamelot, SoaD, Slipknot, Escape the Fate, and Van Canto.  \u000aWill definitely keep expanding my list. 
p2384
aVYeah, Amorphis are pretty awesome.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kQBTwygtKQ This is the lead track on the Watch Me Fall album, it's awesome.
p2385
aVWow! I just listened to that entire album twice. Fuckin amazing! Thanks!
p2386
aVOld side project? Why was I never told of this!?!\u000a\u000aI have to listen to it fight away!
p2387
aVYeah dude.  One album and done.  Same vocalist/bassist from Insomnium.  ENJOY.  These are the benefits of being into bands way back when.  You get your hands on the good shit that goes away and never spoke of again.  But then you have nice guys like me who like to share.  :D

aVI actually got into Insomnium and other MeloDeath bands (Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, At The Gates, Soilwork, Kamelot, etc.) from listening to Viking/Folk metal (Amon Amarth, Ensiferum). Pandora gave me a song by Insomnium called Black Waters and i've been hooked on MeloDeath ever since. 
p2391
aVI do know a couple of Ensiferum songs because I started learning them on guitar. I haven't gotten to listening full albums yet, though.\u000a\u000aSome songs I like/play are Burning Leaves, Old Man and Little Dreamer.
p2392
aVOooh take a listen to Sword Chant. Definitely a fun one for guitar due to tasty licks and interesting pacing. Token of Time, Battle song, and Windrider are my other favs. Old Man/Little Dreamer is good too. If it's not too much, check out Falconer if you don't know them already. Wings of Serenity or Mindtraveller are good ones to start on. \u000a\u000aI'll stop now. Rock on!

(In 2012 a roleplaying game with the same name but based on that single campanig was published.)

Let's just say I've had my reasons and leave it at that.\u000a\u000a&gt; We're currently knee-deep in the S.45 recordings, which unfortunately have been a bit delayed, as a whole, due to various reasons. However, I will start recording the vocals in 1-1,5 weeks time now, which is something I'm both dreading and looking forward to! Just waiting to receive the first 5-6 songs from Jani, who are currently busy tracking guitars, before I can get going for real.\u000a\u000a&gt; In the meantime I will post a teaser with/for a new project I've got going with a good friend of mine, later this week, so be sure to keep an eye and an ear out for that.\u000a\u000a&gt; More news as it happens!\u000a\u000aWhen asked about the release dates:\u000a\u000a&gt; Some time during the spring of 2015. We're aiming at mixing mid-January. Both albums are recorded, mixed and mastered simultaneously, but they will not be released at the same time. The second one will be released some time during the fall of 2015, if everything goes according to plan.

aVSod Swedish, this is *the best* MDM song, Unfortunately, I discovered the band about a week before they broke up, which made me rage pretty hard. But this song....this song has been on every CD, every MP3 player....I hear it at least three or four time a week. It's so goddamn good.

aVFunny you say that. The band wanted a "European" sound from their music (similar to CoB and Norther albums released at the time), so they roped in Finnish producer Anssi Kippo to produce and record the album with them. Hence they sound so similar on this album.
p2498
aVI remember reading about their old lead singer once and he had listed his inspirational bands. One of the bands was very out of the blue, very ambient, almost like if Enya was more acoustic. I listened to it and loved it but I haven't for the life of me been able to remember it. Drives me insane.

p2529
aVI find myself wondering how I was unaware of this band.....
p2530
aVThey seem to be lesser known than other melodeath bands for some reason. I only just discovered them two years ago, but holy shit was I glad I did.
p2531
aVYea I'm liking them a lot.  Gonna have to get some of their albums tonight.
p2532
aVLast 2 are similar in quality and all around great. Prior 4 are fairly different in sound, with "Redshift" being more of a transition album.\u000a\u000aIt's all great stuff, but NWS and Beyond are the two you're looking for the most.

asVAn excellent compilation album: "Brutal S**t: The Very Best Melodic Death Metal In The World"
p2534
(lp2535
VThere's no Insomnium in this playlist? maybe I'm biased, but I think they're hands down the best Melodeath band on the planet. 
p2536
aVThe whole point of these compilations is to discover bands you've never heard before, and your *only* comment is that a band you apparently know very well isn't there?  Let me guess, saw they weren't there, and didn't listen.
p2537
aVActually, no. I listen to ~~5~~ 11 of these bands regularly and have heard around half of the songs prior to this compilation. Of the bands I listen to, I think that their songs on this compilation are neither their best, nor their most representative song.\u000a\u000aI'm not trying to bash on this album - there are some very good songs and some very good bands, but personally I would like to add some things to the list. When lists like this are created, there seems to be an inherent problem of never being able to fully encapsulate every aspect of a subgenre.\u000a\u000aIf it's a Melodeath album, I don't necessarily agree with CoB being on there, as they're more of an Extreme Metal band, whereas Insomnium, who are THE definition of Melodeath, was snubbed. Dark Tranquility wasn't included. Not sure what their direction was on this list. \u000a\u000aKeep in mind, this is only my opinion. People are fully entitled to tell me I'm off the mark with my musical tastes, but then we arrive at the argument that music is subjective - that's all fine and dandy. But what isn't, is when people put words into my mouth. \u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: Was going off memory when I commented and i just now looked at the list again. Turns out I know a lot more of these bands well than I originally said. I've heard of most all of them, but I'm familiar with 11.
p2538
aVCoB is definitely melodeath. That's the consensus, anyway. I've heard them referred to as the "Kings of Melodeath." (although I don't agree with that title.)   \u000a   \u000aThere are definitely more bands that could be on the album, but already has quite a few songs on it.
p2539
aVHmm..they seem a bit too thrash-y to be MDM for me. Don't get me wrong, I've been playing CoB on spotify almost exclusively for the past week and a half - I love their music. I suppose my idea of melodic death metal is actually doom-infused, moody death metal, with growly vocals and emphasis on the guitar work and melodies. Kind of a happy medium between Wintersun's complex composition, Before the Dawn's melancholic, introspective mood, with Chrigel (Elveitie)'s vocals. \u000a\u000aMaybe it's time for my frame of reference to shift.\u000a\u000aBut hey, this subgenre is in need of diversity, and I'm really glad there are bands that are pushing the boundaries. On the contrary, Be'lakor is a great young band, but I'm a little worried that they'll fail to make a lasting innovation to the melodeath community.  \u000a\u000aAll around, this is a good compilation.
p2540
aVSo many people into our style of music are like this. Shittay1
p2541
aVCounter point - if someone has a vague interest in this genre and listens to this compilation without knowing the bands, they would be missing out on Insomnium.  Plus if it was to discover bands that you haven't heard of, why is Children of Bodom on there?  They are like 10x as popular as Insomnium.
p2542
aVAgreed that CoB is a little bit too big for a sampler like this(along with a couple other bands on it), but the tracklisting was probably decided by which bands the record company has rights to more than pushing the independent bands.  CoB might give just enough name recognition for someone to say hey if *they're* in this group, maybe I'll like the others.\u000a\u000aThat said, if I were to review the compilation, I wouldn't mention CoB and nobody else, let alone talk about bands that aren't on it.
p2543
aVDistortion Sleep, ahhh yes! 
p2544
aVSurprised, in a good way, to see Eluveite on this list. Think this will be my Monday morning listen. Cheers!
p2545
aVOut of all the Arsis songs, "We Are The Nightmare"? Very poor choice.
p2546
aVI'll be sure to pass this along to the compiler, who I obviously know personally... I'm sure they'll immediately revise the album to your liking :P
p2547
aVLOL. I'm just saying it's one of their least melodic songs. Something like "The Face of My Innocence" or "Wholly Night" would probably be a better representation of both the band and the genre.
p2548
aVYeah I do agree with that. "We Are The Nightmare" isn't very accessible-sounding to new listeners. I prefer the more melodic ones myself :)

p2567
aVI feel like we should stop viewing in flames as melo death now (obviously) and stop expecting a Melo death album. They clearly arent going near that genre anymore.\u000a\u000aThis song is more akin to deftones/crosses and tbh i enjoy it. If i was on a melo death binge though i would not listen to this.
p2568
aVMore 'mellow'-death than melodeath. I actually enjoy it too.\u000a\u000aEdit: It's just lacking a bit of kick or a hook or something. This song reminds me a lot of Liberation and A New Dawn from SOAPF but it just lacks the crescendo of Liberation and the full chorus of A New Dawn.
p2569
aVyeah pretty much.\u000a\u000aI still really like most of the stuff they've put out, but they are definitely becoming more of a rock band/hard rock band than metal now, but who knows, maybe there is a secret best melo death song on the album.\u000a\u000aWe can dream!
p2570
aVWell, SOAPF had some really heavy songs (the puzzle from memory was pretty nuts), so it's not like they *can't* make that music again. And it's not like they don't sound anything like they used to; they're still In Flames, and they've still got those melodeath elements. It's just not the same as their old stuff.

p2578
aVNo, they are in it for the money. That's the issue. They are reaching out to a much larger crowd with this bland radio rock bullshit than they ever did with melodeath. That's how these bands die.
p2579
aVSounds like a little STYE leaked in.
p2580
aVSounds more to me like they took SoaPF to the even more bland extreme.\u000a\u000aI think their last good album was A Sense of Purpose, even though they stopped being melodeath around 2002. Soundtrack was still a decent album, just not melodeath.\u000a\u000aThis is just bland and boring.

aVI didn't include Opeth in my list, though they are possibly my favorite band, because I think of them more as prog metal.

p2600
aVPersefone was "a lot earlier" in your melodeath career?  Now I feel old.  Early in my melodeath career was more than a decade ago.
p2601
aVWell, technically, mine was 3 years ago. Persefone should not fall under that umbrella, though. I was just spitting out albums I liked a lot before, then made it into a list of general "just couldn't find a spot list" (Persefone, Lunarsea). Didn't revise what I had written before that, then boom.\u000a\u000aWhat I guess I meant (for the rest other then the 2 mentioned above) were that my taste has changed a lot compared to last year in terms of melodeath, and those albums - which were once held in high regard - aren't really what tickles my fancy anymore.

aVNice list, glad to see Lunarsea on it. They are highly underrated.

aV2012, actually. February, 2012. Saw them perform the whole thing live on December 16th 2012, too.\u000a\u000aAnd since I started listening to melodeath around 2010, this would be fair :P It was more to say that I had my "CoB, Kalmah, Amon Amarth, Wintersun" phase. Then I forgot I had started out that list with that sentence and just added other albums I had particularly liked for a long period of time, but no longer did it as much for me (except for PErsefone and Lunarsea - if I had 2 more spots on the list they would be the two I put in there).

There are a few bands like Before the Dawn and Children of Bodom that might make my list on another day.  Even still, there are a few of my favorite bands, like Mercenary, Amorphis, and Sentenced, that have some melodeath history, but none of their true melodeath albums make my list.  Though I really hate the metal genre war, I can't really justify adding Skyforger or The Cold White Light to a melodeath list.\u000a\u000aI know there are a few very popular melodeath bands missing from my list (e.g. Insomnium, Amon Amarth, Wintersun, Norther, Omnium Gatherum, etc.).  For some reason, these bands haven't "hooked" me like some of their melodeath brethren.  Maybe I just need some more exposure.
p2609
aVsweet list. The band i haven't gotten into there is scar symmetry. Ill give them a shot again today, what album you recommend after looking at my list?  
p2610
aVProbably Pitch Black Progress, it's the most "traditional" melodeath of their albums.  Since your list is (nearly) void of clean vocals, I'll warn you that Scar Symmetry relies fairly heavily on clean choruses.  Fortunately, Christian's growl is pretty brutal, which keeps a heavier edge to the music.
p2611
aVI agree with what /u/MadStorkMSU said, "Pitch Black Progress" (the song) and "The Kaleidoscopic God" from the album are both good starts if you aren't into clean vocals as much. Also "The Illusionist" was the single from the album and does a pretty good job of pulling people into it from my experience. 
p2612
aVI just listened to skyforger (amorphis) for the first time and its excellent. Its weird i don't usually like whole power metal vocal style all that much but the guitar work, keyboards and grand piano melodies win me over. Thanks!

p2614
aVWho cares what people think, Hatebreeder, Hatecrew Death Roll and Surtur Rising are all very well melodic death metal albums.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Holy shit just checked out Chthonic for the first time, so goddamn heavy.  
p2615
aVFuck yes. I've been in to melodeath for so long now I've heard most bands that are at least moderately known so finding something like this is always a treat!
p2616
aVThis x 1000... So hard to find something refreshing in this genre. Put me down for also discovering Chthonic today. Damn, these guys are awesome!
p2617
aVReally kicked the game up a notch for me when I discovered them last year. They're great live as well, I saw them play on the 25th of December in front of maybe 20 people last year. They enjoyed the show, were thankful for the people that showed up and stayed around for a chat and pictures afterwards. Really nice folks, all of them.
p2618
aVI got to see them on Ozzfest of all places one year. They are pretty fantastic live.
p2619
aVLooks like we agree that roughly half the list should be Arch Enemy, In Flames, and Soilwork, though we seem to disagree on the albums.  I'm surprised to see The Living Infinite as the only Soilwork album.  Obviously, music is a matter of taste, but I feel that both A Predator's Portrait and Natural Born Chaos are superior albums to The Living Infinite.  I guess that could change the more I listen to TLI.
p2620
aVWall of text coming in, sorry.\u000a\u000aWell, I do like Predator's Portrait and Natural Born Chaos. But they don't go on my list. The main reason for this is that none of them surprised me as much as TLI.\u000a\u000aSo:\u000a\u000aLast year I was at a point where I thought that I've seen or rather heard it all melodeath-wise. I thought that nothing really new could arise from that since it had been a very long time since I discovered a band or found a new album that I really, really liked. I hadn't really listened to Soilwork for a long time, most of my melodeath routine consisted of In Flames and Arch Enemy, and I didn't expect much from Soilwork since, while they had a couple of good songs, I never ranked them that high in my favorite melodeath bands.\u000a\u000aThen TLI came out and I sort of found out about it by accident and gave it a listen - and kept listening to it for the next 3 months straight. I was just surprised at the overall quality and songwriting, especially since it has 20 freaking songs on it. Sure it's a fair bit more mainstream since most of the stuff but to be honest fuck that. It's fast, got great melodies and I think the overall sound and production are amazing. I also saw Soilwork for the second time live last year(first time being at Wacken 2006 where they SUCKED(honestly it was really bad...)) and they rocked, so that's why that album is on that list.
p2621
aVThat's certainly a fair assessment and I truly enjoy discussions like this.\u000a\u000aI am probably a bit biased, as Soilwork was my main gateway into melodeath.  Natural Born Chaos was the first melodeath album I purchased, and I was hooked.  Soon after NBC came Reroute to Remain (In Flames) and Figure Number Five (Soilwork).  These albums hold a special place in my musical heart.  Everything about them "surprised me" (to use your words).  I certainly liked The Living Infinite enough to put it in my top 20 list, but NBC and APP are both in my top 5.  I think that if, say, Dark Tranquillity or In Flames were my main gateway to melodeath, I might feel the same way you do about Soilwork's discography.
p2622
aVI'm with you in that Soilwork was the first band to really get me into melodeath and with Natural Born Chaos, too. Fantastic album. But TLI is absolutely Soilwork's best work yet. Still, I don't think they have an album I don't like.
p2623
aVYeah I guess that was also a bit part of the problem. For example I used to LOVE In Flames and Children of Bodom, but their recent albums have left me utterly disappointed, so I guess that contributed to the fact that I was very positively surprised.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, I totally get your point and I haven't in fact listened to the older Soilwork material properly(except for Predator's Portrait, which I own). So I think I'll do just that, maybe I'm in for a surprise or two there as well.
p2624
aVI never got into COB much, though I love Follow the Reaper.\u000a\u000aI have been a big In Flames fan for a while now.  I agree that the last few In Flames albums have been disappointing, though (in my opinion) Sounds of a Playground Fading was a marked improvement over A Sense of Purpose.\u000a\u000aAs far as Soilwork is concerned, The Living Infinite was a huge return to form after a decade of *relative* mediocrity.  The Panic Broadcast had some great moments, but never really put it all together.  Sworn to a Great Divide is easily the worst album in their catalog.  Stabbing the Drama is (was?) their best post-Natural Born Chaos album, as it was a great mix of melody and aggression.  It still had a few stinkers, though (e.g. Fate in Motion and If Possible), and relied heavily on the metalcore movement (which is a bit strange, as Soilwork is an obvious influence on many metalcore bands, not the other way around).  Figure Number Five felt like an experimental album.  There were a ton of keyboard atmospheres thrown in, which didn't quite work.  I still love the album, thoguh, and it has some of Soilwork's catchiest choruses (e.g. Distortion Sleep).  In all, Soilwork has has some amazingly strong songs in the years since Natural Born Chaos, but never really put it all together and released another amazing album until The Living Infinite.
p2625
aVSums it up beautifully. Regarding In Flames, I miss the heaviness of the old albums, especially in Anders' voice. While it probably was the best for him, Jesper Strömblad leaving did not really help the songwriting. I thought Björn could pull it off, but there's just been something missing ever since.
p2626
aVIt was off-putting to listen to the last album and keep thinking "Damn, imagine if this was Anders 5 to 10 years ago performing".\u000a\u000aI personally never got into Soilwork. Mr. Strid just doesn't do it for me. Only album that held my attention (for a short while) was "Chainheart Machine"
p2627
aVOk, here goes in no particular order:\u000a\u000aKalmah - Swampsong\u000a\u000aKalmah - The Black Waltz\u000a\u000aKalmah - For the Revolution\u000a\u000aAmon Amarth - The Crusher\u000a\u000aAmon Amarth - Versus the World\u000a\u000aDark Tranquillity - Projector\u000a\u000aDark Tranquillity - Character\u000a\u000aDark Tranquillity - We are the Void\u000a\u000aWintersun - Wintersun\u000a\u000aWintersun - Time 1 (and probably 2 when it is finally released)\u000a\u000aThe Absence - Riders of the Plague\u000a\u000aThe Absence - Enemy Unbound\u000a\u000aIn Flames - The Jester Race\u000a\u000aIn Flames - Whoracle\u000a\u000aChildren of Bodom - Hatebreeder\u000a\u000aBe'lakor - Stone's Reach\u000a\u000aSoilwork - The Living Infinite\u000a\u000aAmorphis - Skyforger\u000a\u000aDisarmonia Mundi - Mind Tricks\u000a\u000aEternal Tears of Sorrow - A Virgin and a Whore\u000a\u000aOne album that might be debatable as melodeath that I really love is Death's Symbolic. I think it is far enough away from traditional death metal because of its abundance of melodies in the guitar work. 
p2628
aVI would definitely put Death's "A Sound of Perseverance" in my top 10 albums in general, but doesn't fit in this thread. Symbolic is great too, but I prefer the progressive edge on "SoP".
p2629
aVYeah, that is definitely one of my favorite Death albums along with Symbolic and Leprosy.

VDamn. I feel that they peaked a long time ago, but I still woudn't want to see them break up. 
p2671
aVYeah I think Fury of Our Maker's Hand and Last Kind Words were their best material. I still like the newer albums, but it seems like it lost some of it's edge from the earlier ones. Either way, Dez seems like an awesome guy and has to be one of the hardest working guys in metal, so I hope it's true that they come back in '16.
p2672
aVPersonally I loved their first album the most. I Dreamed I died and Cry For Me Sky are two of my most played songs.
p2673
aVBoth great tunes. I love their grindier stuff like Grinfucked and Digging Up The Corpses.
p2674
aVI like Devildriver, but if any band could use a hiatus, it's them.  They've been on cruise control for a few albums now.  If a break can breathe some fresh air into them, great.  I wish more bands would take some time off instead of just cranking out the albums every 2 years and then touring for a year each time.  They get stale, fast.
p2675
aVFeels like a break could do them some good. The last 2 albums haven't really been up to par with their earlier works. But DevilDriver is one of the best live bands I've seen, incredible energy and stage presence; would hate to see them disappear.
p2676
aVAgreed. They have an amazing stage presence and incredible energy during live shows! It's one of the things that makes me love the band. \u000a\u000aA lot of times, Dez is referred to as 'the hardest working guy in metal', which may have caught up to him, the band and the music. With an album cycle every 1-1/2 to 2 years and seemingly on the road all the time, maybe this is a well deserved break to regroup.

aV[deleted]
p2760
aVSweet list you got there, but don't Insomnium use a lot of synth, actually?
p2761
aVNot really, they don't have a dedicated keyboard player. All melodic parts are done with guitars and bass. Maybe on the newer albums they do have synth parts in studio, but you listen to their debut and sophomore albums, they aren't using any synths, except in intros to some songs to create a sense of foreboding.
p2762
aVAh okay, well no dedicated keyboard player, yes but last time I saw them tgey did make use if a lot of recorded synth backing tracks. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 
p2763
aVAmon Amarth.

aVAmon Amarth is pretty much my go to response when someone asks for MeloDeath. \u000a\u000aUnless they want clean vocals, then they get Disarmonia Mundi.

aV[The Absence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS3QeWiKumk) is a band you might dig. They have a different style than In Flames and DT but I think they will be right up your alley.

aVHere are some albums you might like:\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Flames - Colony, Soundtrack to Your Escape, Come Clarity, The Jester Race\u000a\u000aDark Tranquillity - We are the Void, Character, The Gallery\u000a\u000aSoilwork - A Predator's Portrait\u000a\u000aAt the Gates - Slaughter of the Soul\u000a\u000a\u000a
p2825
aVI should have clarified, I've heard all the In Flames discography, and I forgot to also Mention I love the Gallery, but the Jester race and Come Clarity are like total opposites to me. Great albums, don't get me wrong, but I loved reroute to remain and cayman and want more like that. I'll definitely listen to at the gates and what I've heard from soilwork hasn't really stood out for me. But I'll check it out, thanks! 
p2826
aVHmm, no Soilwork, huh?  They are very close to Clayman and Reroute to Remain era In Flames, so maybe check out [Follow the Hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfBCYeUjIxU) or [Rejection Role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odVeW4FCBF4).\u000a\u000aI also can never recommend Scar Symmetry enough.

aVMany are saying Christian, which I agree with. However, another true contender is Alissa White-Gluz, originally of The Agonist and now Arch Enemy. She is effectively Christian's female counterpart. \u000a\u000aFor your consideration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jud_SnKTlY\u000a\u000aThe unfortunate part of her joining Arch Enemy is that now you only get half the package; Arch Enemy is harsh vocals only.

aVGoing with Christian here as well. Bjorn following close behind. I just wish Christian had more material to choose from. I cant understand how Scar Symmetry can put out the masterpiece that was Holographic Universe and then lose Christian due to creative differences. Seriously, that album should have been the catalyst for one of the greatest metal, let alone melodeath, bands we've seen in recent years.

aVI just listened to one of Miseration's songs for the first time actually. Interested for sure. But I do believe he's still active with Miseration and Solution .45. Not so sure about TFAM though, which would be a shame because I really enjoyed SOT.
p2862
aVIt wasn't due to creative differences. I saw in an interview with Per that it was because Christian insisted on handling an even bigger part of the finances of the band.
p2863
aVMine would be Tobias Netzell. The only other person that could compete with him is Christian Alvestam. \u000a\u000aTobias just has this incredibly deep and brutal growl that I think is amazing when you also consider the fact that he's a very awesome singer. The part that I really like about him, and by extension Christian, is that they can switch from doing these brutal, demonic growls to these beautiful, angelic cleans in an instant.

aVAnders Friden was great, but only from Jester Race to Clayman. Jukka Pelkonen is good too.

VIt's an awesome album. But I'm kind of disappointed at the mixing of Ephemeral on the album. The backing guitars and drums are much more muted on the album than they were on the Ephemeral single album they put out.
p2928
aVI actually like it, and think it fits the rest of the album much better than the earlier EP version. That one sounded much "brighter", and it would have stood out from the sound of the other songs.

aVFavorite songs so far? I seriously cannot decide... As of right now it would have to be a tie between Collapsing Words and Revelations. The entire album is simply amazing. It has been a long time since I enjoyed every song on an album.
p2933
aVWell, I have it as Revelations being the best, in a dog fight with Ephemeral. Collapsing Words, Black Heart Rebellion, While We Sleep and The River are up there too (I exclude Primeval Dark, but it is a great piece of it as well).\u000aInsomnium hasn't had an album this consistently strong since Above a Weeping World (imo). Only weakness here is that I'm not a super fan of Lose to Night, but otherwise I put it on par (we'll see if this one has the same lasting power) with AaWW (my current favorite album period.). It's a huge grower album though.

p2962
aVI think I saw on their Facebook they're getting stuck into doing a 4th.\u000a\u000aAm I alone in having very little idea what the lyrics are for most death metal?
p2963
aVI know they're currently in the studio for a 4th, but when you have bands like Insomnium (6 now) and Dark Tranquillity (a lot) that are at the head of the genre, only having 3 albums makes you want more ;P\u000a\u000aBe'Lakor do no wrong in song writing - although some songs are more grow-y then others - so I just want some more, although I understand that song writing at such a high level consistently will take time to make it jive just right.\u000a\u000aDepending on the band I can make about half (note : listening to this stuff for about 5 years now) to most of the lyrics from most death metal these days, but some make it real hard, but that's just the nature of all the distortion that goes into making those tones.\u000a\u000aHowever - especially with Insomnium and Be'Lakor - they are most definitely worth googling to read. You gain a whole other level of appreciation. In fact, I only know this part (~ 3:30-4 min mark of this song) because I googled it, loved it so much, and practiced it for a while ;P

aVWhat? Amon Amarth is straight up melodic death metal with viking themed lyrics.

p2974
aVEnsiferum is more folk metal I think.
p2975
aVEnsiferum isn't in any way black metal.
p2976
aVThat's because they are viking metal.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, listen to their first album again, it is full of black metal riffs.
p2977
aVtrying to think, guardians is a straight up folk style song, treacherous is agian more folk metal. goblin dance maybe?
p2978
aVGoblin Dance and Old Man both have very prominent black metal riffs in them. There are a few other riffs strewn throughout the album. Also, the harsh vocals on the album are way closer in range and style to black metal than death metal. I'm not saying they are black metal, but they are certainly influenced by black metal.
p2979
aVYeah but they actually don't sing much about vikings during that time period, and yeah jari's vocals are definitely blackened. Most of ensiferums music is about finnish folklore not nordic so really they are finnish folk metal.

aVI must be the one melodeath fan that does not like that band.  I'm an anomaly. 
p3025
aVA lot of more "refined" fans don't like them as much because they kinda have the same sound on all thier records. However for someone getting into the genre they are one of the most basic(possibly over-simplistic but yeah) representation of the genre.

(lp3047
VI would give Be'lakor, and Omnium Gatherum a listen if you like Insomnium. I don't really like OG's early albums because of the vocalists singing style. Their most recent stuff is phenomenal, however. All three of Be'lakors albums are incredible, though. Their one of those bands where you have to dedicate a good hour just listening to them, because they have so many songs that run over 6 minutes.
p3048
aVBe'lakor and Omnium Gatherum. Exactly what I thought of when I read OPs post.
p3049
aVBe'Lakor (All 3 albums), Omnium Gatherum (particularly New World Shadows, Beyond and The Redshift a tiny bit) and Insomnium basically go hand in hand, in my books.\u000a\u000aI'd say it's worth looking at Words of Farewell (both albums) and Dark Tranquillity too (I'd say the big 4 are Gallery, Damage Done, Character and Fiction for DT). WoF offer a very similar kind of atmospheric focus (similar to OG and Insomnium).\u000a\u000aEDIT : I should add... feel free to PM/Ask if you want more suggestions
p3050
aVHell yeah words of farewell and DT are another two incredible bands
p3051
aVGive eternal tears of sorrow a go. Their sound changes across albums a bit though, I'm partial to the recent most 2 or 3. \u000a\u000aWintersun. Perfection right there \u000a\u000aKalisia. Only one album but it's fantastic \u000a\u000aWhispered. Great melodeath with heavy Asian elements \u000a\u000aI've been on a Kalmah, arch enemy, and skyfire kick lately as well. \u000a\u000aEdit. Whispered has heavy Asian elements not again elements... 
p3052
aVOh lawdy, I love me some Wintersun. They're not my go-to folk band (that'd be Eluveitie), but it's good stuff.\u000a\u000aQueued up albums from the rest. Thanks!
p3053
aVAt The Gates is essential :)\u000a
p3054
aVIn Flames and Dark Tranquility were what got me into MeloDeath.
p3055
aVYou could also try Noumena, anatomy of life and absence are good.

sVFavorite Insomnium Song?
p3060
(lp3061
VMobile, so I can't link it, but Through the Shadows and The Killjoy are both excellent. Through the Shadows has a siiiiick guitar melody, and The Killjoy is just so damn catchy.
p3062
aVThrough the shadows has an amazing opening riff.  I look forward to seeing it played live this winter when they hit my area.  
p3063
aVIn the Groves of Death is what introduced me to melodeath. The lyrics were so poetic. 
p3064
aV[Last Statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5WdYnkVmPw)\u000a\u000aMy favorite Insomnium song from my favorite Insomnium album.\u000a\u000a"Don't forget me. Don't you forget me. Burn a candle for me... when you can."
p3065
aVThe feeling Friman put into that solo is quite something
p3066
aVHas to be [Down With The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yY6R_1MXd0) for me.\u000a\u000aClosely followed by Mortal Share and Ill Starred Son.
p3067
aVThere's a reason I call Insomnium the "Kings of the Outro". The ending of their songs are always the hit.\u000a\u000a"Mortal Share" - Forever and always. I've listened to it over 2500 times and I still get the same chill as the outro pulls in. My favorite song, period, and the reason "Above a Weeping World" remains my #1 album (apart from the greatness that is everything else on that album).\u000a\u000a"Revelations" - Same feel as Mortal Share, just not as strong. I'm a Vanhala fan so that helps.\u000a\u000a"Ephemeral" - The album version over the EP version. There's just something about that ending.\u000a\u000a"Out to the Sea" - Seriously, Vanhala.\u000a\u000a"Down With The Sun" - Just a classic.\u000a\u000aHonorable mention to "Last Statement" for getting me out of a tough place mentally with that stellar outro that brings me to tears more often then not.
p3068
aVNever thought of it that way, but you're definitely right about the Kings of the Outro. Last Statement is my #1 favorite as far as outros go. I also love the ending to While We Sleep. It's like somebody suddenly sucks all the air from the room, silencing the song. 
p3069
aVVanhala is a guitar wizard.  Nothing more, nothing less.  
p3070
aVEphemeral 
p3071
aVDeath walked the earth, daughter of the moon, in the halls of awaiting, black water, drawn to black. Damn I don't know every song almost! Such an amazing band. Can't wait to see them live in January 
p3072
aVSame.  It can't come soon enough!  Last band I saw like them was Swallow the Sun and half their set was one song.  Good show, but poor setlist choice.  
p3073
aVIm all over Above The Weeping World, it is my absolute favorite album from them. Through The Groves Of Death, At The Gates Of Sleep, Last Statement etc.\u000a\u000aWeather The Storm is also something id like to hear more of. Stanne does a brilliant guest-performance in it. His voice really fits!\u000a\u000aI have yet to be disappointed by an album from Insomnium :)
p3074
aV"Weather the Storm"... I wonder what Insomnium are going to play when they come over with Dark Tranquillity, hm?
p3075
aVDrawn To Black is hands down my favorite track by these gods. The chorus is a poem by Francis William Bourdillon and awesome I might add, \u000a\u000a"The night has a thousand eyes, and the day but one, yet the light of a bright world dies, with a dying sun." \u000a\u000a"The mind has a thousand eyes, and the heart but one, yet the light of a whole life dies, when love is done."\u000a\u000aThe riff that plays during the chorus is just catchy as hell too.
p3076
aVYeah, that has to be one of my favorites along with At the Gates of Sleep.  
p3077
aVI agree. :)
p3078
aVI like the dual song to song flow of The Primeval Dark and While We Sleep. It's essentially a one song experience for me.
p3079
aV[deleted]
p3080
aVI don't really know the band too well. Haven't had the time. I only know the song While We Sleep. I suppose that's my favorite then.
p3081
aVThe River and Daughter of the Moon. Also, I love the guitar solo from Promethean Song.

p3084
aVThere are so many of them, and many have already been posted by others. But one of my favorites that has not been mentioned is [Death Walked The Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRmPcgA-JU4), especially thanks to the opening riff!
p3085
aVUnsung will always be number one, but Down with the Sun, Weather the Storm, and through the shadows will follow close behind.  Obviously they have tons of other good ones, but those are my favorite.
p3086
aVLol, glad everyone has some input.  Consensus seems to be that Mortal Share is a favorite among most fans.  \u000a\u000aOne for Sorrow is also a favorite of mine when I feel like shit.\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZMWKCgvaDY\u000a\u000a  Does anyone know if Niilo does the cleans for this one?  Somewhere I read that he did the cleans for that album but for whatever reason, on the new album they got passed off to the guitarist.  \u000a\u000aIf he did, why the fuck doesn't he do cleans more?  The guitarists clean vocals are horrendous live.  
p3087
aVIt's Friman, Nillo has those kind of low, creaky cleans in the background. If you want an example of Nillo cleans, go to "The Elder". Probably the best example.\u000a\u000aFriman's cleans are getting better live, but still nothing amazing.
p3088
aVThe Elder is fucking great.  I totally forgot about this album.  
p3089
aV"Revelation" - the harmonized guitar leads during the chorus can only be described as downright gorgeous to listen to and Vanhala's solo at the end is incredibly climactic and emotive.
p3090
aVInsomnium writes some of the best lyrics. Its so hard to pick just one song but Weather the Storm has gotten me through some tough times.
p3091
aVWeather the storm, mostly because the colaboration of Mikael Stanne.
p3092
aVI'd go with "Down with the sun", this song introduced me to Insomnium. After that I enjoyed the earlier albums as well, great band. Really looking forward to seeing them live soon.
p3093
aVIt really is hard to chose an actual favorite but I quite like [Lay of the Autumn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYU0YRuiESQ) along with pretty much the whole Above the Weeping World album .. [Drawn to Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBXBnpiMuqA) and [In the Groves of Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9QCK6l6gKg) stand out the most to me though.\u000aNeedless to say, there really isn't a single song that I totally dislike. (The Promethean Song being my least favorite to date, though it's certainly not bad).
p3094
aVPromethean is really non climatic and drawn out.  
p3095
aV[Inertia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXGQr5Fq2lM) is probably my favorite Insomnium song these days, awesome buildup on that song and great ending as with any Insomnium song! Can't wait to see them in New York in January.

VVery good album. I think it's a lot slower than Fires of Life, but I still like it all the same. I'm really digging the clean vocals as well. Wasn't really a fan when I first heard them but they have really grown on me \u000a\u000aStill though, it doesn't have that same ferocity and speed that fires of life had, which for me is what made that album so good. They do have that ferocity on God of a New World, but I just wish they went back to their Fires of Life style.

p3256
asVSonic Syndicate - Before You Finally Break (Feat. Björn 'Speed' Strid)
p3257
(lp3258
VThis guy doesn't have the vocal chops to stand and bang with Strid. 
p3259
aVI love me some Speed Strid and I really enjoyed the first few Sonic Syndicate albums, but this song feels very boring to me.  I thought Speed's vocals in "Collapsing" by Demon Hunter improved an average song to an fairly decent metalcore song.  Unfortunately, "Before you Finally Break" is just not piquing my interest.
p3260
aVAt work, haven't even listened to it, and I might not even remember to, but I will upvote anything to do with Strid.  Headvoice and manly singing (ala strid, Jesse Leach, etc) needs to be a bigger thing.  I would really, really hate to see it die along with the few big bands that utilize it.\u000a\u000aBands need to realize that singing like a chick isn't the only way to sing clean.  Manly singing with a bit of blues rasp and some headvoice is the ultimate metal vocal styling IMO, and is CRIMINALLY underutilized.  
p3261
aV&gt;Bands need to realize that singing like a chick isn't the only way to sing clean\u000a\u000aHere's a tip for you\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yOAc1PHNmc\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfHs4FDLGYE\u000a\u000aIt's not blues or rasp (God i'd love to get a melo-death band that uses clean vocals similar to Jorn Lande or Russell Allen) but he avoids the whole singing like a chick
p3262
aVYeah. It's pretty bland. I liked Nathan better when he was singing for The Hollow Earth Theory. Their last album We Rule the Night wasn't that great either compared to the 3 previous albums. Maybe this new album will be better... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Syndicate_(album)
p3263
aVNothing from Sonic Syndicate has really appealed to me after the first 3 albums. Even their third album felt like it was missing something. I'm always willing to give them a chance, though.
p3264
aVLoving their new stuff! We Rule the Night kinda turned me off from listening to them. Glad they're releasing more stuff in tune with my tastes!
p3265
aVThe only redeeming factor in this song is the fact that Strid is one sick ass motherfucker.
p3266
aVThis would've been a good song if Strid was the only singer, the other guy is fucking awful. Weak growls and horrible clean vocals
p3267
asVUnleashed - Where Is Your God Now (New Song)
p3268
(lp3269
sVWhy is Be'lakor not touring the world yet?
p3270
(lp3271
VApart from the fact that touring outside Australia for them would cost a ton of money, and that considering they are household in MDM circles but not worldwide (I mean, Insomnium haven't even headlined an NA tour yet, to my knowledge... last 2 have been behind Epica + Alestorm and then their upcoming one with Dark Tranquility).\u000a\u000aAs with many things in life, it's probably a money or logistics issue. That, and I would think most bands from Europe don't tour the entire world until after 3 to 4 albums.
p3272
aVYou forgot the part where a lot of European bands plan their tours around Festival Season in West/Northern Europe.  Since a ton of the bands we all like are EU citizens, cost to live and tour in Germany or Norway if you're a swede isn't nearly as much as it would be to tour North America for a month.  Niggas can just drive or take the ferry in between countries.  \u000a\u000aA lot of European bands also write/record or tour America and other parts of the world during winter.  \u000a\u000aAs odd as it is, Festival season really is what a lot of bands seem to structure themselves around. Even American bands like Cannibal Corpse will be gone all summer in Europe from May-September.  \u000a\u000a\u000aDon't know if this makes sense, but it's 1AM and I think I conveyed my points....I think.  \u000a\u000aMoney and that festival season mah niqqas.  No surprise that a band from the middle of fucknowhere in the metal scene sense at least can't get off the ground and get on a sustainable touring lifestyle.  Unless you're loaded with cash or have a job where you can just walk in and be like, "Hey bOss, I'm taking 3 months off to tour Europe, okay?", it's a bit hard for bands that didn't get big in the early 2000's to get off the ground.  \u000a\u000aI forgot what band it was, might have been George Kollias or Derkek Roddy from Nile, but they said you should expect to go in debt at least $3,000 every month long tour you do, if you don't have all that months money paid off and your estimated tour cost of living x2.  \u000a\u000aOn the contrary, Johan Hegg of Amon Amarth literally used to sell cheese at a store in Sweden and has always been able to take time off to tour starting in the late 90's.  True shit.  
p3273
aVBeing from NA, I wouldn't say "Forgot" more then "Not aware of". I'm no "melodeath touring expert". Just providing what I knew. I know Insomnium in an interview spoke of bringing Be'Lakor over to Europe for a tour together, but when they sat down and tried to figure out the logistics and financial side of things, it just didn't make sense to do so. That was mainly what I was going off on.\u000a\u000aYou do bring up good points though.
p3274
aVAs an avid MDM fan I've never heard of them, what track can you recommend?
p3275
aVIf I were to say which one on each album that hooked me in...\u000a\u000aNeither Shape Nor Shadow\u000a\u000aFrom Scythe to Sceptre\u000a\u000aAbeyance
p3276
aVLiterally any of their music. All of their songs are phenomenal. Wintersun and Be'lakor are the only two bands who I believe are flawless. Not a single song I dislike by both bands.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I'd recommend giving Abeyance and Venator a listen. Both are great.\u000a\u000aLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYBgWgjjgxQ
p3277
aV&gt; what track can you recommend?\u000a\u000aAll of them.\u000a\u000a

aVListen through the [albums](https://www.youtube.com/user/belakorband/videos?sort=p&amp;view=0&amp;flow=grid) and find your favorites, all of them are great. Personal favorite must be Remnants though
p3282
aVRemnants\u000a\u000aThe Dream and the Waking\u000a\u000aA Natural Apostasy
p3283
aVI believe they are touring Europe in 2015. Also, I believe they got real demanding jobs and the band is just a hobby/part-time thing i think. 
p3284
aVBe'lakor have toured outside of Australia, I saw them at Summer Breeze festival in Germany a couple of years ago. 
p3285
aV2010 or 2012?  I was there for 2010.  My first OA festival and first time outside the states.  It was glorious.  I wish I had seen them back then.
p3286
aVNot sure, I've been there 2010/2011/2012/2014 I guess it was 2012 when they were there. I didn't think much of them at the time and we left after the first song or two. Wish I'd stayed.
p3287
aVI've seen 3 bands from australia i had never heard of supporting bands in the uk. I reckon it's just about getting a band willing to take them on tour.
p3288
aVDamn, I would buy the shit out of a ticket to a Be'lakor show in Houston.

VFrom their upcoming album with their new singer. Not sure how I feel about it yet. Pretty good song, but only kind of sounds like the band's sound.
p3298
aVLove it. Heavier but with the very Raunchy-sounding chorus. Can't wait to check the whole album out.
p3299
aVYeah. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about it, but it's growing on me after a couple listens. I like their new singer...was a bit of a fan of HAARP Machine anyway.
p3300
aVI found out about this song a few days ago and was kind of meh for the first few moments. Then I got to the chorus and I knew this was going to be great. Still, I'm gonna miss their second singer a lot. I really liked his style in DPR onward.
p3301
aVI agree. But the more I listen to this track, the more the beginning of the song grows on me.

p3317
aVI saw them in NYC at their gig here on the 4th, loved it! DT was amazing too.
p3318
aVActually,  just realized that the show is tonight. Thought it was tomorrow for some reason. \u000aSuper pumped! 
p3319
aVThankfully you didn't miss it! That would've been a crime!
p3320
aVJust got home from the show.  Insomnium killed it. I had barely enough to make it through Dark trans set.
p3321
aVEnjoy man, I'm sure you won't be disappointed!
p3322
aVI only know mortal share by them, but that was pretty sick!
p3323
aVThanks! 
p3324
aVMan I can't imagine how much practice that takes
p3325
aVIts pretty funny that you said this. When we first choose to play this song. I (Red guitar player) looked at the sheet music, and I thought to myself "Seems pretty simple to me" Only reason I said that because it LOOKED like there weren't any crazy lines or sections. \u000a\u000aOf course it was the opposite. The downpicking section for the verse in Mortal Share was extremely challenging. And the middle section of that song to had a crazy part. \u000a\u000aAnyways, I digress! Thanks for listening to it as well as the kind words mate!
p3326
aVLove it.  A few comments:\u000a\u000aClean up the keys at the beginning.  They were blended together too much, and it made it kind of dissonant, and not in a good way.  Your goal with that kind of piano work is to make it sound like bells.  You're trying to emulate that chiming sound, and get it clear as crystal. Listen to Chopin's Posthumous C sharp minor nocturne to hear what I'm talking about, the way the melody is clearly delineated.  Clear, concise notes.  Also, the bass and melody were the same volume and intensity, you want the bass to be more subservient to the melody.\u000a\u000aGuitar sounded loud compared to other parts of the music, but it's understandable as you're playing the guitar and not the drums.  It just kind of drowned out the vocals and drums.
p3327
aVDo you mean bass as rhythm guitar? Or bass guitar? We didn't record any bass guitar. Just used the original track and played with it. As we could not find a backing track. Listening back on it. The rhythm guitar could have been turned down a few notches. \u000a\u000aDUDE. I love Chopin. I could play the piano better, I would just play his works all day. \u000a\u000aThanks for the thought out compliment. It seriously helps when people say things like this. Reminds me to not fall into mediocrity and to work hard to improve. Hoping down the line to be decently skilled in mixing tracks! \u000a\u000aThanks again man! Keep the horns high! As well as support the beauty of classical music! 
p3328
aVBass as in the lower register of the piano.  The entire first half was about the piano at the beginning, as I'm a pianist.  I love metal, but can't really judge you on that part (not that I would, because it's fucking awesome).
p3329
aVAhhh, Yes I understand! Will take note mate!

p3351
aVCaught your set as well, good stuff.  \u000a\u000a\u000aThe band before you though (Didn't catch their name), when the singer tried to have the crowd fill in for some of their vocals that was brutally awkward.  Felt kinda bad when it was dead silent :(
p3352
aVLol, I think you're referring to us actually XD yea, it didn't work as well as I had hoped. The band after us was withering  Soul
p3353
aVHaha oh fuck, well foot in mouth on my part, didn't realize there was 3 openers (got there late due to work) Either way, your set was good as well minus that minor part :P 
p3354
aVThanks! I wanted to try announcing what I wanted people to say before the silence of that song (The Reaper Cometh it's called), as opposed to before the song itself, but as I said, didn't work well. Oh well, ya learn :P
p3355
aVI had the same reaction. I'd always known about them, and I'd had Above The Weeping World for a good long time before seeing them, but nothing could have prepared me for how insanely melodic and beautiful their leads and all were.

p3360
aVIt was amazing, of course.

p3433
aVThey are from the same recording session as TLI. So it's pretty impressive that they are so good, even compared to the original double album.
p3434
aVEven though a lot of reviews said that this was the 'weak' track on the album, I don't see it. I love this song, because it's a very bright lead in to the end of the first disk, and that bridge section in the middle is mega.\u000a\u000aBjorn's vocals, both screaming and singing, is just phenomenal on this album.
p3435
aVDid they really? Just goes to show that a lot of reviewers have no idea what they're talking about. This track is one of the best! And I agree, his vocals are outstanding; one of the best in the business for sure.
p3436
aVWell, to be fair, they did say that saying it was the weakest was a bit mean because the entire standard of the album was ridiculous.\u000a\u000aI went and saw them live about this time last year. Bjorn blasting out Tongue full bore was a thing of beauty
p3437
aVStill, I can't believe they called it the weakest! I guess music is subjective after all :)\u000a\u000aI, too, was able to see them live last year. I actually half expected them to be bad for some reason, but I was blown away.
p3438
aVI listened to this album religiously, then was fortunate enough to see them play some of it live. Unfortunately I drank a bit then got wrecked in the moshpit beforehand while Black Guard played. Actually, that was also fortunate. Edit: whoops, I said Black Flag.

aVIts kinda short but overall really fucking good. My favorite thing about these guys is that they write songs with some very thoughtful and intelligent lyrics. This album is no exception. In fact i think that this album has some of their smartest lyrics to date.
p3471
aVThis album absolutely crushes from start to finish. It is technical heavy and in your face. Some of the songs feel a little busy and the choruses don't seem to hook me as hard as the first 2 albums though.

I mean he doesn't sound bad, but he's just garbling syllables with the occasional english word in it, with no rhythmic timing either.

p3621

VDamn that was good, almost spot on. Especially on the growls
p3623
aVThis video is a great representation of why I love Christian's vocals so much. Strain nails the growls, but doesn't come anywhere near the quality of Christian's cleans. Christian has power in both the growl and the clean. 
p3624
aVAll things considered, I don't think anybody could really ever come enough to truly matching Christian's vocals. He's truly one in a million.\u000a\u000aI think Ryan still does good enough, but my only problem with his previous cover is that it sounded like he was trying too hard to repeat or mimic Christian to the point where the cover he did sounded too similar to the original, except slightly lacking in comparison. With the new instrumentals in this version, it's a better cover because it sounds quite good but can stand on its own compared to the original instead of sounding too similar.\u000a\u000aI remembered somebody posting some other band's cover of Scar Symmetry's Morphogenesis on this sub sometime back, and I thought that had the opposite problem. It was a cover that did a good enough job sounding different from the original, but it didn't sound very good (to me at least; I really didn't like that cover).

p3673
(lp3674
VMaybe MyGrain and their self-titled 2011 album. Fairly similar blend and sound to my ears:\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko7gvz80ttA\u000a\u000aOr perhaps Nightrage and their 2007 album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-rHbDL7Ra8\u000a\u000aMaybe Scar Symmetry, with an occasionally slightly harder edge: \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQagTCycQ4s\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5aB9bW5B00\u000a\u000aWovenwar is also with a harder edge than Soilwork, but good clean singing and lots of melodic stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7veBHqIEnkI\u000a\u000aFeel free to mention what aspects you like about the soilwork album and I might be able to figure some other recommendations from that. :)
p3675
aVCheers for that! What i love is a powerful clean chorus througout this brutal genre! Example of this is Scar Symmetry The Anomaly, another example of this could be Disarmonia Mundi - Resurrection Code/ perdition haze; Dark Age - Outside the Inside
p3676
aVYou considered Sonic Syndicate yet? "Only Inhuman" and "Love And Other Disasters" are both albums from them that remind me of that era of Soilwork.
p3677
aVFrom them i have only listened to Denied, i like them but some seems like they repeat the same formula..could be wrong though
p3678
aVYou should definitely listen to those albums. Try listening to some Sybreed as well, they're very Soilwork-ish with a hint of industrial/cyber or whatever.
p3679
aVCheers, will do :&gt;
p3680
aVSome of their songs have a hard time standing out from one another, but there are some pretty decent songs among those two albums. If you're hearing Only Inhuman (since Denied is from that album), I would at the very least suggest checking out Callous, All About Us, and Double Agent 616.\u000a\u000aI'm a bigger fan of Love And Other Disasters. If you get your hands on that album, I suggest checking out Encaged, Jack of Diamonds, and Power Shift.\u000a\u000aSince you're coming from a Soilwork, I guess you could check out Before You Finally Break. It's a Sonic Syndicate song that features the vocalist of Soilwork, although it's off their self-titled release from last year.
p3681
aVDid enjoy that, biased cause Bjorn "speed" is there, i will keep digging. Stuff like the oldies Disarmonia Mundi - Resurrection Code or Killswitch Engage - My Curse
p3682
aVSoilwork is certainly my favorite band of all time. You may be pleased to know that Speed does vocals on several of I. Legion's tracks, such as Beyond Darkness (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iyKsh8uI1m0). \u000a\u000aI will say that the album with Rejection Role on it (figure number five) is rather unique to Soilwork's discography. I feel their use of keyboard is more extensive throughout that album than on any other. There's also a bonus track to that album that few people are aware of, give it a try: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VLqRDcKQSZM\u000a\u000aIf you're wanting to stay within Soilwork, my recommendation for their next track would be Nerve from the album Stabbing the Drama, or Exile from Sworn to a Great Divide. They're similar enough to Rejection Role that you should be well pleased. 
p3683
aVYe i know that one i quite enjoy soilwork and happen to own a phyisical copy of stabbing the drama, was just looking for a band within the melodic scene that kinda resembles them but its rare to find one, some bands like in flames often release tracks from the same vein but its rare, even soilwork doesnt sound much like rejection role
p3684
aV[Rise To Fall - Defying The Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28jDh9HbEp4)\u000a\u000aClean choruses throughout this entire album, heavy synth, melodic.\u000a\u000a\u000aNeptune - Acts of Supremacy (Example song: [Sterile Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_IedPD8YXw), whole album is hard to find).\u000a\u000aProduced by Ettore Rigotti of Disarmonia Mundi, same deal here, very melodic, clean choruses all over the place.\u000a\u000a
p3685
aVlistened to the whole thing thanks, that is more in tune to what i was looking for, his voice isnt as commanding and memorable as Bjorn`s but still pretty enjoyable, maybe soilwork will treat us to a new album right this year!
p3686
aVHey np, cheers.
p3687
aVIt's a tricky one because like you said even soilwork doesn't sound like rejection role typically. I'll give it a try though.\u000a\u000aFor one you might want to try "The Stranded - Survivalism Boulevard". It has some guys from disarmonia mundi playing in it if I recall correctly so there might be something there. Haven't listened to it much so can't say if there are enough clean vocals.\u000a\u000a"In Vain - Ænigma" is an album that does clean vocals really well I think. Especially on the first two tracks. It's tad heavier/darker than some of the stuff mentioned here so might be a miss.\u000a\u000a"Noumena - Anatomy of Life" is one that comes to mind as well. The clean vocals are female and the contrast between verses and choruses is a lot bigger but it is still one of the few bands with clean vocals left in my playlists.\u000a\u000a"Eventide - The Beast and the Machine" is one that fits the description. The way they do the clean vocals differ quite a bit from track to track so check more than one song.
p3688
aVLoved Eventide, will make sure to give the other ones a proper go when i have time. Cheers for the tips!

aVI really feel I'm one of the only ones that really dislike Soilworks last 3-4 albums including their newest that everybody praises. The highlight for me is Stabbing The Drama so maybe that's why.

aVI feel like one of the few who isn't a fan of Soilwork (their general sound really, since they spawned a lot of bands with that sound), additionally Bjorn's vocals don't do it for me.\u000a\u000aI recognize that he's good, and see why it appeals to people, but it just doesn't appeal to me.

aVReally? People used to say that the cleans didn't really fit in the music and later they got rid of them. 
p3811
aVYeah, but that's just me. I really like clean vocals that pop up in melodeath, so even if they aren't too great or don't fit terribly well it's usually a plus for me. I can see why others wouldn't like them though, they do kind of clash with the rest of the song.

(lp3814
VThis is not In Flames.\u000a\u000aThey should SERIOUSLY consider changing the name of the band. Not just because of this song, but because of everything I've heard from this album so far. Last one was decent. This looks bad.
p3815
aVhow about passenger?
p3816
aVI'm a bit confused here?
p3817
aVThat's the name of the [other band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_\u005c(Swedish_band\u005c)) Anders was in.  It blows.
p3818
aVReally, putting In Flames on this is just to try to get sales off their long-earned fanbase.
p3819
aVI'm guessing they are trying to reach a larger audience
p3820
aVOr, you know, they're making music THEY WANT TO MAKE, not what you want to hear.
p3821
aVThey want to make generic pop-rock?
p3822
aVApparently so.
p3823
aVEvery time I see a new In Flames track, I think "maybe this will be the one that restores my enjoyment of them" and every time I'm disappointed. With the total genre shift (no harsh vocals, no sweeping melodies, and in all honestly, nothing metal) they've undergone, as u/Drugoli suggested, they might as well change the name of the band.  
p3824
aVWhat the hell happened to In Flames, they're sounding like a pop band now.  This is terrible.
p3825
aVJesper...come back...please...
p3826
aVHorrible video.
p3827
aVI really don't like the direction the band is going in
p3828
aVSame.
p3829
aVIts so saddening for me, the band that got me into metal is not even creating metal anymore. Hope there is at least one good song off their new album. If not, lets hope for them to bounce back on their next album. Deeply upsetting. 
p3830
aVRusted Nail has been growing on me a little, but this song just never catches my attention at all.
p3831
aVThis will be the first In Flames album i wont be buying.  The last two albums alot of people seemed to hate the direction they went but in my opinion they were still really enjoyable, A Sense of Purpose is even one of my favorite albums.  But this i keep trying to find something in it i like, but keep coming up with nothing.
p3832
aVI actually found that pretty underwhelming when I heard it today. I was pretty excited because it was something new from In Flames and nothing more, really. I was set on buying Siren Charms a few weeks ago when I just heard the news that In Flames was doing a new album in the first place, but now I'm starting to think that won't be the case.\u000a\u000aTo be completely honest, I actually think some of the newer stuff from In Flames was decent. Sounds of a Playground Fading has some tracks I really like, as well as Sense of Purpose. Come Clarity is even one of my all-time favorite albums. I also liked Passenger (not at first though; I bought the album years ago after hearing the first two tracks and then felt let down by the rest of the album, but I appreciated the album for what it was a few years later. It's decent if you want something kind of grungy and mellow.).\u000a\u000aThis song... it seriously doesn't even sound like Sounds of a Playground Fading. This made Sounds of a Playground Fading look like Jester Race. I guess I can appreciate In Flames for not wanting to stagnate, but there's a fine balance between making 10 albums that all sound the same and straying a bit too far from what everybody knows you for.
p3833
aVI think I'll be listening to the album via spotify before deciding to buy it myself, it's just the complete opposite way of ASOP and sounds of imo this song. I can understand if they have one maybe two of these types of songs on the album such as with Liberation and the Attic on sounds of.
p3834
aVChrist... it's like listening to fucking Coldplay or something.
p3835
aVI enjoyed Rusted Nail, but this song is just plain boring. Not sure whether i'll end up getting this album or not.

p3846
aVTo be fair, Equillibrium got me into folk after finding my melodic death stuff a bit stale.  There isn't a song I dislike on Sagas. And the version of Rekreatur I have has some sweet acoustic versions on it.

aVGotta disagree. For me Scar Symmetry has always been about the compositions, interesting harmonic structures, and of course the guitar solos. The incredible vocals have always just been a plus in my mind. I also think Roberth is a much better growler, and I like how Lars has more of a power metal style vocal rather than a pop style. Absolutely love Christian's vocals though.

VIm alternating between Beyerdynamic DT990 and DT770 depending on if I want to be able to hear what's going on around me. Using the DT770 is for fully immersed mode!\u000a\u000aTo drive this I have a Fiio E09K together with a Fiio E17. The sound is on the warm side, but I love it!
p4004
aVOriginal Acoustic Energy AE1 speakers, John Shearne phase 2 amplifier and a Sony CDP-311 CD player. Old equipment but it's fantastic: incredibly crisp and well-balanced. The source is probably the weak link in the system, either being a laptop or the CD player depending on what I'm listening to. I'll agree with the guy below who said that real speakers are a must for Metal, too. 
p4005
aVI'm using a Burson HA160-DS, which is a DAC and Headphone Amplifier combo. All discrete solid state, heaps of resolution and power. My headphones are some Lawton Audio modified Denon AH-D2000's.\u000a\u000aMy library is pretty much all FLAC (very few exceptions) and I can say that my setup has definitely made a difference. The Denon headphones are known for being very bass heavy, but the modifications tighten that up, improve the soundstage and positioning and balance. The Burson has a strong bass response, seemingly unlimited power to drive and deliver the blast beats. It has superb PRAT (Pace Rythm Attack Timing), which makes the drums sound almost pneumatic sometimes. No matter the complexity nothing gets lost. You can hear the cymbals from all directions and drum rolls go around your head.\u000a\u000aMy rig is pretty expensive ($1500AUD), but for me the investment was worth it. Having heard a lot of headphones the Sennheiser's were decent, but they didn't me away. But then again, they were friendly on the wallet. The headphones are always the most important, but don't forget the electronics.\u000a\u000aSubreddits such as /r/headphones are helpful, and /r/audiophile (although audiophile doesn't really cater to new questions, but there are no other suitable subs to direct you to). I prefer Head Fi (www.head-fi.org) to /r/headphones for technical information and reviews. If you have any questions, let me know and I'll try to help.

aVI have a somewhat expensive and powerful home stereo.  I won't name components because I'm not 100% happy with it, but most people would be pretty impressed with the sound.\u000a\u000aI found that once I added a powered sub, there was no going back to anything else.  That one piece gave the music that physical component - I can *feel* the music the way I can on the rail of a live show.\u000a\u000aOne thing I find though is the clearer the sound, the less loud it sounds to me.  Yes, I've had my hearing tested and it's fine(somehow).  So I'm always disappointed it's not louder, even though it is.
p4010
aV598 is a great starting place for headphones. A lot of the muddyness you are hearing could just be from the musics studio mixing, most metal isn't exactly known for being "clean." \u000a\u000a\u000aI've been running a Schiit Valhalla + HD650 + Fiio E17dac for awhile now, and this setup sounds good for every kind of music I've thrown at it, including metal. Perfect amount of highs/mids/lows for my tastes.\u000a\u000aI have some Grado225i that are great for most types of metal/rock, but not so great for anything else and also some PSB M4U2 that I use for public places that sound pretty good all types of music.\u000a\u000aFor speakers, I use some VanatooT1 on my desk and a b&amp;w683 +rotelRA12 setup for the living room, both sound amazing for metal. I dont get to listen loudly as much as I would like though.
p4011
aVATH-M50x + Xonar U3 is the best combo under $250 if you ask me. They sound great for all music, not just metal. But these are the best low-mid impedance headphones I have heard under $200. The Xonar U3 is a great portable audio card as well. I used to use a X-Fi Titanium HD in my desktop but it wasn't portable and the Xonar U3 sounds the same through my speakers and headphones, so I just run everything through the U3 now.

aVPowered Behringer Truths B2301A, except recently one developed a nasty static from the tweeter.

p4014
aVI have tried and/or listened to alot of setups over the years. And when it comes to Metal, and especially the more heavy kind like melodeath, death or metalcore there is no substitution for real speakers. Metal is also one of the hardest things for a speaker to play, and will usually sound like shit on a average stereo. Another problem is that most "Metal" is recorded in poor quality. \u000a\u000aWalk in to any serious Hi-Fi shop and ask if you could test some of the better audio equipment they have. Take with you your setup for comparison.\u000a\u000aAlways use a good source!\u000aFor pc the JRiver media center is the best player i have found.\u000aIf you dont want to download music or buy, here is a list of Hi-Fi metal on spotify (in 320 if you have premium):\u000a\u000ahttp://open.spotify.com/user/ketsjupelvis/playlist/7pWsDoYnF7S6KzMa0bpEqi\u000a\u000aAnd here is my setup.\u000aPioneer LX-90 Reciver, Earthquake Titan Tigris Speakers, Supra sword speaker cables and a High-End pc for source.

aVI know Sounds of a Playground Fading isn't held in high regard by a lot of fans, but I loved it. Fantastic album. I appreciate that they did something new and it was catchy as hell. But I'm still not sold on the new direction they're going with their new material. Haven't really liked anything they've put out for it so far.
p4030
aVI agree wholeheartedly. I very much enjoyed their early stuff; Whoracle through Come Clarity got me interested. But I loved Ropes, Fear is the Weakness, and Darker Times from Sounds of a Playground Fading.
p4031
aVI'm a little biased because Sounds of a Playground is the first In Flames album I heard in full. I had heard a few songs from Whoracle and Come Clarity before, but never bought their albums or anything up until that point. So I love that whole album. But yes, objectively their earlier stuff is better. Still, I don't think the hate for Sounds is warranted.
p4032
aVI love this album.
p4033
aVThis was actually a cool video to get fans in it.\u000a\u000aPeople need to stop hating in flames for what they are and just accept they are different now.
p4034
aVI don't hate them for what they are, I just *wish* they weren't what they are. Just feels like such a bummer when you really liked what they did before.
p4035
aVwhat most people want is them to not change their sound, like metallica.
p4036
aVI don't think there's anything inherently bad with evolving the sound of a band, but the change in In Flames's sound is too drastic and in the wrong direction for many of their old fans.
p4037
aVAnd in the right direction for other fans. In reality it's all opinion and the circlejerk gets old.
p4038
aVThis isn't a circlejerk, just people with opinions. Don't write anything with a different opinion off as just another circlejerk.
p4039
aVThat opinion is spammed everywhere in flames comes up. Circlejerk can be defined by this situation.
p4040
aVWhatever you say, doesn't make it a less valid opinion though. I wouldn't have written anything in the first place if it weren't to explain what people really mean when they get mad at In Flames.
p4041
aVA circle jerk? You mean people who brought the bands popularity to where it is now, the people who backed them and made them famous. They have a right to complain. Without these fans this band would not be as huge as they are. That's why people get upset at this new bullshit sound. It's not an evolution, it's a completely different style. That'd be ok if they didn't try to act like they were going back to their roots, which was the claim with this new CD. Sound familiar? It's the same shit Metallica did with "Death Magnetic" and it was fucking horrendous. This band is doing everything Metallica did to become obsolete (except suing napster) and it's sad to see.
p4042
aVThat's just like, your opinion man.
p4043
aVmaybe its good that In flames have changed their sound. Metallica hasn't done anything remotely interesting in 20 years...
p4044
aVI would kill for another album similar to the jesters race, its what got me into melodeath in the first place.
p4045
aVYou'll never get another Jester's Race for a couple reasons. There is only one member in the band from that time so the creativity and skills are completely different. No one can write melody like Jesper, listen to their stuff post-Jesper it doesn't even have that same foundation that stretches from Lunar Strain to ASOP. They're also not 19 years old anymore they're in a completely different headspace than they were in 1996-97. And finally if they put out 10+ years of the the Jester's Race people would complain about that. Just look at Slayer vs Metallica. People say Metallica sucks cause they "sold out" and they say Slayer sucks cause they've been putting out Raining Blood for 25 years. 
p4046
aVBjorn and Anders are still there from The Jester Race. However, it seems like Bjorn took melodic control starting with STYE. 
p4047
aVIt's not hard to figure out what people want. They want new shit that uses the same formula as the old shit but doesn't sound the same. Metallica said they were "returning to their roots" with Death Magentic, and the only thing that was returned were copies of the CD. In Flames is claiming the same shit with this CD, and it's turning out just as bad. Nobody complains about older Melodeath bands that come out with new shit that keeps the formula (other than band members changing like Arch Enemy).

aVI actually prefer their early stuff, and I think most people share this opinion. For me Hades might even be their best song ever.

aVTheir first two albums are amazing n godly,  but I'd have to disagree on hades, even though it's a bad ass song.

aVPerhaps, you'd like the melodic thrash-death approach of [The Forsaken](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/The_Forsaken/1160) while working out. I'd recommend listening to the songs 'Traces of the Past' or 'Beyond Redemption' to get a taste.\u000a\u000aI also found Dew-Scented's full-length "Impact" to be of a similar vein. (Maybe their other work is better. Didn't explore them more.)\u000a\u000aLastly, if you check out a Mors Principium Est album, let it be "The Unborn". It's riffing is some high-octane melodic shit (and it contains some respite for your poor body and ears). Actually, now that I've started playing the album, let me urge you to check it out (as it's much more melodeath than the two previous).

No need to suggest ones others already have. **Kalmah**, The Black Waltz, is another one you should check out. Maybe **Scar Symmetry**, Pitch Black Progress, also, though not so much early melodeath but still very good.

VListening right now, really positive impression from this.\u000a\u000aGreat mix, going for clarity rather than making the guitars super beefy in the low-range is a nice change of pace from most modern metal. Nice guitar tones overall.\u000a\u000aThe acoustic quieter parts are very nice, very glad you didn't compress it to hell, when a track relaxes it really relaxes, and gives a great contrast and an actual rest from the more energetic parts.\u000aI can't emphasize enough how nice it is to not have it over-produced. \u000a2 and a half tracks in and I'm really excited about the style of songs and melodies you use. It has that sad, almost slightly empty, desolate quality that early Insomnium had. Open production, doesn't sound inappropriately big/deep/massive.\u000a\u000aAwesome vocals, not sure what the lyrics are, but they sound honest and, again, not overprocessed/choreographed.\u000a\u000aThere's not a single weak track here man. Every track seems to know what it wants to do, and does it very well.\u000aLove this album a lot more than the latest Insomnium album, their last 2 didn't do too much for me unfortunately. This has a much more sober, mature, desolate-feeling emotional core, which I love.\u000a\u000aI rarely buy music these days, unfortunately, but if you guys get this up on Bandcamp or something, or if you have a bigger deal currently in the works, let me know cause I'd like to get this in lossless and wouldn't mind parting with some dough to get it.\u000a\u000aAwesome work!\u000a\u000aEDIT: And you're from Finland. I should have guessed. Greetings from an impressed Swede.\u000a\u000aEDIT2: Found your bandcamp link, gave you a couple of Euros for a FLAC copy.

asVSoilwork - Beyond The Infinite EP Preview
p4265
(lp4266
VI hope we can at least get this on Spotify or something. That would be enough for me.\u000a\u000aI'm also reminded of how grateful I am that, while In Flames is doing worse lately, Soilwork is at least better than ever.
p4267
aVI know, Resisting the Current (third track on the preview) sounds absolutely mega! Stabbing the Drama was my gateway album, but bar STAGD, they've just been getting better and better since.
p4268
aVI somewhat agree. Great Divide wasn't that great (that guitar tone was atrocious) but I would say that Stabbing the Drama and before are better. I love all of their shit though. 
p4269
aVThe only album pre-Stabbing that I really love is A Predator's Portrait. That being said, I'm a much bigger fan of the modern stuff compared to the older stuff. \u000a\u000aIf I were to rank Soilwork's albums, it'd be Infinite, Panic, Predator, Stabbing, Chaos, Chainheart, Figure, Steelbath, Great Divide. The top 4 are very closely matched though, in my opinion
p4270
aVThat's a fairly good list, and I guess we can all agree that Great Divide was rather mediocre. It's kind of sad to think that it came out the year after In Flames released Come Clarity, which was at least a good album.\u000a\u000aIf I had to rate them from best to worst, I'd go with Infinite, Predator, Figure, Stabbing, Chaos, Chainheart, Panic, Steelbath, and Great Divide. I like all of them quite a bit except for Great Divide, so ordering them is kind of hard.\u000a\u000aStrange thing for me is I loved Panic Broadcast the year it was out. The very moment it was out, I listened to it like crazy, but a few years later, I find it kind of difficult to go back to it.
p4271
aVI have similar feelings toward The Panic Broadcast...it just hasn't held up like other Soilwork albums.  It is tough for me to rank the Soilwork albums, as they have changed quite a bit in their career.  If I had to, I'd probably go Chaos, Predator, Infinite, Stabbing, Figure, Panic, Chainheart, Steelbath, Sworn.  Really, outside of the bottom 4, the rest are nearly interchangeable.  The only reason I have Steelbath and Chainheart so low is I consider Speed's clean vocals to be an integral part of the Soilwork sound.  Without them, Soilwork sounded like a generic (albeit talented) At the Gates clone.
p4272
aVSpeed's cleans are unbelievable. I saw him live last year when Soilwork played in my home town and he can really just turn it on a switch.\u000a\u000aI've still got a video of Tongue on my phone. If I wasn't right there in the mosh, I wouldn't have believed how mental it was
p4273
aVWhere and when did you see them? :)
p4274
aVAbout this time last year when they did their Australian tour. It was just a mental, mental night! I got fist-bumps from all of the band members! :D
p4275
aVSweet! I was their guitar tech for some time last year but that was during the European part of the tour (which was after the Australian, I think?), so I was hoping you'd say one of those cities haha!\u000a\u000aI totally agree about his vocals, incredibly good every single show.
p4276
aVSweet! That's bloody awesome! Sylvain and David work so well on the guitars together too, I've got some great pictures of them soloing together right in front of me\u000a\u000aJust the energy and the power they had, made even the small venue they played at feel like a stadium
p4277
aVSee, I still think the Panic Broadcast holds up great! I don't quite understand, especially around this sub, the stigma attached to it. I thought the album was extremely well constructed, and every song has held it's own. The only song that has fallen away for me is Enter Dog of Pavlov.\u000a\u000a

aVI guess part of my issue is that they were *so close* to making one of their best albums, but fell a bit short.  There are some catchy riffs and catchy choruses that implant themselves in my brain for days, but I haven't found myself coming back to them as frequently as other Soilwork albums.

If you're a fan, you can look up for [The Ocean - Pelagial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7u6ZSxeI8). I linked the instrumental version of the album, but there is also a version with all the lyrics.\u000a\u000aAll the In Flames tracks mentioned in the comments are great (I'm partial to [Dialogue With The Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po1_lRHCeTU) myself\u000a\u000a[Kalter - Reflexions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxppjKZ_i6g) is pretty good too.\u000a\u000aAnd while not quite melodeath, I've always liked [Death's - Voice Of The Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOsIXpDH_R0).

aVif you ask on their facebook they, or their reps if they don't personally manage it, might respond. I've done this with other bands and had it seen.

VI recently got turned on to **In Vain**. They're a brand new melo-death band with an amazing first album. [Here's the opening song, Against the Grain.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4W7spPmaVk) They do a really good job of mixing clean and harsh vocals, especially in the second half of that song *(Transcend into the atmosphere, transcend into the atmosphere...)*. I also want to draw attention to the closing song of that album, [Floating on the murmering tide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKT2IDFElow) It has a saxophone solo, a fucking *saxophone solo,* how cool is that?
p4378
aVThank you for introducing me to this A- Fucking- Mazing band. Currently listening to Culmination of the Enigma and loving every second of it.
p4379
aVYou are aware they have 2 albums before AEnigma, right? Called "Mantra" and "The Latter Rain" (their actual debut album, from 2007 :P).\u000a\u000aI haven't listened to them yet (just didn't get to that). But I will agree AEnigma is amazing.
p4380
aVI didn't know that! Aenigma was the only one I could find, that just made my day!
p4381
aVHoly shit dude!  Looks like I got some homework tonight.
p4382
aVWords Of Farewell!
p4383
aVCame here for this.\u000a\u000aI hold them on the same level as Insomnium, Be'Lakor, Omnium Gatherum (post-Redshift) and Dark Tranquillity, and that is no small achievement.
p4384
aVFor me, it would have to be [Syndemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2QgiB4daE). [Starkill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMksX04WBA4) would definitely be a very close runner up for me as well.
p4385
aVI wouldn't say favorite, but they're my current obsession. \u000a\u000aTerracide. They just released their first album pretty recently and the song The Forge of Empty Souls is so fucking metal! I love the riffs, the singing(both clean and growls) and the solo! The lyrics are really meaningful too! They're awesome! 
p4386
aVAgree, these guys are unreal. I found them randomly on bandcamp a couple months ago.
p4387
aVMors Principium Est.... Holy shit this band is insane. I've been listening "...And Death Said Live" on repeat!!!
p4388
aVThis. They kind of remind me of Disarmonia Mundi. No other band that I have found is similar, and DM is one of the best melodeath bands of all time.
p4389
aVYou should check out the Stranded if you're into Disarmonia Mundi. It's got two of DM's guys in it and they're really good.
p4390
aVHave you listened to the earlier albums? And Death Said Live is fairly mediocre in comparison.
p4391
aVFucking Eluveitie! Helvetios is the best damn album I've heard in a long time.
p4392
aVFew things :\u000a\u000a1) They've been around for about 10 years (probably more... They already have around 5 albums to their names)\u000a\u000a2) Origins is better then Helvetios, IMO. The second half of the album, including everything from Succellos on, is great. The Silver Sister and Carry the Torch were pleasant surprises for these guys.\u000a\u000a3) Just because I want to keep everything in the same comment chain, they are very much a mix of melodeath with folly instruments and influences. Some songs make it more clear then others (Bloodstained Ground from one of their earlier albums, or the aforementioned section of Origins), but it's evident that they have a Dark Tranquillity-esque style about them.\u000a\u000a4) Their tour with Winter sun last year was insane. And I kind of wish Anna did some more screams in general, because she wrecks them (The one in Sucellos, even if it's only as background, is chilling)
p4393
aVI've honestly just discovered them, but I noticed the huge melodeath influences, hence posting this here. Without the folk instruments they'd be a straight up melodeath band as far as I can tell, but the folky-ness is my favorite thing about them. 
p4394
aVWell, keep on plowing through then! "Slania" and "Spirit" are two really good albums too. Some would say much better then both "Helvetios" and "Origins". The folky-ness definitely adds to the music - they really make it mesh well with the base melodeath sound.\u000a\u000aThey aren't spectacular or groundbreaking, but what they do they do extremely well, and hard to find elsewhere.\u000a\u000aJust keep on enjoying these guys!
p4395
aVIt's exciting to know my new favorite album is considered one of the least awesome by that band.\u000a\u000aP.S. you couldn't stop me if you tried lol.
p4396
aVI've always thought of them as more folk metal than melodeath, but their newest album Origins has definitely swung more towards melodic death metal.  Also I'd say that it's much better than Helvetios.
p4397
aVI'll have to check that out. I'd agree with you, I went ahead with it cause they're wiki page includes melodeath and the only other melodeath band I've been jamming on at all is Amon Amarth and that's just lame to post lol.
p4398
aVI actually didn't even realize they were considered melodeath until about a month ago.  I've seen them live a few times and Chrigel always refers the the band as "pure fucking folk metal".
p4399
aVYeah I'd say that's mostly true. They have some melodeath influences though that are pretty noticeable at times. 
p4400
aVHelvetios was amazing. Truly amazing, my fav album from them by far. Origins was awesome too. 
p4401
aVCan't both be true? Folk Metal just means metal with folk elements. The style of metal isn't specified. I too think Origins is their best so far.

aVOh yeah those guys came out with a fucking epic debut album. Routa Pt. 2 will never get old for me. That intro will never fail to give me feels. Its like Saukonnen declared war on your eardrums and this was a blitzkrieg of awesome brutality.

p4413
aVI really do want to love EToS, but I just can't, and their among my "alright" bands. Their guy that does growls sounds like he's holding back most of the time, and their clean vocalist is too power metally for me. That being said their instramentals are incredible and when the guy that does growls lets loose, it's awesome.
p4414
aVOmnium Gatherum - Beyond is the new melodeath standard IMHO.
p4415
aVI feel like these guys are their own genre of melodeath. Like they're really atmospheric and most of their songs are really awesome slow beat to them and really long like Nightwalkers, Everfields, and Deep Cold. \u000a\u000aTheir first two albums were more standard melodeath, but now I would call them atmospheric melodic death metal.

VHidden Hands was the album that got me into them. Back then I thought they were almost a clone of At The Gates, but that was a good thing to me.
p4465
aVI really love this band. The first time I heard about them was when I saw them live at Mayhem. I had an immediate affinity with them. Honestly though, this isn't their best rhythm work in my opinion. I think an even better riff would either be the intro part of "No God" or "Sound the Surrender" Also, isn't Darkest Hour metalcore? I love metalcore but I don't think they classify as death metal. Maybe melodic metalcore though. 
p4466
aVdefinitely not metalcore. a lot of their contemporaries belonged in the melodic metalcore classification, but DH was always more straightforward melodic death like classic At the Gates, In Flames, and Soilwork. And no breakdowns. 
p4467
aVExactly what I was going to say. THe main thing to me was no breakdowns and always bitching riffs.
p4468
aVMaybe their earlier stuff has some hardcore in it, but I think they migrated over to straight up melodic death right around this album. Undoing Ruin is basically a melodic death metal album, and everything they've done since then I would say is melodic death. But, that's based on seeing them years ago and hearing their very early stuff.

sVSo what do you guys think of Allegaeon's Elements of the Infinite?
p4535
(lp4536
VOverall I think that it's a solid album front to back. The more I listen to it the more I enjoy it, but there are a few things I thought the previous albums did better. While I appreciate Ezra experimenting with a lower register, I think that he sounded more clear and powerful in the higher range. This album, while more progressive, also seems to be lacking the catchiness of their prior works. After listening to Fragments or Formshatter, I'd find myself humming the tunes from the albums for the rest of the day, where as the only track with a similar effect on Elements is 1.618.
p4537
aVReally? I think this album is super rhythmic and catchy. I especially like Our Cosmic Casket because of the rhythm and the lyrics and that ending is just so freaking brutal. Its awesome. \u000a\u000aI think for the most part Ezra stays in his higher range of vocals except for songs like Our Cosmic Casket. The thing i like most about Ezra though is the fact that he can sing lyrics that you wouldn't think would rhyme, but they do when he sings them.\u000a\u000aAnother thing I like about this album is its clear theme: space and science.
p4538
aVIt's interesting, we have vastly different takes on catchiness. I found Cosmic Casket to be the most forgettable track on the album. Everything is tuned so low that it kind of just blends together to me; where as songs like Dyson Sphere and Gravimetric Time Dilation have a nice blend and juxtaposition of highs and lows as well as some sick riffage. \u000a\u000aI do love all of Allegaeon's themes: from astronomy, to philosophy, quantum physics, to genealogy. They, along with their unique technical musicianship, are what really draws me to them.   
p4539
aVI think it's their best album so far. I love what they did with the orchestral tracks, and you just can't beat Biomech II.

p4603
aVCouldn't agree more.
p4604
aVguitars and bass are boring and generic, drums is decent if you take into consideration to what he has to work with but still ends up pretty generic. The overall sound is awful, everything sounds bloaty as fuck and sounds really amateurish. \u000a\u000aThe only decent part of the song is the singer but even there it's just.. the lyrics are just badly written and generic.\u000a\u000aI really don't think a comeback is possible after the biggest fuckup of an album we've seen in a really long while. Especially when the members that made sonic syndicate what it was being gone now.
p4605
aVYeah, I really think they should just change their name, but I don't think Sjunnesson wants to do that.  I'm cautiously optimistic but even the mention of We Rule The Night makes me shudder.
p4606
aVThis song was solid imo. The vocalist has improved a lot since their early stuff, and the melodies where neat. Horrible video though, if you even can call it that.
p4607
aVActually neither of the original vocalists are still in the band, they are both in The Unguided now.\u000a\u000aAlso, I agree.  I hate lyric videos.

p4635
(lp4636
VHeartwork is a classic and is generally accepted as the first proper Melodic Death Metal album ever released. It's not quite the same as what the early Swedish bands were doing though. The Swedes were doing a lot of fast harmonized single string picking while Carcass played in a more tradition style even closer to Iron Maiden. If you like Slaughter of the Soul by At the Gates or Black Earth and Stigmata by Arch Enemy you will really dig this album.
p4637

A lot of the bands with growling/lower vocalists seem to have slower paces to their phrasings, like Insomnium or Be'lakor. \u000a
p4766
aVHmm, not quite what I desire, but thanks! It's hard to explain what I mean, and all the songs I have with those vocals, only have short parts of fast tempo vocals. I wonder if there are any bands that only has them :P Here's one more example: http://youtu.be/ddi15QlMpSY?t=1m31s (01:31-01:49)\u000a\u000aE: Dark Tranquility was the closest one for the style I'm looking for

I think this might be what you're looking for.\u000a\u000a\u000aThey're like a mix between Melodic and Thrash, worth looking into.
p4770
aVMelodeath usually has more of the slower paced vocals in general, so this is tough. Since I prefer more of the slow stuff, I couldn't find a band that does nothing but high-tempo vocals (although I have an idea of what you mean).\u000a\u000aYou already have some Persefone.\u000a\u000a[Edge of Sanity - Elegy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5QT1736y4k) might be worth looking at. Most of it is faster paced vocally (only song from them I know fits the bill).\u000a\u000aSorry I don't have much else, really.

aVInsomnium is a great band and probably the closest you'll get. Great melodic death with deep guttural growls. Also check out In Mourning, Eternal Tears of Sorrow, Omnium Gatherum, Noumena (early stuff), Dark Tranquillity, and Ghost Brigade.
p4799
aVI was going to chime in with a simple agreement and a couple recommendations of songs to listen to, but I ended up writing for over an hour. It's like picking the favorite of your own children... Sorry for the wall of text OP.\u000a\u000aDefinitely Insomnium! I'd say that 80-90% of their vocals are growls. \u000a\u000aAs far as I'm concerned, Insomnium are *the* best Melodic Death Metal band on the planet right now. I think they are really close to Be'lakor, and haven't put out a bad album yet. Even [Metal Archives reviews](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Insomnium/2332) show their lowest ranking album (all have 9 or more reviews) of all-time at 88%. The best news of all is that they have another album coming out on the 25th of April!\u000a\u000aI'll run through what I think their 3 best albums are (in chronological order). If my reviews seem to come across as negative, please note that I'm only picking out the tiny parts that I *don't* like. This is the equivalent of winning a Bugatti Veyron from a game show and bitching that there isn't chrome around the headlights. Yeah, this is really nit-picky stuff.\u000a___\u000a**One For Sorrow: (2011)** \u000a\u000aClean vocals used in unison with growls, which gives the vocals a really layered, full sound to them. I will say, however, their mastering in this album was not as impossibly perfect as it had been on previous albums. The vocals and bass are a bit muted which gives the feeling of a muddy, hollow album. They do slow to a soft whisper occasionally, which slows the mood to make it more melancholic, yet in the same song (Song of the Blackest Bird) Niilo Sevänen drops into a growl lower than he's hit in previous decade. Still this is a very, very solid album. \u000a\u000a* *Recommended songs: Song of the Blackest Bird, Every Hour Wounds, Lay the Ghost to Rest, Unsung*\u000a\u000a___\u000a**Across the Dark: (2009)** \u000a\u000aPersonally I think this is their best album. It reaches a perfect balance between excellent mastering and an appropriate clean vocals both in quality and quantity; The clean vocals are not very prevalent, and when they are used they don't take you out of the mood. The guitar mastery is excellent on this album, just like on every other one of theirs, which is needed to excel in this genre. The drums are very clear and don't steal the show. \u000a\u000a* *Recommended Songs: Weighted Down with Sorrow, Into the Woods, Down With the Sun*\u000a\u000a___\u000a**Above the Weeping World: (2006)** \u000a\u000aThe use of clean vocals in this album kind of turn me off, as they come at you in the form of a weak, croaky technique that I really don't care for. \u000a\u000a* *Recommended Songs: Mortal Share, The Killjoy*\u000a\u000a___\u000aBonus! \u000a\u000a\u000a**Since the Day It All Came Down: (2004)** \u000a\u000aWhile it's not in my top 3, I forgot that a couple of their best individual songs come from this album. \u000a\u000a* *Recommended Songs: The Day It All Came Down, Daughter of the Moon, Death Walked the Earth*

p4804
aVAs much as I love both Scar Symmetry and Solution .45, neither have "little to no clean vocals" as the OP has requested.  About the only song by either band with little to no clean vocals is "Pitch Black Progress" off the album of the same name.  I guess "Calculate the Apocalypse" is also fairly void of clean vocals.

sVJari writes about album releases and Nuclear Blast slowing down Wintersun
p4846
(lp4847
VI'm going to get crucified for saying this but here it goes: Winter Sun/Jari dropped the ball on the last album and Nuclear Blast couldn't save it.\u000a\u000aI know, that is an insanely unpopular opinion among fans, lets just call me a penguin.\u000a\u000aIt would be easier to make that assertion had I not been the most die hard fan that ever was (ok, slight exaggeration but not that much) and it took a month or more to admit it to myself- "Time I just isn't a great album".\u000a\u000aPut the pitchforks down, I'll explain how I came to this conclusion and like anything else, this is totally subjective. "Wintersun" was a fucking mind blowing album, nay- *Experience*. It changed music for me in a fundamental way. I was no longer willing to accept blast beats and fast guitars in any form, Jari had exposed me to actual skilled musicianship, there was no turning back.\u000a\u000aFast forward almost a decade. Other bands have come and gone, tastes have become more sophisticated. "Time I" is coming up for release and everyone I know is getting excited for it. The launch day hits and we're all so goddamn ready for a sonic assault its starting to cause palpitations.\u000a\u000aI remember my very first impression- "Ok, long intro, he gets to do that, this album deserves it." My second impression was- "Hmmm, that lick sounds familiar, so does that one." after 9 minutes I was thoroughly underwhelmed, this was a rehash of the same material! It wasn't "similar sounding" like any good band will pull off, it was whole licks stolen from the previous album! I was furious.\u000a\u000aOk, ok, if the album had been released in 2007 when it should have been it wouldn't have been a big deal but it had been 10 years! You gotta pull out some new tricks or scrap it and start again (I'm aware that had already happened but it happened in 2005 not 2011).\u000a\u000a"Time I" wasn't just a disappointment, it hurt my feelings. Everything that made Wintersun great had been stripped away and we were left with an opera of the first album, slightly toned down and longer.\u000a\u000aI understand if I'm the only one in this sub that felt this way, there was even disagreement between my musical peer group about it. We were essentially split down the middle and a few drunken debates became borderline violent.\u000a\u000aI didn't mean to offend anyone's music taste with this post, it was mostly to get my own frustration out. The feeling I am left with is similar to waiting for X-mas for 10 years and when it finally comes it turns out my gifts were just my own old toys wrapped in new paper.
p4848
aVI'm mostly into the first album, too.. but if Time II was to be funded by the fans I (and most sane people) would think it's wrong that Nuclear Blast takes most of the money. ¨\u000a\u000aThe point is that most record labels are shit, they abuse their power as much as they possibly can. 
p4849
aVI totally agree that labels eat up all the profit and then complain they lost money and I don't think he should work with NB anymore.\u000a\u000aI don't disagree with Jari's position on the label making things more difficult, but I don't think they wrote the tunes and that ultimately was the cause of this album's lackluster performance.\u000a\u000aShit, it didn't do well in Finland, that had to be a rough blow to his ego.
p4850
aVI prefer the first album too, but I still loved Time I. I, however, do not feel right about judging it before I have heard both parts, as it is/was supposed to be a whole album.
p4851
aV[deleted]
p4852
aVI think that is a very reasonable argument/opinion. I personally thought Time I was mind blowing but maybe that was a part of me hoping it would be since it took him almost a decade to get it to us.

VI saw this was posted 2 weeks ago, but that link seems to be dead.\u000a\u000aI have a hard time picking a favorite from their new album, but this song is a strong contender. This song has a special place in my heart after watching Cosmos. More people need to hear this masterpiece! 
p4880
aVI think this song is one of if not the best from the new album. Collapsing Words is also really good in my opinion though, dat chorus!

p4897
(lp4898
VVery nice. Not completely sold on the power metal voice, but the guitars had a nice sound and the melodies and rythm where solid. Could see myself listening to this.
p4899
aVYeah, the clean vocals are a new addition to this band's music. For example: [Hate Injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kgPyofPzfY) released in 2011 features no clean vocals, and i think neither did their 2012 release "Black Mirror's Reflection", which is a great album. They started clean vocals in their 2013 EP "The Second Reflection". I hope their presence is less, but i don't think so that'll be the case. Another one of my favorite bands that has chosen to change their sound by incorporating clean vocals, other being Darkest Hour on their newest album.

asVIn Flames - Embody the invisible
p4902
(lp4903
VSome great riffs. I love this album so much. The last incredible In Flames album, but I never get tired of it.
p4904
aVI really like this album also, one of my favorite In Flames albums. But I usually count Clayman as the last incredible IF.
p4905
aVI don't know about Clayman. It's good, but it was definitely the start of their decline. There are lots of moments on that album that I just go "What? Why?", but Colony is awesome through and through. Also, Clayman was the first album that I really hated Anders' vocals.
p4906
aVI like Clayman, but I feel the same way. A lot of tracks that probably shouldn't be there. I honestly feel that Come Clarity is stronger than Clayman, but obviously weaker than everything else they did prior to that point.\u000a\u000aI will stand out and say that Colony is my favorite In Flames album. I think it's better than TJR or Whoracle.
p4907
aVI've enjoyed most of their albums since personally.
p4908
aVI enjoy a lot of In Flames (including their latest album), but it's a different type of enjoyment. Old In Flames is more or less "classic" territory for me. If something off those albums comes on, I'll almost always listen to it. On the other hand, I have to be in the mood for anything else from them.\u000a\u000aedit: I'll say this, though -- they're fucking awesome live. They haven't lost it at all there.
