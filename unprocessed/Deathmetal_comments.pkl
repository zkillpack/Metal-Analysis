p56
(lp57
VShit yeah! Amazing album. Too bad they havent done anything since Icons of Evil. I would like to see just a little variety in the live sets. Oh well. Hammer down the nails!!! 
p58
aVI am quite sad that the album that was scheduled for release end of 2013 didn't make it, I can just hope that they'll release it in 2015.\u000a\u000aRegarding that new album, Lazaro said it'd be very much the Vital Remains we're used to, just that the songs would be shorter but that there would be more songs all in all.
p59
aVGreatest album ever made!

aVOldie but goldie!
p61
aVHAMMER DOWN THE\u000a\u000aNAILS
p62
aVLove these guys. Fantastic live! With or without Glen Benton. Saw them with Tim Yeung when this album was their latest. Food fight after show. Vital Remains can't play their anymore. 
p63
aVI gotta say the riffage is drawn out, but it makes the epic leads that more awesome. It's like you earn the massive climax after 4 minutes of decent typical death metal riffs. Best songs... \u000a1, Dechristianize \u000a2, Savor to None Failure for All \u000a3, Rush of Deliverance 
p64
asVAnyone have any good death metal that heavily uses, or, better yet, primarily uses clean vocals?
p65
(lp66
VAkercocke? 
p67
aVYa know, I somehow haven't got around to listening to them despite hearing about 'em a lot. Anywhere you recommend starting in particular? 
p68
aVMy favorite was their earlier stuff. It's all fairly solid though, think a ballsier Opeth with significantly better transitions. Eh. Start with Words that Go Unspoken.... 
p69
aVI liked it. I'll have to give them some more listens later. Also, any idea why this post was downvoted to all shit? I'm kind of at a loss- this sub already has almost nothing going on discussion wise, so I thought I'd throw something in that's relevant to me, and it's getting buried...
p70
aVBecause /r/deathmetal tends to be bizarrely elitist despite upvoting the hell out of whatever gateway shit you post.
p71
aVSigh. I really want this sub to be good, I do, but I just keep getting driven away by the fact that 90% of all posts are the same bands, the discussion threads are infrequent and boring, and half the people here don't even seem to know what death metal IS. 
p72
aVYeah, it's pretty shitty. I expected at least a better selection than /r/metal, but nope.
p73
aVWell, if you want more, feel free to go through my post history- I've posted some super-obscure death metal to here and /r/metal in the past that you may well like, and I guarantee that unless you clicked my posts when I made them, there's got to be at least one or two you haven't heard before. 
p74
aVStarting with it now.
p75
aVCynic, some obscura, vorpal implant and augury
p76
aVAugury is great. I recommend that one as well!
p77
aVI listen to all of those fairly often except for Vorpal Impant. I'll be sure to check them out, thanks. 
p78
aVVorpal implant is a one man band. It's pretty unique stuff! Unlike anything I've ever heard. Lots of stuff going on in the songs. I love the album though. It gets better with every listen.
p79
aVI wonder why the Metal Archives and Last FM don't have Vorpal...weird. 
p80
aVIt's a relatively new band. The album is up on band camp and physical copies are coming soon I think. There are some songs up on YouTube!

p164
asVNew to death metal
p165
(lp166
VKeep on keeping on with Death. That's been my favorite metal band for like 3 years now. I genuinely like every song they've ever put out. Other than that, early Suffocation. Also Morbid Angel is a must. Pestilence. Deicide. Necrophagist. Dying Fetus.  \u000a\u000aKinda wanna be more specific actually. My favorite albums:  Suffocation: Effigy. Also pierced from within. Morbid angel: Covenant. And altars of madness. Pestilence: consuming impulse. And testimony of the ancients. Mostly consuming though. Deicide: self titled. Necrophagist: both albums are amazing. Dying fetus: reign supreme.   
p167
aVThe first album to really get me into death metal was Morbid Angel - Gateways to Annihilation, but really any of their earlier work is great as well. Also, Dying Fetus - Destroy the Opposition is another personal favorite. 
p168
aVHelp to self help: \u000a\u000aGo [here](http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Goat_Zombie/top_250_death_metal_albums_of_all_time/) and go through the albums one by one via youtube. Soon you'll begin to understand which types of metal you are into, and once you find something you think sounds interesting, simply use YouTubes related links to click further into the (somewhat) same genre. \u000a\u000aI have been listening to metal for a long time, and I still do this on occasion. YouTube has become my best ally in exploring new bands. Even the cancerous comments will sometimes hold recommendations to similar bands. \u000a\u000aIt takes time figuring what you like, so be patient, and keep listening. Ask yourself what you like about Death, and what you don't like about other things. If you, as you said, just started out with death metal, venturing into too many genres simultaneously can seem confusing. It takes time to get into new genres, in a very literal way.\u000a\u000aP.s. Death is such a good place to start, so you are well on your journey already.
p169
aVJust listened to all of those bands. I guess it's just me but I don't really like them that much. I guess Death is really the only death metal band I like. Thanks anyways!
p170
aVThere is a lot more to death metal than what they suggested. There are several bands similar to death and sub grenades of death metal that don't even sound like death. I enjoyed death for a long time before finding other death metal I enjoyed. 
p171
aVSub grenades
p172
aVTry Cannibal Corpse, Phycroptic, immolation, Amon Amarth, Dethklok, Sinister, Suffocation, those are some of my favorites that I can think of, and also If you like high and low vocals, The Black Dahlia Murder is one of my favorites. their song On Stirring Seas of Salted Blood is badass. \u000aI hope you find more death metal that you like man, It's an amazing genre that hopefully never dies!\u000a\u000aEDIT: Didn't realize suffocation was already mentioned.
p173
aVcheck out cattle decapitation, decrepit birth, cephalic carnage.
p174
aVCheck out Seven Churches by Possessed, as well as other death/thrash bands. 
p175
aVStick with death and then you can start listening to Obituary, Morbid Angel, Bolt Thrower etc
p176
aVSuffocation is good. Listen to these albums by them Pinnacle of Bedlam Pierced from Within Blood Oath and self titled Suffocation. Bolt Thrower is good. All there lyrics are about war. Entombed is good. Left Hand Path is really good by Entombed. Nile is respected but I am not a big fan of Nile. Amon Amarth is good but there more melodic death or folk metal. Check out the youtube Infidelamsterdam. Hes a legend. He works with small time Death Metal Artist and big ones to. Hes really cool and his videos are awesome. He will show quite a few death metal artists. He will also show other things. Also Count Blagoroth is good. Last Fm is a good site to find new bands of any genre. Spotify is good for exploring music.  Be open. A lot of death metal is pure shit. You have to dig a little to find the good stuff. And if you dont like it hey thats o.k too. If you need anything else comment or P.M me. I'm always willing to help a fellow metalhead find good music. Good luck on your searches.

aVThose lyrics though... They really shouldn't publish those. Incomprehensible growls fit the music, but knowing it's just a string of 3-word cliches makes me unable to listen anymore. 
p211
aVSo much of death metal lyrics are like this though. Deathcore is the worst offender by far IMO. \u000a\u000aThe music is pretty slammin though, which is why I personally dig death metal, not necessarily for the deep, insightful meaning in the lyrics. \u000a\u000aPlus, the vocalist is the guitarist, which always makes me have a little more respect for a band. When it's just a vocalist doing bad lyrics? I tend to cut the band a little bit less slack

V["Metal in Inappropriate Places"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v41N5KwJc84) has no lyrics, isn't really a band and, well, it's a joke, but it's pretty mundane! \u000a\u000aBut yeah, now I am wondering if a band would be able to do something like you described _without_ being humorous. Because death metal pretty much revolves around an "epic" quality, and if you try "Epic Doing the Dishes" it becomes an instant parody. It's also aggressive, and if you add aggressiveness to daily routine the lyrics will probably sound too silly or pretentious, and involuntarily funny.

aVI don't know what you mean by "hyper-processed wankfest" their guitarist uses fast sweep picking to make those "alien" sounds if that's what you think is "processed" But  a lot of people that I show this band to don't like it. I guess it's not for everyone
p315
aVBy hyper-processed, I mean brickwalled production with zero dynamics in sound, and by wankfest, I mean it's noodlely, go-nowhere bullshit. It's glorified scale exercises. Hence, wankfest: Musical masturbation.

aVI had it pegged for best of the year before it even came out,  and pre-ordered it. And I think I'm the only person in the world who was underwhelmed by it. \u000a\u000aI really like their other releases, but this one just feels very... well,  actually it doesn't make me feel anything. Which is the problem. I keep spinning it, and keep thinking nothing in particular about it, good or bad. It's just on. 
p360
aVI gave it a few spins already and it's a really solid album. I like it, but I can see where you're coming from. I had to listen to it a couple of times to appreciate it because, at the beginning, it just sounded like, well, a death metal album, and usually I like to keep listen some different elements to really grasp my attention, which is why my list is conformed by a lot of Blackened Death Metal.

aV[deleted]
p385
aVThese are great suggestions as far as production goes. Solarflesh is one of the highest quality albums I've heard in a while.
p386
aVDefinitely need to check out [Abysmal Dawn](http://youtu.be/wedhP9yTjdk). One of my personal favorite straight up DM bands. Also try [Behemoth](http://youtu.be/YqnEBRZ6jS8), [Cattle Decapitation](http://youtu.be/szOlMfoN-jU), and [Dying Fetus](http://youtu.be/ttEQ-APseaQ) to name a few. You'll definitely need to open up to more of a raw sound to enjoy much of DM, such as this [GOLD](http://youtu.be/d1Z8OQSu11Q)
p387
aVMy personal suggestions, having come from deathcore into death metal a few years ago are mostly comprised of Brutal or Slamming Death Metal. Slams are more elaborate than breakdowns and piqued my interest early on. \u000a\u000aTry these:\u000a\u000aNote: Not all of these bands are slam and in fact most aren't. These are just bands that I'd recommend if you said "turn me".\u000a\u000a[The Faceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w6AnNiNiEY) You like deathcore? You'll love The Faceless.\u000a\u000a[Abominable Putridity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWKLN6boesU) Slammy Goodness.\u000a\u000a[Vomit the Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2SVhlZfuUU) Bass Drop. I think you'll like this.\u000a\u000a[Extermination Dismemberment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvSTYZ0P-rY) In case you were wondering if there were more bass drops in death metal.\u000a\u000a[Beyond Creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BluvF_ozYJs) Highly recommended for any death metal first time listener.\u000a\u000a[Archspire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7CcJ-QuTd4) These guys deserve a medal.\u000a\u000aI can think of a lot more but let me know what you think so far.\u000a\u000aEdit: I'm usually in r/technicaldeathmetal if you couldn't tell.  
p388
aVSounds like you might like [Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijofPDI-ygw) \u000a\u000a[Dyscarnate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR_pr2zmW_Y) is very clean and heavy as hell\u000a\u000a
p389
aVI like deathcore - it was one of the genres that bridged the way over to death metal for me. It seems you're into proggier stuff (as am I), but I don't think tech death is the best sort of introduction to death metal. [Bloodbath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiONOj4nAqY), [Aeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7eq6KiOYEM) and [The Resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02x7oMAon8) are a few good bets for you imo.
p390
aVBloodbath - Eaten, one of my favourite tracks ever. 
p391
aVThe Black Dahlia Murder is usually popular among deathcore fans. Alterbeast is a band that's a lot like TBDM if they were more technical. If you like either of those then the next step is At the Gates.

Just listen to one song all the way through and try and keep up. Insanely fast and they build up to some devastating breakdowns with sweeps and all kinds of crazy stuff. Theyre seriously amazing.\u000a http://youtu.be/GDelJ_q9F8M\u000a\u000a\u000aLike everyone else is saying. Behemoth's evangelion \u000aIs an album with some of the best mixing.

I hope they do, it's a great album. They know how to write [great death metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgLsPWAgd8A). Is that a slam at the end? A breakdown slows down the pace of the song but in that one they actually *up* it

aVGood post; I definitely like it as well, having just discovered them the other day on their label's website.  It's a bit of fresh air relative to the generic, stagnant stuff in the scene lately.

I just looking around and looking at the crowd, then all of a sudden he is walking out and toward me direction. My fucking eyes grew big as shit, i was fucking star strucked, he noticed it and the look on his face was almost like ''...fuck...'' lol but pretty damn chill  he gestures his hand out to acknowledge my fandom and said " whats up man"  I shook his hand and said " you are a cool ass dude" and he thanked me and kept it moving.

asVHuman or Symbolic?
p499
(lp500

p501
aVClose To The Edge is probably the best album ever written by human beings.
p502
aVGotta go *Symbolic*. For Crystal Mountain alone.
p503
aVThis ^
p504
aVHuman.  It's got DiGiorgio, Reinert, and Masvidal... and it doesn't get any better than that.
p505

p506
aVHuman for Lack of Comprehension.
p507
aVLeprosy, obviously. Those two aren't even in my top three. 
p508
aVi'm with this guy. 1. Leprosy 2. Spiritual Healing 3. Scream Bloody Gore. then their later albums.
p509
aVSame here except Human instead of Scream Bloody Gore
p510
aVScream bloody gore you nerds
p511
aVSymbolic. And that's coming from me.
p512
aVOf those two.. Symbolic. But Leprosy is my favorite overall. 
p513
aVSymbolic for me. 
p514
aVSymbolic... You never really get bored of the album as you'd do with others maybe. All the songs are amazing, especially for the fact that that whole album has a lot of nostalgic value to me.
p515
aVCancer and AIDS.

p538
(lp539
VBloodbath taking the best of death metal and combining it. Honestly love every one of their albums with the difference in style and presentation. Not completely sold on old Nick, but I have faith that they'll pull it off with the upcoming album as well.
p540
aVPeter Tägtgren owns! I love his vocals; so dirty, gruff and evil! \u000a\u000aNightmares Made Flesh along with Unblessing the Purity are my favorite albums (by Bloodbath).\u000a\u000aOne really consistently awesome thing throughout Bloodbath's works would definitely be the drumming. Especially on the two albums I mentioned. It's inspirational!
p541
aVPeter's vocals on this album, particularly Eaten, are directly responsible for me being where I am today. I still remember when this album came out, I was a sophomore in college and picked up the CD as soon as the record shop near school got it in. I listened to it all day, and that night was leaving a party drunk as fuck and we cranked it up in the car. I had never tried guttural vocals before but Eaten got me so pumped up in one drunken moment that I just belted the words out and surprised the shit out of myself. Next band practice I tried it out, and boom...I took over vocal duties. Been lead singing and playing in bands ever since, Europe tour next year. Bloodbath will always have my respek'
p542
aVYou mean there isn't particularly a trick to it? God damn have I been overthinking it?
p543
aVNo "tricks" that I've found...don't get me wrong, I'm 1000x better today than I was back then, there is a LOT of technique involved, but no the basic function of guttural vocals is just give it all you've got from as low a place in your gut as you can muster. Your whole core should be involved, power comes from your abs and lats I've found. The throat is used for shaping and the mouth for annunciation only. \u000a\u000aI'm no professional voice coach and everything I say comes with the "I can't guarantee you're not going to injure yourself" disclaimer, but it's one thing I can say without tempering with humility that I have some expertise in. So lemme know if you're having issues
p544
aVThanks dude, I will! I've always been confused about the whole "from the gut" thing. What does that mean, what does it feel like?
p545
aVYou know when you're dry heaving over a toilet bowl after a wicked puke sesh, you've got nothing left to give but your body keeps trying to wrench more out of you? Try to recall those muscles that are involuntarily contracted in your abdomen that "force" you to puke...your abs and obliques primarily. That's where your power should come from. \u000a\u000aSo stand up tall, open up your chest and posture, take a few HUGE breaths to expand your lungs, then on the last one use those muscles to expel the air out of your lungs like you're trying to blow the pigs' house down. Of course your diaphragm is naturally going to do a lot of the direct heavy lifting but contracting those core muscles keeps your core tension up and thus a firmer platform to push against. It'll all make sense once you feel it. \u000a\u000aOnce you've done that a little bit, then just use your throat to "throttle" the air coming out, and fuckin growl!! This is where your own unique style and sound comes through, so I won't go too deep into that. Just get to a place where others can't hear you and you're not embarrassed to be loud as fuck while you're figuring it all out, and experiment. Go hard, exhaust yourself. And when you think you've had enough and can't get any lower, get mad, sack the fuck up and dig deeper. \u000a\u000aThe one thing I hate to see is dudes that drop their jaw to get this artificially low sound. You've probably seen them, bedroom rockstars on their PC microphones doing vocal covers. They're quiet, sound like shit, and look like they're about to fellate the mic. The depth of your voice comes from resonance in your body cavity as I explained above, not from the little bit of space in your mouth. Or even worse...people that cup the mic. It's fake, it sounds like shit, and you look stupid. Do you think Glen Benton or Peter Tagtgren ever cupped a mic? If you do it right, you will be LOUD and sound BRUTAL without the busch league tricks guys use that don't know what they're doing. Sound guys and recording engineers will love you. Not to mention the crowd.\u000a\u000aYour mouth is for articulation. That's why guys that do the jaw-drop/mic cupping have no chops and sound like "bwahbwhabwahbwah reeeeeeee"...because their mouth is employed doing stupid shit rather than being free to punctuate and annunciate. Once you've gotten the hang of your overall sound from your throat, lungs and core, then you can use your mouth as you do every day to achieve whatever level of articulation you're going for. \u000a\u000aEdit: added some stuff. if you want clarification on anything let me know
p546
aVWhat's the name of your band?
p547
aVBloodbath is one of my favorite DM bands. They really have their own sound and accomplish being "catchy" while still maintaining a 100% evil death metal sound. I can't handle it. \u000a\u000aNew album in 3 ish weeks!

aVOn top of all mentioned, Death!\u000a\u000aDeath is the best death metal band there and a pioneer!\u000aIt has been evolving throughout its existence and it has SOME OF THE BEST LYRICS IN METAL.\u000a\u000aIts a must!
p676
aVDeath is very very good. Im glad my Dad showed them to me.
p677
aVScream Bloody Gore is the only worthy album, though.
p678
aVNot true. Every album is a masterpiece in its own style.
p679
aVAs a fellow black metal enthusiast who has recently gotten into death metal, my favorites are Grave Miasma, Vanhelgd and Desolate Shrine.
p680
aVThank you so much.

aVCattle Decapitation http://youtu.be/ttv7MosT49U Easily one of my favorite vocalist in death metal. Structure of their songs are excellent as well. Yay opinions! Hope you enjoy it. 
p682
aVbut wouldnt you say they are more grind than dm? 
p683
aVif youre looking from grindy death metal totally listen to REPULSION 
p684
aVI wouldn't but some might. I haven't listened to much grind but what I have heard has mostly consisted of really short songs with very little structure as far as chorus and stuff. Cattle,for the most part, is the opposite of this. 
p685
aVAzarath. Start with the album Blasphemer's Malediction. Thank me later.
p686
aVhow about black death? what kinda bm do you like? depends on your taste i guess but maybe check out sarcofago, blasphemy, anal vomit, early beherit, blasphemophagher, black witchery, diocletian, damaar, imprecation, bestial warlust, FUCKING mystifier. check out dark descent records. they have a ton black death that i think black metal fans would be into. 
p687
aVI listened to Belphegor's newest album last nine. It was recommended by Infidelamsterdam. Thoroughly enjoyable. I will have to check out the black death scene. I'll look at dark descent records today. Thanks for your help and recommendations.
p688
aVI really struggled to get into DM as well for similar reasons, and even today I like DM but not as much as I like other genres because of the same general stagnation - I'm not saying ALL bands do it, there's a few good ones out there still that are doing new cool things. Having said that what really *really* helped me get into DM was reading two books whilst listening to the songs and albums they talked about. My two books are [Choosing Death](http://www.choosingdeath.com/) and [Swedish Death Metal](http://www.bazillionpoints.com/shop/decibels-2008-book-of-the-year/). Both excellent books - I thoroughly enjoyed them and would recommend them as entry-point to anyone.\u000a\u000aThat aside, I also love DEATH. I find their albums very different and with more to say beyond the usual gratuitous-gorefest. I also really enjoy Cannibal Corpse, to me they're like the AC/DC of DM in the sense that you *know* what you're gona get when you pick up a CC album... they don't fuck around.\u000a\u000aIf you're still down for some more reading I also recommend you get [Mean Deviation](http://www.bazillionpoints.com/shop/progmetal/) - also killer book and written by Jeff Wagner of Broken Hope. Not just 'prog' it opened my ears to a lot of awesome DM as well for sure.
p689
aVAwesome. I love reading. Il check them out. Thanks so much.
p690
aVyou're welcome - enjoy the reading! have you checked [Dayal Paterson's BM book](http://feralhouse.com/black-metal/)? it's also pretty good, and his second book of interviews is great as well. 
p691
aVExtremity Retained by Jason Netherton is worth reading. 
p692
aVHey nice. Thanks so much.
p693
aVDisincarnate-Dreams of the carrion kind.    Edge of sanity-Purgatory afterglow
p694
aVMy favorite death metal band is a relatively new group from Germany called Deserted Fear.  They play old school style death that's reminiscent of Death or Obituary while having a really rich and deep sound that draws me into their music.\u000a\u000a[Call Me Your God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2_YNVV4IzE)\u000a\u000aAlso Revocation.  You can't go wrong with a little [Revocation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdMvNiyq8Hs)
p695
aVI don't know how much grind you like in your death, or how lefty you like your lyrics, but two bands that have done their homework quite nicely are Napalm Death and Carcass. \u000a\u000aThis being /r/Deathmetal and all, I'll recommend any Napalm Death release after the EP Mentally Murdered is pretty damn good deathgrind. Starting in Fear, Emptiness, Despair on through to Words from the Exit Wound they play a lot with death metal and a bit of groove metal and grindcore here and there. From Enemy of the Music Business and Order of the Leech onwards they return to a very, VERY nice form of deathgrind. Hell, some of the songs are geniuenly catchy in that hardcore-ish kinda way.\u000aLyric-wise, they tend towards the left of the political spectrum, from anarchism, socialism, social critique (particularly of capitalism), feminism, the whole gamut. Kinda like all those annoying lefties you meet at college, minus the annoying.\u000a\u000aNow, as for Carcass, Heartwork and Swansong are where it's at. Their lyrics are about social critiques and feelings. They're on the more brutal sides of melodic death metal (Heartwork) and death n roll (Swansong). \u000a\u000aNow, if you like your death metal Florida style and have non-standard lyrics it'd be pretty much mandatory to listen to Death from Leprosy onwards and World Downfall by Obituary. Death focused on a host of issues, from the personal (Bite the Pain) to the public (Suicide Machine) to relationships between folks (Low Life). Obituary meanwhile tackle environmental issues, like folks not giving one about pollution from the point of view of the polluter (Don't Care) to denial of real problems (Solid State). \u000a\u000aAh, but you're quite the amateur philosopher. If you like what the Frenchies have done in the past 50 years (nigh indecipherable explanations of society) then I encourage Cynic. I suggest you get ask what the lyrics mean cause I haven't a clue (something about the Cynics I guess?). Music-wise, they're awesome. Period. Or at least awesome in Focus, Traced in Air, and Re-Traced (I've yet to listen to more recent material).  Their material is kinda reminiscent of those 70's progressive rock bands like Pink Floyd and Yes. It's very nice all around. Lots of different moods and and proggy parts without making 10 minute wank fests.\u000a\u000aFinally, merging social critique, tree hugging (the kind we should all honestly get behind) and a bit of philosophy here and there is Atheist. The jazz fusion influence is not lost on anyone who gives it a chance. Think if Miles Davis toned down the song lengths and made an album with Evil Chuck. Yeah, I think that that describes Atheist nicely. Needless to say, Unquestionable Presence is the album of choice, though mind you, I've yet to listen to their more recent output.
p696
aVThank you. I never really known there was some death metal bands that hit so close to home with there lyrics. I like Death a lot. Pull The Plug being one of my favs. But i'm new to them. I tried Carcass. There new album I was iffy on. Very talented musicians. I just didn't feel the lyrics really went anywhere. But nevertheless. I am always willing to retry a band. I will check out the Carcass albums you mentioned. I've never even heard of Cynic. So thanks for that. I also had no idea Atheist was proggy. So nice. Thanks so much.

Then one day I get this itch for something to obliterate me. And thats when my metal love comes back full strong. Metals fun.

VFuck what anyone has to say these guys have come along way from the time I first heard them when Ruination came out, and an even longer way from Doom and their deathcore years. I hope all their songs on the new album are this good and better. Damn seems like everybody is stepping up their music game with trying to be proggy and technical though haha, which definitely isn't a bad thing.
p775
aVYeah pretty much! I love that technical vibe they've got going now! 
p776
aVI really don't get the hate Deathcore bands (or -core bands in general) get in all these subreddits. The metal community is so ridiculously elitist, it's damn near embarassing to be part of it. Music is still music, no matter if you like it or not. There's no reason to run around and put other people's work down just because you're a sour and sad excuse for a human being. Live and let live I suppose.\u000a\u000aAlso, cool song. I haven't listened to JFaC since Doom, but it's cool to hear how they've changed.
p777
aVFor longtime fans of Death Metal, Deathcore represented a severe dumbing down of the genre. Death Metal was always the genre that was the most technical but also often very experimental. In about 2005-2006, I remember all the Deathcore bands hitting and it felt like they were just cookie cutter copies of the easiest to play Cannibal Corpse riffs. Over and over and over. It even seemed like the logos turned into the same font: that I-just-scrawled-our-name-on-a-wall font. I dunno, it was just disheartening. It was like watching a great TV show for 5 seasons and then the 6th is just full of clip shows of the highlights of the last 5 seasons, and you're sitting there going, "Wait, I wanted to see what happened next!"\u000a\u000aAnd it wasn't just about ignoring it and letting the fans have their new genre, because it became ubiquitous. A lot of big death metal acts started touring with bands like Whitechapel or JFAC or Suicide Silence. It was inescapable, so of course people complained. 
p778
aVI Hated JFAC at first, many years ago. Once i finally came around they had already released Gloom, but i really liked the direction they went in. I like the old stuff now just as much as the new stuff. This sounds killer

aVSweet, I love shitty bottom-of-the-barrel death metal from a deathcore band that jumped ship
p783
aVWho gives a shit about being nitpicky about genre? That's some straight hipster shit right there. If you claim to like death metal, or deathcore, or just metal in general and don't like Job For a Cowboy, something is wrong with your fucking ears.\u000a\u000aDoom fucking ruled. Genesis fucking ruled. Ruination was a bit different, but so what, it still fucking ruled. Demonocracy was again a bit different, but what band doesn't evolve their sound over time? It still fucking ruled. And this album will fucking rule. \u000a\u000aIf you want to talk about a band that jumped ship and completely changed their sound go whine about Slipknot or some bullshit, JfaC is still metal as fuck even if they don't make the **exact** same type of music as their first album.
p784
aVYah Slipknot turned to complete shit, and im pretty sure it was corey's doing. Trying to make it more like stone sour i guess.
p785
aVSomething must be wrong with my ears then, because JFaC is garbage. All iterations. Deathcore in general is garbage.
p786
aVDude, screw this JFaC circle jerk, I'm right with you.

VIn comparison to this 10 years ago:\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/5I2nOgheppw\u000a\u000a\u000aI understand the line up changes but on Watershed they had the same crew and it was awesome then.  The sound now is a bit thin and lacking the punch and intensity it had that made it tolerable to listen to the drawn out emo bits.  Fuck, Akerfeldt is only like 42...  I'm pretty sure Jens Kidman is around 45 and his vocals are still insane.  Smoking??  I also listened to the single from the upcoming record and wasn't really digging it... The Heritage album had some great moments so I accept the change in their writing but I'm thinking they're almost done...  Thoughts?
p814
aVDont forget. Meshuggah are alien mathematicians sent from the future, so im sure that helps Jens.
p815
aVAlthough I see where you're coming from, I doubt they will be over soon. I saw them not long ago and they kicked ass (without a single growl) which makes me think that maybe this was a bad day for them or something. \u000a\u000aAkerfeldt is a music nut as well as a great performer and I don't think he wants to stop- just move in *another* new direction. Keep in mind that Heritage/ Pale Communion (and possibly Damnation) aren't the first examples of a shift in the band's sound, compare "Blackwater Park" to "My Arms, Your Hearse" or "Still Life". Part of why I love this band is because they aren't afraid to mix things up and experiment.
p816
aVI don't understand all the complaining surrounding Opeth.  They've been together for almost 25 years.  If they kept making the same melodic death metal over and over again they would just suck now like In Flames.  Plus when you're in a band that big you don't have a lot of time for side projects, and playing the same shit forever sucks.
p817
aVIt's not really a complaint, just a thread started to discuss what they've been up to and regarding their new material.  I still love the band but sometimes I'm wondering if a band goes thru so many line up changes and then changes their sound why don't they just move on to a whole different project?  Just like Mastodon, they are awesome, have tons of material but aren't really hitting it like they did back in the early 2000's...
p818
aVI like how Cannibal Corpse does Pop and Dubstep now, they keep it fresh.
p819
aVHe's doing it on purpose so people will stop bugging him about death vocals.  
p820
aVI really think Mikey was just tired of doing death metal all around, so did another album with *gasp* no growls?!  There has been talk of them doing more death metal, but right now I think they're happy being a prog band. \u000a\u000aI dont like their newer stuff either. Im currently listening to Damnation,  this is my favorite of their slower material.
p821
aVSomeone once told me to check out Opeth and I did and I didn't like their music.\u000a\u000aThis reminded me of that time.

Bloodbath was one of the few bands that felt like they had a really good progression going for them, no matter what kind of line-up changes happened. I felt the same way about Nightmares Made Flesh when it first came out and now it's one of my personal favorites. I'm hoping that I will feel the same way after this record drops, but I can't help but think that his vocals are more aligned with Black/Doom and not so much Old School Swedish Death Metal.\u000a\u000a*Edit : Added link to "Breeding Death" from the Wacken Carnage DVD.\u000a

(lp842
VYou lost me and 99% of all death metal at 'comprehensible lyrics'
p843
aVI mean, there's a difference between Wormed and like, Suffocation. I can't understand Wormed very well but you better believe that I can understand Suffocation, Necrophagist, Cannibal Corpse, etc. 
p844
aVI see what you mean. I'm the kinda person who can barely understand most normal pop singing, I guess I just have bad ears. It's still a tricky question cuz when you say 'gutteral grotesque' I think of bands like Wormed or Defeated Sanity.\u000a\u000aCheck out [Human Remains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv6XHdtf9vg)
p845
aVIt's all about making a long-term effort to get it. My dad raised me on metal with distorted vocals and we'd sit in the car on long road trips trying to figure out the lyrics to metal bands playing on the couple of Sirius Radio stations that used to exist (though IIRC there's only one now- I don't have it in my car, so I don't know for sure). I'm at the point where unless the lyrics are intentionally overly distorted I can almost always get them if I focus a bit, and less distorted stuff is just like listening to any clean singing.\u000a\u000aHuman Remains is pretty cool sounding- kind of a groovy OSDM vibe with a hint of grind influence on it? Too bad they didn't ever do a full-length. 
p846

VYeah, r/black metal may be able to help you a bit more but here are a few that I could think of.\u000a\u000a[Hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMzxBLRy3w0) My personal favorite Blackened Death Metal Band.\u000a\u000a[Dissection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORLcFRbjet4) Their older stuff sounds a lot more evil but the Satanic messages are a constant throughout the existence of Dissection.\u000a\u000a[Watain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4GqLpI0KVc) A lot like Dissection in lyrical content but the sound should be what you're looking for.\u000a\u000aHope I could help you out a bit. I'm not too big on black metal. Be sure to check out Dissection's early stuff if you like Reinkaos.\u000a
p858
aVThanks! I really liked Hate and Dissection, well at least the stuff you linked to. And /r/blackmetal only gave me two comments haha, so you guys helped me more. \u000a\u000a
p859
aVSo glad that I could help you out. Solarflesh isn't Hate's best album but all of their work is pretty solid. Everything on Reinkaos is like music to the soul for me. \u000a\u000aThere's a death metal band that only slightly reminds me of these guys instrumentally. Not as aggressive, but you should check them out. Glad to assist you though. People have been shitting on Behemoth recently but I'm glad to see another fan out there still loving their music. \u000a\u000aHere's that band though: [Inferi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzO9-qXJrAk)

asVTrying to get a non metal head into metal.
p952
(lp953
VMelodic Death Metal is probably the best entrance to Death Metal\u000a\u000aor early Thrash metal (Slayer, Sodom, Kreator) and then then transition into early Death metal (Death, Massacre, Morbid Angel)
p954
aVI was thinking about giving him soundtrack to the apocalypse next but I didn't know if it was still too early for that
p955
aVthis is what it was for me. Amon Amarth and COB meant I was already used to the harsh vocals, and once I followed the historical path of OSDM as it evolved from Thrash riffs (which I also liked), the music began to make sense and I was hooked.
p956
aVDethklok - hear me out, the cartoon is funny as shit and the soundtrack/band is amazing. If your friend likes comedy, then you might slyly get them into metal too. 
p957
aVThese are wise words.
p958
aVI would completely agree. I've got many a friend into metal by way of Dethklok.  Its a great show,  good music and gives an idealistic perspective of the inner e'er workings of the mind of a metalheaf
p959
aVDying Fetus and the faceless both got me into deathmetal. I recommend showing him Opeth though, they have both clean and death vocals. Show him ghost of perdition :) 
p960
aVI didn't think about opeth and I have blackwater park! Thank you great recommendation.
p961
aVFind a subgenre that your buddy likes (you'll probably have to start with some more watered-down/"gateway" bands) then explore that sub together. Luckily you're going to a show and that's the best way to convert the innocent.
p962
aV[deleted]
p963
aVI took 2 non-metalheads to see Arch Enemy recently, and they both had a great time.\u000a\u000aThat said, I absolutely love metal, have been to literally hundreds of shows, and I wouldn't go to Pig Destroyer.  I'd bet they'd just confirm everything your friend doesn't like about metal and turn them against it once and for all.  Start with a band that makes an effort to be enjoyable.
p964
aVAye, Pig Destroyer isn't exactly 'easing' them into metal.
p965
aVPower metal is a gateway into metal. \u000aEarly metallica is a gateway to thrash. \u000aDeath is a gateway to well death. \u000aDissection is a gateway to black.\u000a\u000aLast but not least anal cunt is a gateway to grindcore, or permanent brain damage.
p966
aVWell, I was 12 y.o. at that time and kinda wanted to listen something brutal and extreme.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I've got my non-metal-head friends singing along to Cannibal Corpse's _Pounded into dust_. I think the key was that I presented it as something fun... when they were drunk. Also had a great success with Bloodbath's _Ways to the grave_.\u000a\u000a
p967
aVLove the topic. Second Maiden and agree with classic thrash metal. On the growl vocals side of the question, I had success with a couple of friends using "ugly" vocals as gateway: Carcass and Obituary, then At the Gates. From there, Domination from Morbid Angel should tie things together. (If he has a melancholic side, I'd throw some Paradise Lost in the mix too -- Icon is kind of a balanced moment, keep going back in time for added weight. If it works, you can throw him Anathema's Serenades and the deed is done.)\u000a\u000aYou guys should also watch together some Sam Dunn docs like Global Metal and/or the Metal Evolution series \u2014 it's a way to expose him to lots of different stuff while getting a coherent background. \u000a\u000aGood luck!\u000a
p968
aVEarly Opeth for me, particularly morningrise.
p969
aVYou could try bands like The Sword and Electic Wizard, they worked for me to convert a friend, then slowly feed them riffs from death metal tracks, some septic flesh, sabaton whatever to get them into the harsher stuff.  Also a major point to make for me when getting someon hooked is to tell them to take the vocalist as another instrument, and not worry so much about the lyrics and the clarity, comparing it to a trumpet in jazz.
p970
aVYou're skipping a lot of steps.  Maybe reiterate to your friend that "it is an art form."  And that way it might be easier to see how people develop a taste for it.  I draw the parallel with scotch whiskey.  Many people who taste scotch for the first time might be disgusted by it, but they can appreciate that it is an art.  
p971
aVAll of the suggestions on here are already pretty extreme for a non fan.  I would recommend one band to ease him into things: Epica.\u000a\u000aFirst, Simone is gorgeous so YouTube videos will have eye candy to keep his interest.\u000a\u000aSecond, they have many varied tracks so it isn't insane screaming all the time.\u000a\u000aThird, Mark Jansen growls but not all the time.  Its a great way to get your feet wet because growling isn't something non fans like at all.\u000a\u000aFourth, if he starts to like Epica you can branch off with the Epica family tree.  Kind of like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon to keep his emotional connection to the music.\u000a\u000aMark Jansen was in After Forever with Floor Jansen.  Floor had ReVamp and is in Nightwish.  But she dates the drummer of Sabaton.  \u000a\u000aSabaton is on tour with Amon Amarth.  Just following that tree gets you to the kings of Swedish Metal and a shit ton of great metal.\u000a\u000aThen, Simone has a baby with Oliver from Kamelot who had Alisa White Gluz as a back up singer and she fronts Arch Enemy now.  Kamelot also had Eliz Ryd as a singer and she is from Amaranthe and they are from Gothenburg, Sweden.  \u000a\u000aAnd now you can talk all about the Gothenburg Sound and introduce In Flames, Soilwork and Meshuggah.\u000a\u000aAnd really, once you walk them all the way through to Amon Amarth, In Flames, Soilwork and Meshuggah they should be ready for anything Pig Destroyer will throw at them.

p978
aVIron Maiden is a good gateway. Then just keep introducing heavier stuff. 
p979
aVGreat topic, but Pig Destroyer is a bit intense for a noob. always start them off with the classics (Death, Vader, Morbid Angel) and then ease into more brutal stuff like Suffocation, Decide. Some people, myself included, aren't too big into the super brutal bands, but after developing the ear for the technical stuff at that point can at least appreciate it for what it is.  
p980
aVI'd try necrophagist, they and dying fetus got me into metal 
p981
aVIf you can't acknowledge how sweet Muhammed's solos sound then there is no hope. I also transitioned using Necrophagist. 
p982
aVIt's probably too late now, but I don't think a Pig Destroyer show is going to be at all representative of what metal shows are normally like. Neither the crowd nor the band will likely give off a particularly metal-esque vibe, and the music might sound pretty much like white noise to your friend. But you do you--it could be great.\u000a\u000aIn terms of getting someone into metal (death metal or otherwise), I think there are two important things--one, you can't force anyone to like it. Two, a friend will be interested in it if you are interested in it, i.e. being just so excited about metal that you've got to show your buddy is the only way. 
p983
aVThe crowd and band at a PD show won't be particularly metal-esque?  Have you seen this band?

aVSiksa Kubur (IndonesiA) are the first to come to mind when I think 'Progressive', although still brutal. I'm not aware of any bands in the traditional Scandinavian sound to be honest.

aVMan you've gone places in this thread ;D I'm not quite sure I understand what you're looking for (and it seems neither you, but that's cool). The title mention sumerian and eastern, and then there's a lot of blackened death metal on your picks. I'm gonna throw some stuff around here, listen and see if something makes sense. \u000a\u000aI got an "epic" vibe from your examples. Take a listen to this Moonsorrow track -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcKWlb1xiBA. If it clicks, you might wanna wander into pagan/viking metal, and go deeper on blackened death. \u000a\u000aYou mentioned eastern influences. Orphaned Land mixes prog/death with Middle Eastern tones, it's impressive. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7i6UB5vGw \u000a\u000aOn a similar note, but more brutal death vein, inimitable avant-metal forefathers Lykathea Aflame also dealt with eastern vibes. Elvenefris is an album that should never be missed. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBDTc8TA-_k\u000a\u000aAlso Morbid Angel has lots of things that could be considered "worship" and "sumerian" on their discography, but it's more as a the theme than on the music itself (except the odd instrumental interlude). I think the same could be said about Nile. Since you didn't mentioned either of them on the OP, you should make investigating those your priority. :)\u000a\u000a
p1049
aVThank you so much for your reply!  Up-arrows for you, bro!\u000a\u000aMoonsorrow isn't bad at all-- I sort of liken them to a budget Amon Amarth (who have some stellar stuff, btw).  I've found Aeternam is a good bet, too.\u000a\u000aOrphaned Land is a little too far on the "prog" side of things, not quite my cup of tea, but they've got a few with some really incredible instrumental work when I looked hard enough.  \u000a\u000aI'm really, really impressed with Lykathea Aflame, man.  That's some real jammin' goodness!!!  The vocals are the kind of "deep" thing I can really dig all over.\u000a\u000aAll in all, you're a badass, and I sincerely appreciate the time you took to put this list together.  You're one cool dude!
p1050
aVHey man, my pleasure, helping folks finding good music brighten my day!\u000a\u000aThat Lykathea Aflame album is ungodly and gonna spoil you, because there's nothing quite like it.

I really wish Organic Halucinosis had that same production because there is some incredible drumming on that album but the high end is really quiet and you can't hear the intricate cymbal work.

aVI like that album a lot, but I can't help thinking about Dying Fetus while listening to it. Misery Index almost sounds like a DF cover band at certain points.
p1249
aVCome on, they have distanced themselves from DF years ago.\u000aBut Jason was a major songwriter in his days with DF so it's gonna happen
p1250
aVThe Black Dahlia Murder's Ritual, that albums production was perfect and probably one the best albums Jason Suecof has produced.
p1251
aVAND now I have Carbonized In Cruciform stuck in my head.  Thanks.\u000a\u000a
p1252
aVOh god.  No comment.
p1253
aVAnything by Colin Marston really. Labyrinth Constellation by Artificial Brain, but most importantly Colored Sands from Gorguts. Each instrument sound so unique and yet blend so well together, incredible. Also true for the last Dysrythmia, not death metal though. \u000a\u000aFor fans of very deark and pounding death metal, he also recently produced a record for [Phobocosm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY_WzsbqJ44) from Montreal.
p1254
aVFor me, there has never been a death metal album produced as well as Close to a World Below.
p1255
aVFather you're not a father...
p1256
aVMmmmmmhhhmmm! That's definitely at the top of my list as well. Can't get over those rolling, thundering, destructive drum fills. Hail Satan!
p1257
aVPsycroptic's (Ob)servant is top-tier. So so clean and pretty.\u000a\u000aAlso, Beyond Creation's latest 
p1258
aVI can't stand Observants production. The kick sounds soo bad.
p1259
aVI've never understood why people consider sterile, clean production a plus in death metal.  (Ob)servant and Omnivium both sound like plastic studio shit with no bite or feeling.
p1260
aVI obviously don't feel that way about that album, but I do feel that way about other albums.
p1261
aVThen you should probably get your ears checked.
p1262
aVSuffocation's latest album sounds really good IMO. A bit on the digital side overall but so complementary to their sound. Spawn of Possession's "Incurso," has maybe the best bass tone ever and all-around damn good production. Colored Sands took me a few listens to appreciate and is definitely up there.

aVHaha yeah I've learned to never listen to their labels. Regardless, these dudes are sicker than shit. I can see them doing big things.
p1283
aVWell they definitely are black metal. IMO it's a mix of Black/Death Metal. That's even what they describe themselves as on their facebook page.
p1284
aVThe influence is definitely there for sure. They remind me of a more death metal Vektor.

aVTheir NEW stuff is insanely popular. I want to encourage people to explore the earlier part of their discography. Sorry for not making myself clearer, I should have elaborated more.

aVSpheres of Madness IS the most popular death metal track, I'm sure. Very few come to mind that could surpass it in... Lesser knowing circles? Maybe Necrophagist songs are more popular, but Spheres of Madness is  wayyyy up there.

p1473
aVI like some Cryptopsy but not much. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWretched is fantastic! I can't believe I have never heard of them before.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI have heard of Decapitated but have never really listend to them. I will now. Same with Cattle Decapitation.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aKrisiun is hit or miss for me. I like some of their songs but the majority of their work I dislike.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDevourment is a bit too grind for me.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVital Remains. Holy shit.

p1480
aVI really like God Dethroned's Lair of the White Worm album. I haven't really listened to much beyond that.
p1481
aVSince you seem to dig the classics check out old [Deicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RJrY7ZzX_I) and [Bolt Thrower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uSM-ihNGHs). For blacked death you could do a lot worse than [Emperor IX Equilibrium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X9WGZcnO-o). 
p1482
aVThanks! I have heard of Bolt Thrower but have never listened to them before. I like what I hear! I do like Deicide already. Emperor is a bit more Black Metal than I would like but they are still pretty good.
p1483
aVI'm going to recommend Jungle Rot. They are sort of "meat and potatoes" death metal and remind me of Bolt Thrower, but they do what they do damn well.\u000a\u000ahttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_OlSITMTD2c

aVGive The Flesh Prevails a shot. Sapphire is one of many beautiful tracks, but none of them sound exactly the same. \u000a\u000aYou should also definitely try Gorod, Anata, Beyond Creation, Mithras, Soreption, Skeletonwitch and the new Omnihility album.

p1655
(lp1656
VGotta be honest, that sounded really bland because none of the "instruments" you used had any feeling of timbre to them. Made it sound like a bunch of old cellphones ringing at the same time. The bass drum just sounded like a mush of low pitched noises because there was no real attack or release to it (not a native speaker, hope you understand what I'm trying to say). Still nice effort though. I also tried my hand at some LSDJ a few years ago and realized just how hard doing chiptune is.
p1657
aVThanks for the input. The instruments are authentic wavs taken from game systems. I kinda wanted to keep the synths simple since so much is going on. Chiptune is harder then you think. Chiptuning death metal? Wicked hard. I'll keep what you said in mind next time.
p1658
aVEver given LSDJ a shot yourself? It gives you some nice tools to modify the various sounds a gameboy can produce. Also listen to some rainbowdragoneyes if you haven't already. He's really good at the whole chiptune metal thing and might give you some inspiration.

p1713
aVThanks for posting this, I'm gonna have to check out more by these guys
p1714
aVThanks for posting this. Chapters of Repugnance is easily one of the best death metal albums ever, and this band definitely deserves much more praise than they get. As a guitar player, the songwriting ability these guys have is incredible. To any musicians out there, take some time to pay attention to the compositions these guys come up with. Most of it is based on Schoenberg's 12 tone system. It really goes to show how overlooked metal musicians are. \u000a\u000aFun fact, this band started as a father and son project
p1715
aVThese guys really do have some brilliant stuff. [Their new one](http://www.metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/defeated-sanity-will-release-a-split-in-2015-with-defeated-sanity) is one of my most anticipated albums this year. I can only imagine what they're coming up with.
p1716
aVThis is my favorite album by Defeated Sanity, and one of my favorite brutal death albums of all time-- "Coerced Into Idolatry" drives me absolutely wild.  Katalepsy and Extermination Dismemberment are still my favorites though :-P

aVJust out of curiosity, what do people like about the super low growling in bands like this one and cannibal corpse? I like growling just not when its so deep it doesnt sound like they are saying words.
p1722
aVI like it because it's like another instrument. Plus, it's kinda hilarious and FUCKING BRUTAL.
p1723
aVThat makes sense, now that I listen to it again thinking of the vocals like another instrument it sounds pretty cool
p1724
aVThat's really what it comes down to. Not many people listen to brutal death metal for the lyrics. The vocals are meant to be another instrument or to add atmosphere.
p1725
aVEspecially on Chapters of Repugnance. AJ's vocals make me want to put my face through a concrete pillar
p1726
aVWhy are you subscribed here?\u000a\u000aFWIW the vocals in this are retarded.  All brutal death vocals sound like a toungeless spastic down syndrome fuck trying to do something like death metal.  \u000a\u000aThe vocals in Cannibal Corpse, especially Barnes' era, are awesome.

aVCryptopsy - Once Was Not. \u000a\u000aThis album is very special. Very brutal, with mesmerizing riffs and like literally the, (*one of the*), fastests drummings of any DM-album ever. \u000aThis song is just a fucking deathfest, though kinda slow in the beginning.\u000a*Endless Cemetary* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-CeddVf2Zc
p1779
aVHOLY SHIT another Endless Cemetery fan!!! I love that song to death and was actually listening to it only two hour ago. 
p1780
aVdefinitely check out nile. annihilation of the wicked is a good starting point. \u000a\u000aalso what do you mean you dont like death's production? are you talking about their early stuff or their progressive period?
p1781
aVI listened to the reissue of Leprosy because everyone said how great it was but its not very powerful or in your face, its quite a muddy production if that makes sense? For instance comparing it to Dying Fetus who have that really powerful, driving production, that's the kind of stuff i prefer personally
p1782
aValso dont totally give up on death. their later albums are absolutely vital for technical death metal. chuck schuldiner is one of the greatest in death metal, for his technical ability and his songwriting \u000a\u000a[Death- Spirit Crusher] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOXLc3rmK10)
p1783
aVI'm definitely open to listening to more Death, i've managed to get a big list of stuff here that i can roll through in the next couple of weeks :)
p1784
aVI just listened to that Death song and the guitar work is brilliant, if the rest of the album is in a similar vein then i'll definitely be giving it a listen!
p1785
aVaaah i see. their last album sound of perseverance is a huge step up. very clean , nice levels on everything. \u000a\u000a\u000aPig Destroyers album Terrifyer probably has my favorite production. grindcore isnt ordinarily my thing but it hits like a ton of bricks. the guitar tone just annihilates and there are a surprising  amount of awesome riffs, which grind usually lacks\u000a\u000aPig Destroyer- Thumbsucker&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny4gigSW17Y&amp;list=PLr3ViTcgePdhoSIGBTc6oBtLn-D5POYV3&amp;index=5 
p1786
aVGorgasm is a tried an true avenue (been around foreeeeever) for brutality, and they just came out with a new album (got to see them this past Saturday and they almost made my dick fall off). You might want to try older Devourment as well. Putrid Pile has super brutal riffs and great production quality. Unmerciful's cd Unmercifully Beaten is one of my favorites ever. Another band as far as really good production, try Abysmal Torment.
p1787
aVCattle Decapitation are huge in the modern death metal movement. Their latest album "Monolith of Inhumanity" is fantastic. Humanure was another great album. Travis Ryan is a monster of a vocalist. Listen to their song "Living, Breathing Piece of Defecating Meat"
p1788

aVInanimate existence, fallujah, arkaik, necrophagist, obscura and the faceless. Those are all the best in my opinion.
p1799
aVDepends. Melodic, or the brutal shit?  \u000aMelodic:  \u000aANYTHING AT ALL by Katatonia. They are the highest in the melo-death scene. They do something kind of similar to what Opeth does, but better (Opeth openly agrees with this). Can be described as atmospheric depressive music instrumental wise, kind of, but it has lyrics over it.  \u000aOpeth. Because they're also pretty swell.  \u000aSatariel's album Hydra (specifically Scattering the Timeweb, Claw the Clouds, and The Springrise)  \u000aKalmah (Neoclassical meets death with a bit of Finnish folk flavor)  \u000aInsomnium, especially Across the Dark and One for Sorrow  \u000aDark Tranquility, especially the songs The Treason Wall, Out of Nothing, and Weather the Storm (Under Insomnium's name, it was a guest appearance).  \u000aDeathspell Omega (dark melodic): Paracletus and the song Salowe Vision especially\u000aNe Obliviscaris: Portal of I (whole album is a masterpiece)  \u000a  \u000a\u000aThe Brutal Shit:  \u000aIngested: Endgame, Titanomachy, and The Surreption  \u000aMulk: La Putrilogie (cybergrind/pornogrind album)  \u000aAcrania: Susceptible to Retinal Based Reprogrammability  \u000aSuffocation: Human Waste  \u000aBeyond Creation: The Aura  \u000aNecrophagist: Entire discography, really  \u000aPusvomit: Stoned to Death  \u000aRings of Saturn: Dingir (Lucas Mann is a dick, though)  \u000aInfant Annihilator: The Palpable Leprosy of Pollution  \u000aNails: Abandon All Life (more grindcore depending who you ask, still dark and brutal as anything)  \u000aVomitous: Empires of Great Enslavement  \u000aModern Day Babylon (more djent, really, but still good)  \u000aDeicide: The Stench of Redemption (great soloing, which is rare in death metal)  \u000aGuttural Slug: Two kids from Finland doing some CRAZY slam shit. Two albums out, and they're growing at an amazing pace production/writing wise.  \u000aShadow of the Colossus: Self titled  \u000a

aVI have a serious question. What makes the music "destructive"? I'm not saying it's not a great album, because it is great. It sounds like what you would get if Death, Suffocation and Cannibal Corpse had an awesome little child. I am interested in the words we, as metal fans, use to describe music.\u000a\u000aQuick Edit: 1996 was also the year None So Vile was released. I have a bit of an obsession with that album.

aVPeople like different things, you will always have people arguing "only their old shit is good" without actually listening to "new garbage" at all!\u000a\u000aBut i do agree with some of them, metal is taking a questionable direction.\u000a\u000aAnyways this album is pure gold.\u000a\u000aOne thing that always amazes me is how replayable it is! \u000aI listened to it a shitload of times and i still get the same feeling of joy. \u000a\u000aAnd yes, Slaughter of the Soul is better, but that doesn't make this album any less brilliant.
p1877
aVI got this album on vinyl, it's a real winner. Different from their older stuff, but in a good way.
p1878
aVAs a fan of AtG for about 20 years, I  bought At War With Reality two months ago. \u000a\u000aI've probably listened to it 20-30 times at least. The key changes and melodies/harmonies are just what I'd expect, plenty of dynamic textural changes. \u000a\u000aI freaking love it. I would have said the terminal spirit disease EP was my favorite release by them, but after this album, I'm not so sure anymore
p1879
aVExactly!
p1880
aVI started getting into AtG and Carcass around the same time, and they both disbanded before I got to catch em live.\u000a\u000aSaw Carcass a few years ago, was amazing. Didn't buy tickets to MDF to see AtG. Kicking myself for it.\u000a\u000aThe new Carcass after 17 years was pretty good, but the new AtG? \u000a\u000aIt's a classic IMO. The intertwining bass guitar melodies and harmonies and changing drum textures, it gets stuck in my brain all the time. \u000a\u000aI'm honestly happiest that a band I respect so much is doing new material 20 years later that isn't like, metallica's LOAD or something, it's not this washed up faded imitation of itself, this is bad ass materiel, and they didn't release garbage in between. \u000a\u000aThey might come back here again, and how can I have anything but respect for that? \u000a\u000aTrvest godfathers ov melodic metal \u005cm/\u000a\u000aPeople that are AtG fans that diss this album? I dunno, maybe they just haven't listened to it enough. So much has changed in global world culture, your day is so distracted by internet and infinite amounts of music and sound and stupid memes and videos, and really absorbing a piece of music,  especially this good, requires a focus. \u000a\u000aThe first time I listened to it, I was like, well, it was ok, it sounds like AtG, but, the more I listened, the more I was just like, everything about this album is exactly what I wanted it to be. No track disappoints, every track delivers. \u000a\u000aend rant.

p1965
aVAren't distorted guitars what made metal different from other music? I would think most bands would sound pretty weak without distortion and guttural vocals. Way to go on being a fucking tool though
p1966
aVI just find it counterproductive to mix the Death Metal genre with this time of song structure. Feels low energy to me. Not trying to start a flamewar.
p1967
aVSorry I was a prick. I can't argue that heaviness is being lost in many bands with the melodic tag. I just thought the argument kinda sucked. Amon Amarth isn't the heaviest band ever and the melodic tag proves that, but to compare it to Disney music seems far-fetched considering even cannibal corpse sounds weak when done in Disney scale. I usually don't take heavy bands very serious when I hear they are some sort of melodic music, that alone is counterintuitive to me. 
p1968
aVYeah I was being a bit of a prick myself with the Disney comparison. Well at least we can agree on the melody being a factor.

"Tomb of the Mutilated" is a classic, genre-defining album. Other bands of note, not like Cannibal but may still fall into the Death Metal category (depending on who you ask, anyway) and are worthy of checking out to see where your interests expand:\u000a\u000a* Meshuggah (ethereal mathmetal) http://youtu.be/PoHa48lqsqE\u000a* Behemoth (blackened death) http://youtu.be/EpxyrPTaWfM\u000a* Arch Enemy (female fronted cockmetal) http://youtu.be/MrSqeS8Ya-E\u000a* Keep of Kalessin (euro melodic) http://youtu.be/4zdeFp6GLwM?t=1m10s\u000a* Amon Amarth (viking drinking metal) http://youtu.be/M-43pOqheMY\u000a* Opeth (progressive dadmetal) http://youtu.be/adOWWbEfyiQ\u000a* Fleshgod Apocalypse (epicmetal employs female leads occasionally) http://youtu.be/LXLl68Llf8E\u000a* Nightwish (only because you said female leads) (I can't bring myself to link a song)\u000a* Immortal (your intro to black metal ;) http://youtu.be/gUaFD4JFU8c\u000a

aVThis needs to be higher up. OP comes to /r/deathmetal saying she likes death metal, dude provides death metal. 
p2035
aVYes, all of you did deliver and so NEATLY, too. Everything has bullet points and explanations and such.  Who knew metalheads were so organized?  \u000a\u000aNow, I'm REALLY into death metal and you all are my pushers. :)
p2036
aVWhat a list!  Brownie points for the lovely bullet points and intro.  I feel like there should be a whole university class just for this (and I want to teach it, someday).\u000a\u000aSo far, I'm loving Suffocation (the band, not the act...ha!...little metal joke there).\u000a\u000aTo answer your question: during a recent late-night Youtube binge (I like to call it my "research") I stumbled onto a youtube vid of Kill or Become with lyrics.  I decided to give it a shot since a few years ago I worked a metal show (bartender) and remember how interesting it was to me (I wasn't exactly entranced, but I wasn't repulsed, either). I don't recall if any of the bands were Cannibal Corpse or not (I remember the singer of one band had a really ornate and possibly animatronic monster mask), but a seed had been planted (or began festering, whatever you prefer).  So, long story short, I clicked, watched the lyrics and thought they were simple but really creative.  Plus, I love anything zombie-related so that also helped!!  \u000a\u000aAlso, I can honestly say that I giggled (yes, GIGGLED) at the "FIRE UP THE CHAINSAW!" verse.  
p2037
aVThis guy brought the goods here. I can't recommend Severed Savior enough. Incredible band, as well as Gorguts and Decrepit Birth. Suffocation is also one of the best live dm bands anyone can hope to see. I'd also like to say to give the new Disentomb album a listen. It's called "Misery" and it might be the best dm release this year so far at least for me.\u000a\u000aA few other bands along these same lines that I may add would be Defeated Sanity, Spawn of Possession, Disgorge, Gorerotted, Arsis (A Celebration of Guilt), First Fragment, Wormed, and Augury, to name just a few.\u000a\u000aFor a list of bands featuring female members as well, give Abnormality and Cerebral Bore a try. For something a little more well known try out Arch Enemy when they still had Angela. Their not as heavy or technical as some of these other bands but they're a good start for someone with interest in the genre.
p2038
aVHere are a few of my favourite bands (might be less deathy than you're looking for, but hey ho!):\u000a\u000a[Arch Enemy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InRMwptcgAo) is a good band with an excellent female singer (growler).\u000a\u000a[Beyond Creation] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzAnRLfZOY) are one of my favourite bands, kind of technical but still with some awesome riffs and gorgeous growls.\u000a\u000a[Bloodbath] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_dynl-vnzw) are a great death metal band, good growls, interesting lyrics.\u000a\u000a[Fallujah] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WpQ8MlOoX0) are interesting, lots of different styles and 'movements' within their tracks, with heavy bits and more melodic parts.\u000a\u000a[Vale of Pnath] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1V__kzkIdw) are growing on me each time I listen to them, great riffs and good growls.\u000a\u000a[Ne Obliviscaris] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wa4zqBwPVE) are AMAZING, but maybe more melodic. Good deathy growls, with clean vocals too, and a VIOLIN. Love them.\u000a\u000a[Amon Amarth] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw0pylT0Tg0) - they're Vikings, what else do you need to know? :)\u000a\u000aIf you want more melodic stuff, check out [Dark Tranquility] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddujei86caE), [Be'lakor] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbD9ev7AzKU), [Barren Earth] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9I_O7mS1sI), and [Insomnium] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBZ5SLJmfdw)
p2039
aVSome amazing picks here. I just discovered Fallujah and Ne Obliviscaris a month or so ago and love both. Arch Enemy, DT, Be'lakor, and Insomnium are also all great picks.
p2040
aVThank you :) Hardly anyone seems to know about Fallujah, which is a shame, but hopefully word will spread. And thanks to NeO I have to continually fight the urge to buy a violin...
p2041
aVNe Obliviscaris is amazing. Their new album "Citadel" is definitely one of my favorite albums of 2014.\u000a\u000aAlso, Be'lakor is supposedly coming out with a new album this year. :)
p2042
aVIt's a masterpiece to be sure. I didn't know about Be'lakor, I'll be sure to look out for it!
p2043
aVThank you!  Arch Enemy is now one of my tops.  I love how they ease you into it with a brutal appetizer then, finally, whet your appetite with the rest.  I think this may be my favorite type of intro since most of the songs I've heard involved them just smashing a riff over your head then screaming/growling at you for getting in the way of their guitar.  \u000a\u000aEDIT: also, Ne Obliviscaris - Xenoflux makes me feel like Final Fantasy went brutal.  Love it!  Thank you, again!!!
p2044
aVYou're welcome! Always happy to help a fellow female metalhead explore the genre :)
p2045
aVThought of some more! \u000a\u000a[Carcass] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaXS4nAx0jU)\u000a\u000a[Meshuggah] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc98u-eGzlc) - technical death metal, an interesting if hard-to-get-into subgenre\u000a\u000a[DevilDriver] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ySpk3ErFd0) - I consider this to be "happy death metal".\u000a\u000a[Opeth] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhohQNdSt7g) - a bit different, but definitely worth checking out in my opinion.\u000a\u000a[Kalmah] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcxlexAJycY) - more melodic death metal
p2046
aV/u/Mostly-Harmlessish gave a great list already. I also recommend [Allageon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx9NLiA9Kk8). They're more technical death, but they're absolutely fantastic and their music videos are generally pretty funny.

aVAllegaeon is fantastic!  I love how it just builds and moves right into it instead of bashing you over the head right from the start.  Although, I can't say I'm totally turned off by technical, either. \u000a\u000aI actually just finished the dishes (and a beer) to this. :D
p2048
aVGlad you liked them. Check out their albums when you get a chance. They released a new one this year and it was one of my favorites.
p2049
aVDying fetus! !! 
p2050
aV[Abnormality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBf1kM0wBfg)'s a pretty solid death metal band with a good female vocalist.
p2051
aVYES YES, A THOUSAND TIMES YES!  This goes right into the DM playlist.  Thanks for the link!
p2052
aVGiving them a listen for the first time now - how did I miss this band?!\u000a\u000aI am LOVING this thread
p2053
aVSome close relatives of CC's sound are Incantation, Deicide, Blood Red Throne, Hate Eternal, Dead Congregation, Deeds of Flesh, Skinless, Disma, Autopsy. \u000a\u000a\u000a

p2055
aVDisma 100%
p2056
aVWell there's 30 years of death metal to cover so you need to narrow down what you like, then work from there. There's stylistic and regional sounds so the spectrum is huge.\u000a\u000aBands I'd recommended: Sarcofago, Deicide, Massacra, Bolt Thrower\u000a\u000aAs far as female leads go: there's a lot more than there used to be, but honestly women can do the guttural vocals just as well as anyone else and it can be hard to differentiate the singer's gender. Just listen to Fuck the Facts to see what I mean.

aVDeath metal is good stuff, but I'd also like to mention (amidst the deluge of great suggestions) that you check out other subreddits/genres as well. Here are a few to get you going:\u000a\u000a/r/metal\u000a\u000a/r/thrashmetal\u000a\u000a/r/sludge\u000a\u000a/r/blackmetal\u000a\u000a/r/folkmetal\u000a\u000aThere are so many genes and so many subreddits. Check the sidebar in /r/metal for more.\u000a\u000aAlso, Decapitated. Really enjoy those guys. Polish death metal.
p2068
aVHoly crap, have I got homework to do.  I've been clinking on EVERY link and I can't get enough!  Some things don't hit me right away but, then I stumble onto something that just pulls me in deeper and deeper.  And, believe it or not, it's almost calming my brain down since my thoughts tend to scatter around this time of night.  Thanks so much!!!!
p2069
aVYou have no idea how much joy it brings me to spread my love of metal to other people. I'm so glad you're enjoying it, and more than happy to help.\u000a\u000aAlso, Cerebral Bore is INTENSE death metal with a female lead.\u000a\u000aStay metal.
p2070
aVYou have no idea how much job I'm finding in metal now!  I just vacuumed the rugs, washed the dishes, bought my Sping semeter textbooks AND washed the dog to Arch Enemy, Falujah, and Dabauchery (among the many other in my playlist)!  I'm actually enjoying myself!!  Thanks for the metal love! :D
p2071
aVEve household chores are more intense with metal.
p2072
aVHonestly, while hearing all these reccomendations is always really fun, I personally love the feeling of finding bands myself. I have to side with /u/metal_for_the_masses and say check out some of the metal subreddits, I also reccomend sifting through [bandcamp](http://www.bandcamp.com), [youtube](http://www.youtube.com) via recommendations in the sidebar when listening to bands you like, and even [Metal-Archives](http://www.metal-archives.com/).\u000a\u000aAlso, as a fellow female, I would love another female to discuss metal with, so if you like, message me sometime.
p2073
aVYAY!  I'm just getting started so thanks for the suggestions!  I'm slowly sliding down the metal rabbit hole.  I click on one suggestions and it leads to another hour of clicking.  I'm on rehearsal footage from Atheist's early years.  Thanks for being so welcoming! :)
p2074
aVNot a problem. Also, that seems to be how it goes, I often find myself with a multitude of stuff to listen to, and I never can listen to all of it, there is just so much. I go through phases of discovery, and then having to go back and appreciate what I have discovered since it's new thing after new thing. Luck on your metal adventures!
p2075
aVSince there are already some good general suggestions here, I will just list some of the bands with female lead and backing vocals that I would recommened.\u000a\u000a[**Augury**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Augury/27517)'s [Concealed](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5EE63B8311F374EA) is one of my favourite albums of all time. The female vocals so seamlessly compliment the music like no other album I have heard since.\u000a\u000a[**Visceral Evisceration**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Visceral_Evisceration/3026)'s [Incessant Desire for Palatable Flesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RRxT8aRUr8) is a very interesting album. Death/Doom with backing female vocals. \u000a\u000a[**Arch Enemy**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Arch_Enemy/10) is an obvious choice. I haven't really liked anything they have put out in the last 10 years but I do still enjoy listening to [Wages of Sin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8fuj5PoxMw) and [Anthems of Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1rASg_RyA)\u000a\u000a\u000aLeaving death metal...\u000a\u000a[**Unexpect**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Unexpect/302) is an especially weird female fronted band from Montreal. [In a Flesh Aquarium](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCB2821CCA8148073) and their latest [Fables of the Sleepless Empires](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBA6854CDB1DDBF42) are two amazing albums.\u000a\u000a[**Witch Mountain**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Witch_Mountain/10934) is great. Unfortuantely Uta just left the band but [Cauldron of the Wild](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ALGLx1orRGw4U9y9QlGgWAvHsuFykB7e4H) is still an awesome album. I have only listened to their latest once, but I liked what I heard.\u000a\u000a[**ReVamp**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/ReVamp/3540307644)'s [Wild Card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChQBR_QySHQ) is a great album. Saw them live and they were amazing. Floor has an amazingly powerful voice. \u000a\u000aSome others that I haven't listen to in a long time: [**Epica**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Epica/6716), [**After Forever**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/After_Forever/526), [**Within Temptation**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Within_Temptation/1006), [**Nightwish**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nightwish/39), [**Leaves' Eyes**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Leaves%27_Eyes/26706)\u000a\u000a**EDIT**: \u000aAlso can't forget [**Into Eternity**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Into_Eternity/613) who are newly female-fronted. I have seen them play live 3 or 4 times with Amanda and she fucking kicks ass. Can't wait for a new album. If you haven't listen to them before it would be well worth your time to listen to [Buried in Oblivion](http://youtu.be/zwYtMTIDNgY) and [The Scattering of Ashes](http://youtu.be/pKycKUtb97M). Also check out Amanda's other band [**The Order of Chaos**](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/The_Order_of_Chaos/123729)
p2076
aVI'm digging Augury.  The female vocals threw me off at first but then I slowly began to understand.\u000a\u000aAlso, Arch Enemy was already in my top 5 but I wasn't ready for *Wages of Sin*.  THAT, is what I was looking for.  I like the buildup and the way they finally work into it.\u000a\u000aAnd thanks for the *Scattering of Ashes* add on.  I love that, as a first time listener, you're kind of just along for the ride since you have no idea where the song is going! :)
p2077
aVThere are too many bands, and too diverse of sounds, to even begin asking for recommendations yet.  Just explore, explore, explore.
p2078
aVThank you!  Yes, all I've been doing since this post is just click, click, click.  It's giving me a better understanding of what I like and a nice appreciation of how much really goes into the music.  Especially since the growls can be a bit off-putting, at first.

aVI looked up *To Hell With God* and I really like it!  The growls at about 1:40 really drew me in.  I definitely hear Dethklok in there and it's very much my style.  And, after listening to the first song (*The Beginning*) of the Till Death Do Us Part album, I'm sold.  \u000a\u000aAlso, I just found [Atheist - Second to Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_1wwEETVXM) and I'm digging it.

aVim gonna be seeing them with my favorite band behemoth live feb 28th in ny. but sme recommendations. cattle decapitation, thy art is murder, decrepit birth, pathology, dying fetus, behemoth, deathspell omega, septicflesh, arch enemy, rings of saturn, cerebral bore and my other favorite FALLUJAH edit: boreworm is amazing too.
p2084
aVI wish I could link you but I'm mobile right now but I can list off a few names. Death Metal isn't all the same and there just so happen to be a great bit of subgenres that fall under "death metal". \u000a\u000aNecrophagist is a pretty great technical death metal band and is typically the first band you'll hear from the genre. ( Fermented Offal Discharge, Only Ash Remains )\u000a\u000aFleshgod Apocalypse mixes elements if classical music with metal. It's pretty fast paced but equally beautiful. ( Test out their newest album and their EP titled "Mafia")\u000a\u000aAmon Amarth is a melodic death metal that is only beaten by few. They even tour America so they're pretty popular. ( A Thousand Years of Oppression)\u000a\u000aBe'lakor is another melodic death metal band and is unbeatable. Completely my opinion. ( From Scythe to Sceptre, Abeyance. Their newest album is ridiculously good. Even for untamed ears. )\u000a\u000aIf you want heavier bands, the lyrics tend to get out of control but the music is still good. Many times, this genres loses good music to the constant "who can go faster" and "who can be heavier" competition that newer guys are putting out. As far as good music goes, 2014 was a REALLY great year for death metal and you chose a good time to hop in. Go check out a list of albums that came out last year and you shouldn't be disappointed. A few examples of bands that really stood out are:\u000a\u000aInferi\u000aAlterbeast\u000aArchspire\u000a\u000aThose three bands are pretty different and if you find yourself liking any of these more than the other, let me know and I'll see if i can spawn any new suggestions from that. Welcome to the genre though. Beware of elitists and have fun. Enjoy the music for what it is rather than what you associate it with and you'll love it just as much as we do. Cheers. 
p2085
aVI would definitely listen to "Death's" first two real Death Metal albums, Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy. There are lots of brutal death metal roots in it and they are considered the first Death Metal band. Their later albums become more technical and melodic so those wouldn't really put your brutal on but they're still an awesome listen. \u000a\u000a[Death - Pull the Plug is a very good sample song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dYYUR21_G9c)\u000a\u000aBehemoth is more Cannibal Corpse tiered and have that brutal sound but they are Blackened Death Metal so they sound a tad different in terms of instruments. Check out The Apostasy album and take a listen to some songs to see if you like it. They are very anti christian so be warned not to play them anywhere near a church. \u000a\u000a[Behemoth - At The Left Hand ov God  is a very good sample song as well and yes their of is spelled with a v](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zzz0YVEgT5U)\u000a\u000aGood luck to you \u005cm/\u000a\u000aEdit: added links

aVOoh, I forgot them- love those guys! Is their newer stuff worth a listen? I've only heard older stuff.
p2174
aVNewer stuff is not really death metal.  It's good, but more or less just straight prog rock.
p2175
aVEh I like lots of stuff, I'll give them a try. Thanks
p2176
aVYeah, I'm a prog rock fan too, so I'm into it, but I could see most death metal fans thinking it's a bit weak.

VBehemoth put on one of the best shows i think i've ever seen. Granted, Cannibal Corpse had a short set (or at least it seemed like it), but Behemoth blew them out of the water. 
p2331
aVJust saw them in Philly last night, yeah Corpse's set was pretty short. Behemoth were legends as usual, I liked their stage setup.\u000a\u000aAeon killed, their drummer is not of this world. Can't stand their cheesy lyrics though.
p2332
aVI was there too. I only stayed for CC's first two songs. Their sets aren't that exciting anymore. Same songs and you get Corpsegrinder comedy hour. Behemoth definitely killed it. I went ape shit when the intro to Slaves Shall Serve started up.
p2333
aVHaha yeah, George wouldn't shut up about the horse-head guy. The first couple songs were pretty shaky across the board but they locked everything in pretty well after that. I'm an... aging... drummer and I can totally relate to the fact Paul's been dealing with back issues for a while, but he soldiered on like the berserker he is, got better as the set progressed.

p2618
aVThis doesn't sound very much like death metal to me. Not looking to knock it, or argue whether this band is objectively "good" or "bad", I'm being serious, what qualities of death metal does this band showcase? The only ones I hear are hard vocals and a double bass pedal, which are qualities that lots of other genres also exhibit.
p2619
aVThey call their genre "Atmospheric Death Metal", which I guess is a rather new sub-genre of Death Metal? Just sharing what I thought was some good music worth people taking some time to listen to, they've made a rather amazing transformation from Deathcore, then to more Modern Death Metal, then finally to this new sound of their last EP and latest album, which I think is rather unique and refreshing. If they keep going at the pace their at, you're going to be hearing the name Fallujah a lot more often buddy. :P

p2646
aVI like your attitude, there should more people like you, it's metal enjoy it! 
p2647
aVuh... yea ... thanks.
p2648
aVI think that they have a sound that is very diverse and can be interpreted in many ways. I interpret it as death metal, others may interpret it however they want, prog rock, melodic metal, whale metal, technical metal. They can't really be described with one genre so I suppose they're not full death metal, but they certainly have death metal elements; blast beats, fast double base, and many 6/8 phrases that I hear in most if not all death metal bands. I know many people dispute whether or not gojira is death metal but personally as a fan and musician of death metal I enjoy them very much and I think they fit in nicely with most death metal bands, just my thoughts. 
p2649
aVYour description of the characteristics of death metal lead me to believe you do not know a lot about death metal. But hey, thats ok.
p2650
aVI wasn't trying to generalize all of death metal with those three characteristics, I was just stating some things that goijira does that can be described as death metal elements. They may not be as brutal as some bands like cattle decapitation or aborted or pathology, which is probably closer to just "brutal death metal", they have a kind of an old school feel to them, when I saw them live they covered a morbid angel song, which I think is where they get much of their influence, growing up listening to old school death then putting their own twist on it and making it into something entirely different, and I think it's really refreshing to listen to. Make of it what you will not everyone has to agree haha. 
p2651
aVI wouldnt deny Gojira definitely have death metal elements most notably from Morbif Angel who were a lot more atmospheric and spiritual than their peers.
p2652
aVAre you saying that fast double bass and blast beats are not characteristics of death metal?\u000a\u000aYou come off as being very patronizing and without really explaining what you think death metal is.
p2653
aVBut hey, thats ok.
p2654

p2715
(lp2716
VYep, absolutely. Let your tastes wander for a while. Listen to a bunch of jazz, or classical, or electro-rock, or whatever you feel iike. Then one day, you might get the itch to listen to something **CRUSHING**. And if you do get that itch, then you can get right back into the heavy stuff. No need to force it. Happens to me at least every 18 months, it's like a sabbatical. Wander off, indulge other listening curiosities, cleanse the palate. Then one day get the urge to blast the filthiest grind-tech-death you have. 
p2717
aVTrue!\u000a\u000aIt's like eating same food each day: it gets boring after some time even if it is good.
p2718
aVI got into Adele and Kings of Leon for awhile last year because all my favourite metal bands grew stale. I listened to their entire discography too many times so I went off and listened to the complete opposite on the musical spectrum. But I just listened to a few albums that got me into metal and they sent chills up my spine. Feels so good.
p2719
aVI'm much less enthusiastic about death metal than I used to be, but I still enjoy it once in a while.\u000a\u000aTaking a long pause helps. Maybe as long as a month, or even a year.\u000a\u000aAlso you might discover something new in music you already listened if you, basically, look at it from another angle after a long pause.
p2720
aVThis was me.  I was mainly into death metal for so long and i kind of got bored with it. I started listening to more black metal, grind, hardcore punk, prog rock, noise,doom and other stuff. Then i got into electronic music( Zombi, Tangerine Dream, Majeure) stuff like that. While i still listened to metal all the time, i felt like it was refreshing to go back to death metal. Like another user commented, when you want something crushing, i would always go back to death metal. While i don't listed to it as much nowadays, i still enjoy the hell out of it. 
p2721
aVNope, this is why I listen to pretty much every genre of metal. Gotta mix it up.
p2722
aVYep I'm kinda going through the same thing right now. Too much of anything will get old pretty quick (or in 23yrs). I've been trying to find other music to dabble in but so far,it's not going so well. Yoshida bros and that "nuclear" song by the guy who's name I can't remember are all I have found so far. Pls send help
p2723
aVlisten to Trenchrot and Obliteration\u000a\u000abest two death metal albums of the past two years
p2724
aVThe only death metal I stomach these days are stuff like Ulcerate and Pyrrhon, then bestial. 
p2725
aVi feel this way for years. i only listen to underground death metal bands in my locale these days. no point paying attention to most magazine and big label metal
p2726
aVI know what you mean. After a while it all sounds like blasts and growls and whatnot. Anything will get tiring if thats all you listen to. I will never define myself as anything other than a metal head, but dammit do I enjoy everything Modest Mouse puts out. Dont let this music become stale,  listen to everything and appreciate music for music's sake. But remember,  if you need to feel like crushing skulls, there will always be Tomb of the Mutilated! 
p2727
aVSame here. I'm going through a hip-hop phase right now.\u000a\u000aThat and turbtablism.
p2728
aVPrior to this moment I think I had heard death metal described as pretty much everything else except "kinda boring."  But yes I actually had a rap phase for several years ( not proud of this but it happened) and I pursued it until I found "the underground" and then I definitely got that "kinda boring" feeling.  I sold it all and never went back.  Perhaps the rap thing for me was "just an image" as JewsusChrist says.  I had the total package complete with $5k car stereo.  Now I'm back to metal full time and if I'm not hearing it live it's being played on a Hyundai.  Good luck I'm sure the feeling will pass and you'll be back into music of some kind soon!
p2729
aVIf the shit you used to listen to doesn't do it for you... you failed. You were looking for the image, not the music.
p2730
aVFuckin posers right?\u000a\u000aI guarantee anybody who tells you that you have to "stay tr00" to any kind of metal, whether death, black or whatever is fairly young or just stupid. They are the ones in it for the image, as they try so hard to stick to it.\u000a\u000aTo OP:\u000a\u000aListen to new types of music, I do this all the time and find myself coming back to death metal when the time is right. It's healthy to go through phases. Sadly, we live in an age where a lot of ideas have been tried and tested and the old school stuff cannot be touched because there's only so much that can be done when you place boundaries around your sound. It's only natural to grow weary of these walls and notice similarities between bands. \u000a\u000aSwitch it up and try different genres within metal. Even *gasp* try something completely new. Jazz is very similar to metal in many ways and hip-hop might do it for you too. The funny thing is, once you've taken a break, your love of death metal comes surging back to you when you least expect it to. 
p2731
aVThanks man! I agree with you indeed. I've been always opened to any kind of music. It depends on how much creativity the music has. So I don't think it's permanent.
p2732
aVOr get drunk, that usually helps temporarily!
p2733
aVPretty much what joeay said. Don't you worry none, you'll never really leave death metal fully. Try jazz (if you thought heavy metal was varied jazz is even more so). Also try not listening to anything for a couple of days, that also helps. You'll be blasting death metal at 11 again before you know it.

p2747
aVBlacklist?
p2748
aVhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMetal/comments/20umlq/the_blackest_list/\u000a\u000a&gt; The reason? It should be obvious enough, but in the interest of thoroughness I'll spell it out: posting eminent mainstays of the genre adds nothing to the community. As you'll notice if you peruse past posts, songs by the likes of Bathory, Mayhem, Darkthrone, etc. will receive a large number (30+) of upvotes, and will often receive zero comments, or if they do, they will be fluff like "classic!" or something similarly vacuous. This community was never intended to be a museum of black metal, nor even an archive. Its purpose is the elucidation of the darker regions of the genre where those with a pre-existing familiarity with it can share and interact with like cohorts. For newcomers to black metal, the blacklist will serve the dual purpose of a gateway to the genre, much as /r/metal 's does for that community. \u000a\u000aBasically, if the point of the sub is to discover new music it's kinda tedious to post the givens. Like going to /r/country (I assume that exists) and posting "hey y'all ever heard of David Allen Coe??"\u000a\u000aI kindof agree with the idea. But then I says to myself, I says "self, maybe we should remain accessible to people who are just getting into the genre! I mean it doesn't cost you anything to skip over a post." And then I agree with that too. \u000a\u000aSo basically either way, I'm cool. And I just wasted everyone's time who read this far.\u000a\u000aRock on \u005cm/
p2749
aVAh ok, I see the point, but think it's unnecessary. I mean there are so many bands out there, others might be hooked on a new one and been listening to them for awhile and see a cannibal corpse post one day and be reminded of that Sun's and band. It's good for nostalgic purposes and like you said, newcomers. But, I'm in no control over that. \u000a\u000aEdit: song*...Fuck Swype.

(lp2767
VI'd say you're off to a great start!  I'm enjoying listening to it, sure.  I guess I'd categorize it as melodic death/thrash, so I can hear a mix of thrash and death vocals working well.  My main criticism would be that some riffs seem to repeat a bit too often for my taste, but vocals will help a lot with that.  Still, when everything is in groups of 4 it gets a bit predictable, you know?  Or, say, I noticed several riffs that alternated between holding long notes and tremolo-picking for several repetitions (Song 1, Song 6).  But it's sure as hell way better than anything I've made in my apartment so far, and I imagine I'd be in the pit if I saw this band at a show.
p2768
aVnice, thanks! I will work on the predictability. Once I add vocals, I'd say you wont notice the repetitions because I know how to plan out the vocals to make the songs "come alive." I can't wait to get started on it.
p2769
aVYeah, you're leaving space for things yet to come.  Something the band I'm in is arguably terrible at. :P  Get a full band to jam these songs a few different ways and you'll see them come together.\u000a\u000aI'm curious what you've used for the drums on those tracks?  I'm pretty new to writing and haven't found a VST I like for programming them (or are you playing an electric kit?).  Whatever you're doing ends up sounding pretty decent!
p2770
aVaddicitve drums metal pack.\u000a\u000aI picked something thats close to what I like and went ahead and tweaked it a bit. Still working on it though. I'm always changing sounds until I think its perfect, the way I would hear it in my head. Its hard, but its getting there.
p2771
aVFair enough, from what I've heard Addictive Drums are good and sort of a standard thing to be familiar with so it's worth considering if I want to take this seriously.  I'm trying to write some straightforward death/thrash for a mobile game I'm making so the programmed drums could end up in the finished product.  It's definitely cool hearing what you've done with AD, so thanks for sharing.

p2790
aVI third this. The energy I get when I'm listening to some songs is just incredible. There are a couple of songs that ,no matter what I'm going through, they just give me so much energy and drive. And then there are some bands that show you that death metal doesn't have to be aggressive. Be'lakor is in my list of top five music groups/musicians of all time and not once have I heard someone say, "Let's fuck shit up to this."\u000a
p2791
aVI don't think I could have said it better
p2792
aV&gt;Because of the Fucking Energy and Power\u000a\u000aThis and I also have used death metal as a positive tool throughout my life to let out aggression, and to let go of anger and hate. It's like the music rages for me, and I can air the ugly out.
p2793
aV[deleted]
p2794
aV*implying you can understand the vocals*\u000a\u000aif you can, the metal is not death enough.
p2795
aVVocal intelligibility decreases with *brutality*, not death, silly! Why else would self-described Brutal Slam bands use so many more GODDAMN COCKAMAMIE MOTHERFUCKING PIG SQUEALS than everyone else?
p2796
aVCan I use the phrase 'God damn cockamamie motherfucking pig squeals' casually, please? I was dying. Hahahah!
p2797
aVPlease do. It makes life better.
p2798
aVI would look silly wearing the shirts without listening to the bands, so I really have no choice.
p2799
aVIt makes me feel powerful, intimidating, and in control. It feels like there is energy coursing through my body that drives me to do massive things. It doesn't allow for confusion or doubt, it is, it always will be, and it will not be reasoned with.\u000a\u000aIt is force in its purest form. Utter, waste-laying force.
p2800
aVBecause it's a stress release. Metalheads are often super nice people, and I think that has to do with letting our aggression out through our music. 
p2801
aV***RIFFS, MOTHERFUCKER.***
p2802
aVMy dad is a metalhead, so to me heavy metal is normal. Over the years I just gradually progressed from Maiden and Ozzy to heavier bands. Mine is a very typical story
p2803
aVi think death metal is actually really smart. certain concepts like alternate realties, sci--fi, misanthropy, outer space, animal rights,human despair are really interesting. and of course the empowerment. 
p2804
aVFor me, as a tech death fan, I am VERY appreciative of the technicality, speed, composition, etc but just in general I love the aggression and energy of death metal. As a drummer, I cream my pants constantly over the drumming of a lot of my favourite bands, and as someone who tried to play guitar but failed miserably I listen to and marvel at the insanity I hear on the guitar. And the vocals, which I hated at first (it was the drumming that initially got me into the genre) now complete the picture and I would never want to substitute them for something else. \u000a\u000aFrom a psychological standpoint, it's probably the power as said many times over by others. 
p2805
aVListening since 1997 I've come to find absolute beauty in the energy and heaviness. I liken it to classical music.
p2806
aVBecause extreme metal is the soundtrack to western civilization rotting.\u000a\u000aOnly death is real. 
p2807
aVI always make a political analysis of the music I listen to before I decide if I like it.
p2808
aVBecause it kicks the shit out of any other type of music
p2809
aVDeath metal is the musical equivalent of spicy food
p2810
aVIt tastes and feels amazing when you eat it at first, then in the end it turns your butthole into Nagasaki?
p2811
aVWhat's with this "chili makes your pooper explode"-thing? \u000a\u000aI've never experienced it and I'm beginning to suspect you're all a bunch of sissies!
p2812
aVHey guys, OP is a big fat lady HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
p2813
aVBecause, heavy.
p2814
aVBut why do we like such heavy music? 
p2815
aVI just dig it. I think we all have our own reasons for liking it.  Mine being, it's loud, brutal and it annoys the shit out of most people. 
p2816
aVI honestly don't think there's a good or satisfying answer for any single genre. Why does anyone like any genre of music? \u000a\u000aMusic grows in you. You develop your taste based upon your surroundings; friends (near, far or in cyberspace), family, what's cool in school etc. etc. etc. Culture.\u000a\u000aWe took a liking to this sound when we first heard it and things took off! Heaviness, brutality, intensity, speed. I don't think I am an especially violent or brutal person and I can't seem to find any connections between a personality and the music they listen to.
p2817
aVI wonder why more people don't like it. Possibly a mixture of fascination with death, horror films and music. 
p2818
aVThe most generic reason is simply because it sounds great.  Beyond that, I love the speed, heaviness, and aggression.  Growls, blast beats, and double bass make me happy and get the juices flowing.  The lyrics/topics of my favorite bands tend to address things that align with my interests and views on life (Heathenism, Vikings, Norse mythology, anti-religion, etc.).  I also think the musicians tend to be the cream of the crop and they write/perform things far more creative and complex than the mindless, simplistic garbage found in the mainstream.
p2819
aVI enjoy the atmosphere that the music provides in times of sadness, as well as any other times in my life. I enjoy the general community of intense energetic brotherhood I feel as well as actively participate in when I go to shows...which says something because I usually do not actively participate in many group activities where my enthusiasm is at least matched or welcomed universally...however, I notice that the solace that I find within this genre of music...often depresses me quite intensely, and I am unsure of how to make my preferred style of music not make me want to return to the void...to put it philosophically...I am stuck between the rock of reality...and a comforting, unforgiving, brutal, misanthropic, understanding, evil glorifying, 240+BPM, hardplace...if you get my drift.
p2820
aVBecause its music with substance most popular music is a catchy beat and a single phrase but death metal includes multiple elements of music jacked up to 11 and put on hyperspeed. 
p2821
aVProbably for the same reason I enjoy J-pop and Brian McKnight.
p2822
aVI listen to Death Metal for the aggressiveness of the music and lyrics. I actually find it soothing. No other music can get me going, so to speak, like Death Metal can.
p2823
aVBecause we are aware of the world we live in. To me, it is the sound of the planet traveling through infinite black space, and it is not a peaceful planet.

VBoth [Vomitory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4VEfpPtMo) and [Demonical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1qKOkEHEcE) are really close to Bloodbath in sound.\u000a\u000a**A few bands that sound fairly similar but not exact**\u000a\u000a[Corpsessed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpMzRwISF1U)\u000a\u000a[Drawn and Quartered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqyQIVT6BxA)\u000a\u000a[Tribulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgv4_zSdaxQ)\u000a\u000a[Deathchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyN_BEYpWHI)
p2904
aVCorpsessed is amazing, as is Krypts, which another commenter recommended. Both are on Dark Descent records, which is absolutely worth checking out. They have the best current death metal bands, in my personal opinion. 
p2905
aVVery familiar. Fantastic label.
p2906
aVhttp://giphy.com/gifs/132qeyvgJ2Al3i\u000a
p2907
aVI'll second Bloodbath being a fairly unique band, but for more modern bands with the old school Swedish death metal sound try Aeon, Entrails, Repugnant, Miseration, Ribspreader, Bastard Priest, Demonical, Funebrarum, Graveyard, Invidious, Krypts, Maim, Morbus Chron, Putrevore, and Tribulation. A lot of these bands don't quite have the same modern edge that Bloodbath has, though
p2908
aVEntombed, Dismember. Get Bloodbath's Wacken Carnage CD/DVD. You'll thank me in a death metal voice.
p2909
aVI too love bloodbath and I've been trying to find another band like them to no avail. However I will recommend another band that scratches the same itch that bloodbath does and that is Black Breath. They're not pure death metal but they are heavily inspired by the same bands and share the riffrastic approach to songwriting. Both of their albums and their EP are perfect 10's for me. Check out this song and let me know what you think http://youtu.be/UBYxpsg9fCg
p2910
aV"Escape from Death" off of Heavy Breathing sounds just like something off of an early '90s Entombed record. Love these dudes.

p2915
aVThese have all probably been mentioned BUT: Entombed, Dismember, Grave, Unleashed (first 3 albums), Entrails, Sorcery, We Are the Damned, Black Breath, and Trap Them (more of a crust punk/grindcore sound).
p2916
aVThere really isn't anything like Bloodbath.\u000a\u000aThey intentionally try to sound like a revamped version of classic death metal but with better production value.\u000a\u000aIf you do find something similar let us know, I would love to hear it!

p2924
aVThat's the thing.... there was no 'intro'. \u000aIR have no need for your useless traditional song structuring.
p2925
aVWell that's kind of a shitty response to someone bothering to listen to this. \u000a\u000aI'll be less nice and more honest. This in no way is death metal. No fast OR complex guitar riffs. No fast or complex drums. No fast or complex anything. Just a vocalist using a pitch shifter to give him an almost-growl and half-assed, slow guitar to back him up.
p2926
aV&gt;No fast OR complex guitar riffs. No fast or complex drums. No fast or complex anything.\u000a\u000aNone of those things are requirements of death metal, never have been. Also, there's no pitch shifting in this song, or from this band....nice try. the fact that you don't "get" this or Encoffination tells me all I need to know about you. You've been force fed a cookie cutter version of death metal that is neither challenging or original, just "fast" and seemingly "complex".....predictability is weakness.
p2927
aVNo, you've misread me completely. I just don't like this song. There is nothing to "get". Maybe this band has more, better stuff. Using this song as a gauge, I don't care to spend the time to find out. This song does not fit MY definition of Death Metal.\u000a\u000aI'm a bit of an old timer. You and this song remind me a LOT of Flipper and their fans back in the 80s. None of it fit any definition of punk music. Anyone who didn't "get it" just didn't understand punk. Just another hipster in another scene. \u000a\u000aI get that you really like this, and that's freakin great! Keep on promoting what you like to listen to. But, it's kinda shitty to try to talk down to anyone who disagrees with you.
p2928
aVIt's not the disagreement that I scoff at, to each their own. I scoff at the spreading of misinformation i.e. "this isn't death metal". If you don't like it, fine, but don't go around tryna act like it ain't what it is just cuz you ain't hip to it.

aV[They disagree](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Impetuous_Ritual/3540295292). \u000a\u000aThough it is blackened....it's still undeniably death metal.
p2933
aV&gt; undeniably death metal.\u000a\u000aNo.  The track you posted was not Death Metal.  Why would you post a non-Death Metal track to /r/deathmetal ?\u000a\u000aIf Taylor Swift changed her profile to say "Death Metal" and listed a page on metal-ballsax.com that doesn't make her music Death Metal.

VI'd love to hear each album with each vocalist.
p2940
aVI've actually seen them play this live with Lord Worm, it was fantastic.
p2941
aVOh yeah, I did too at the Chicago house of blues. Got to shake his hand too.\u000a\u000aI meant studio recorded.\u000aAlthough he is credited with back up vocals
p2942
aVLord worm sounds like a dying dog. Love the guy and seem him live tons of times but Mike has more technical talent.
p2943
aVI've noticed that Cryptopsy's fanbase will destroy anyone who doesn't like Lord Worm. Being a fan of more modern death metal, I didn't discover Cryptopsy until their self-titled 2012 album. Fucking awesome album. Went back and listened to None So Vile...and I really hate it. \u000a\u000aWorm's vocals seem totally random, rarely on beat, and without finesse. I'm sure those are the reasons that some people dig it, but I like my death metal to be a little more refined. 
p2944
aVThank you. I have had Lord Worm personally feed me an earthworm during a performance and will always cherish that memory but like you said he is just not very refined.
p2945
aVnone so vile is my favorite album ever. i have a gig this halloween where i'm playing through it in its entirety with a bunch of local metal musicians.\u000a\u000abut i get your opinion. it's kind of sloppy in a lot of parts....but thats what I love about it. It's like everything's just about to come apart but they keep it together just enough to keep it going like a chaotic whirl. 
p2946
aVI feel that. Not my cup of tea, but I can see why people might like it.\u000a\u000aHonestly, I'm just glad Cryptopsy has been able to be consistently good over the years despite line up changes...minus that one deathcore album that we do not speak of.

p2977
(lp2978
VIt sounds kinda over-worked for my tastes. If technical/ADD metal is what you're going for then great, but the track is lacking groove or a clear structure IMO.\u000a\u000aThat said, the songwriting and execution is really solid.
p2979
aVI really enjoy fast metal :) and this track is super constant, you're right. But hey thanks for your kind words!\u000a\u000aWhat bands do you love? I'm curious because most people think music isn't good if its not they're favorite genre (like technical metal)...but you still recognized my stuff as "solid" which is awesome :)
p2980
aVOh it's a great track, I just like a little more groove with my technical metal (like Obscura or Cynic).
p2981
aVI love Cynic ! But yeah, I've been trying to find my own sound and everything is technical...so I guess I'm technical haha\u000aOh well. I really do love all kinds of metal though, one of my absolute favorites is Protest The Hero.
p2982
aVreally like this, the riffage is neat and its got a heavy sound. think the drums are too electronic for my tastes tho, the general production could be much more raw and organic in my opinion
p2983
aVIt's pretty good overall, it would be nice to hear this with a more solid recording. Some of the slower more melodic parts around 1:23 could do with more low end to compliment the melody on top of it. \u000a\u000aAlso if you were to do vocals with this I'd prefer to hear more a more harsh Grave style vocal track rather than something like Dying Fetus vocals(although that's just personal preference) also this could be a recording problem as opposed to the actual song itself but it could do with a bit more gain and crunch throughout.\u000a\u000aOverall I must say I like it and would listen to it if it was fully fledged out, for a rough recording there is a lot of potential, also take some of what I say with a grain of salt, I'm very much a consumer of death metal rather than a producer ;)
p2984
aVThanks for your kind words! So far everyone's criticism has been about the same...they like the song but the mix is mediocre. I will have to work on that.\u000aAs for my tone, I have a fucking hard time trying to find the right one. In this [riff video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQE65Z1yJxo) people were complaining that there was too MUCH gain/treble. Gotta find the right balance.\u000a\u000aI'm glad to hear that an avid death metal fan would listen to this if it were professionally produced. We will be there one day...you should subscribe/like/follow or whatever so you don't forget about us!! Thanks for listening.

VThis happened to me with black metal, but then I kind of "forced" myself to listen until it didn't bother me anymore. You'll get over it, eventually.
p3028
aV+1 for this, its just a matter of getting used to and sometimes when you are used to older production you just cant listen to the modern one because it lacks the soul
p3029
aVYou nailed it on the point too, I mean with newer bands I expect a lot more quality wise. But when it comes to older stuff quality doesn't really matter. And that's pretty much the whole reason people can't get into BM or OSDM, because once people hear the production quality they automatically get turned off. Not all music has to be good or bad just because of its production quality. And IMO, if you can listen past that and still like that person/band you get respect.

Years later my buddy gifted me an album and told me I "needed to hear it" because of how "ridiculous" it was. That album was None So Vile by Cryptopsy. At first I agreed. How was this even music? I mean, those vocals....wtf is that shit? But hey, wait, that drumming is really good, let's keep listening.....hmmm....so is the guitar work.....and the bass.....just ignore the vocals.....ignore the vocals......ignore the voc-actually, now that I'm 4 or 5 listens in to the album the vocals kind of make sense.....few more go rounds and now the vocals are actually kind of cool.....etc\u000a\u000aYears later I am still a diehard dm fan.

aVI was introduced to Six Feet Under in college and really dug it, but I made a lifelong friend at a party that introduced me to Dying Fetus. I soon began listening to anything and everything death metal. 
p3078
aVIt was a slow progression.  As a teen in the mid-1990s, I got into popular rock music which was then grunge followed by crappy nu-metal bands.  I wanted heavier and faster! I started listening to Slayer. By 2000, I started listening to black metal like Emperor and Darkthrone.  Because I was already listening to extreme metal, I decided to give death metal a try.  I had always known about bands like Cannibal Corpse through the media, but they were inaccessible to me before my black metal phase.\u000a\u000aI bought Tomb of the Mutilated in probably 2001, and the rest is history.\u000a\u000aBy the way, OP, have you listened to War Master from Houston? You'd probably like it.
p3079
aVHeh. I was the same with the nu metal shit (korn, slipknot, etc) but then moved on to Opeth, somehow got a hold of Nocturnus (The Key), and the Jester Race.
p3080
aVNu-metal was just everywhere at that time.  Before we all had the internet and the internet was even mature enough to allow us to research stuff online, it was natural.  Kids today don't realize how easy they have it when it comes to finding good music.  The Jester Race was also big in my transition to real metal.  Cheers.

After reading the lyrics I just HAD to listen to the songs. Once I did I was instantly hooked.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt certainly has decided the sound of the DM I like. I lean more towards the Cannibal Corpse sound and instantly like everything that sounds like them. 
p3088
aVby the looks of it, im a bit older than most of you replying. reign in blood came out while i was in the 9th grade. thrash (slayer, sadus, kreator, etc) lead directly to death metal. the first wave of death bands came out late high school for me.

My parents frequented Pantera, Sepultura, Cannibal Corpse and Metallica when I was little and it just stuck with me. The real path to more extreme stuff that my parents wouldn't listen to began when I was about 11 and really liked Slipknot, which led to Rammstein, which led to Carcass which led to everything else afterwards.
p3093
aVYour parents listened to cannibal corpse but nu metal was too extreme?
p3094
aVI'm talking about "kvlt" stuff, or heavier dm . They listened to Slipknot too, I was just saying that was where I really started on my path to what I listen to now.
p3095
aVI was touring w a little bullshit punk rock gig and played a number of shows with the Gentleman homicide. Mathy, grindy, technical and aggressive as fuck on stage. Fuck that they were a Christian band, that's incidental, we all were at that age. Before that I thought metal was only as heavy as mudvayne and local shit so my world was blown. 
p3096
aVI got into metal about 12 years ago because of Symphony X, then got into other prog and power bands. Listened to Opeth, got into Mastodon, etc. I nthink my first actual death metal band was Amon Amarth... who really aren't that death metal when you analyze them in comparison with death metal and power metal bands, haha. Then from Amon Amarth I got into really techy wank, Gorod, Necrophagist, etc, then brutal, like Suffocation, now my favorite is the "occult death metal" or "caverncore" stuff like Antediluvian or Portal.
p3097
aVPortal is probably the most evil thing I have ever heard.
p3098
aVThe Body's ep "Master, We Perish" is pretty evil sounding. Its sludge/doom, though.
p3099
aVCannibal Corpse. All of it, I guess. I had just gotten into Napster and was trying out something different that I heard an older guy at school talk about, I think Mummified in Barbed Wire was the first track I downloaded, just kinda got out of control after that.
p3100
aVIt's a cross between the song Hell March from Red Alert and the soundtrack to The Matrix. There wasn't any death metal on it, but it got me into Marilyn Manson and Rammstein, and that started my downward spiral into the grimdark realm of swords and blood that we know as death metal.
p3101
aVCannibal Corpse kind of got me into it, I mean I was sort of listening to it off and on for quite a few years. But then I found Deicide and that got me hooked big time
p3102
aV  I was into stuff like Slipknot, Lamb Of God, Killswitch Engage etc then I some how ended up downloading No Warning Shot from Six Feet Under and A Skull Full Of Maggots from Corpse and really dug the sound. \u000a  A few weeks later I picked up a sampler from Relapse Records cause I liked the cover art and the band names and was introduced to Dying Fetus, Suffocation, Origin, Cephalic Carnage, Regurgitate and a ton of others and I've been all about death metal ever since 
p3103
aVFor me it was Obituary's The End Complete back in 93. Before that the heaviest thing I had listened to was Seasons in the Abyss.  
p3104
aV[deleted]
p3105
aVDismember- Override the Overture. Well, "Like an Everflowing Stream" in general.\u000a\u000aI was probably about 14, at the time I was really into the some of the old HydraHead bands (Coalesce, Botch, Drowningman, and Neurosis). I was at the music store in the mall, and was sifting through the "used" bin. I found "Like an Everflowing Stream," thought it looked rad, bought it, and it changed my life. Was literally a trap door directly into the death metal, and I was hooked.
p3106
aVAs far back as I can remember (when I was about 5 or 6) I listened to Slayer and Cannibal Corpse. When the internet took off, my death metal palate exploded and there's been no going back.
p3107
aVThe fast tempo chuggy bass and guitar, first time I heard it I was like: **WTF?! This sounds fucking SICK** And I started playing Death Metal on my guitar, and started loving Pig Squeeling/Growling eventually, which I want to do myself now actually.
p3108
aVI worked my way up from panthera to death 
p3109
aVMy buddy found this weird band called Dying Fetus on Spotify, and we listened to it as a joke. I actually liked it and now am addicted to it. 
p3110
aVI was into punk rock and wanted to get into metal, so I asked a friend for some recommendations. He gave me cassettes of "Individual Thought Patterns" and "Seven Churches". My first car only had a cassette player, and those were my only two tapes, so I spent the next year just alternating between those two on my commute to work. It all went downhill from there.
p3111
aVIn Flames "Colony" was the first DM record I really got into, which was a good intro for someone who already liked melodic guitar stuff like Blind Guardian and so forth.  I wish they still actually played death metal... or even like... anything worth listening to.
p3112
aVI kinda like them up to A Sense Of Purpose. Didn't even listen to the last album.
p3113
aVA few of my early favorite albums were Bloodbath - Nightmares Made Flesh, Amon Amarth - Fate of Norns, Hate Eternal - I Monarch, and Nile - Annihilation of the wicked. Before that i was more into bands like Lamb of God, Mastodon, Unearth and Slipknot but after discovering death metal i was hooked
p3114
aVEntombed - Left Hand Path.\u000a\u000aAlways liked metal, don't know what made me pick this CD up one day, but I've been hooked ever since.
p3115
aVBolt Thrower - Shreds of Sanity\u000a\u000aWarmaster is still my favorite Bolt Thrower record. 
p3116
aVMake them suffer by Cannibal Corpse\u000a\u000aBefore I started listening to death/black/thrash metal i listened to metalcore like AILD and Killswitch. Any death metal I heard like Hammer Smashed Face I didn't like the vocals. They just seemed to low in the mix and inaudible. Then I started to listen to Amon Amarth and I warmed up to growling. Then I gave more death metal a try and Make Them Suffer really sold it for me. It was just such straightforward brutality and I'd never heard anything like it. Then I started listening to bands like Deicide, Morbid Angel, Opeth and Carcass.
p3117
aVThy Art Is Murder was the first deathmetal band I ever actualy was a fan of
p3118
aVI always loved good fast metal, but when I heard Eaten Back to Life...I was hooked.
p3119
aVWhen I was in 8th grade I was at HMV or some shit like that when I saw Vile, I'd heard other metal bands but they were metalcore- nu metal type shit so this was completely new and life changing, I played the CD on repeat for a month. \u000a\u000aThis completely broadened my spectrum I really got in Dying Fetus shortly after as well as Bloodbath, Morbid Angel, Skinless.

p3166
aVThey are great. Its an acquired taste but I like how their goal is to create an atmosphere with their music. 
p3167
aVits not really an acquired taste. maybe before they broke through to the other side and it was only australians who knew of them. now they have fancy expensive videos and decent production and label backing and magazines and and - the appeal is clear as day, Dark image shrouded in mystery with blastbeats.
p3168
aVThere is much more to Portal than just a dark mysterious image. The music is quite unique. Their use of dissonance and abrupt tempo changes is impeccable. They also draw influence from 1920's silent films. Their lyrics have their own lore. I don't think you give them enough credit. So what they got fancy videos and better production, they are still doing what they've always done. Maybe I do enjoy the older stuff better but Vexovoid wasn't bad at all.

p3316
aVModern grindcore certainly counts as metal but early grindcore was very firmly punk. My guess is that the shift towards growls in metal occured right around the time grindcore started to hop the fence.
p3317
aVgrindcore is not metal. it is closer to punk. in my opinon. 
p3318
aVHow do you figure?\u000a\u000aBTW, I'm not being an ass. I'm genuinely curious.
p3319
aVhonestly... its just the way it is. grindcore evolved from punk bands. hardcore punk with the dbeat got faster and faster until the skank beat was more common due to the speed. look at napalm death, among the first grindcore bands. their early efforts like scum are essentially fast distorted punk. 2 and 4 chord songs played to fast punk beats. thats grindcore. sure these days its so mixed up theres a lot of metallic influence undoubtedly. but it was born from punk. dunno why i was downvoted to be honest.
p3320

p3345
(lp3346
VHe's got Krisiun and Brutality on the list but no Suffocation? That's like putting the Monkees on a list instead of the Beatles. Also - no Deicide. 
p3347
aVI'm not a big fan of the New York/New Jersey scene, outside of Immolation (and Winter, but that's Death Doom), but I did enjoy the last Suffocation album. As well, Deicide's "Legion" is right outside of the Top 30 for me. I probably should note that the majority of the time, i'm not big on the bands who blast beat their way through most of their songs. I like things a little weirder, if I can get them.
p3348
aVThere's a lot of more recent metal that I enjoy better than the 90s stuff. This list doesn't do much for me.
p3349
aVcompletely disagree with most of the list. Unquestionable Presence best death metal album ever?? you've gotta be shitting me. I realize this is all opinion but for an old school death metal list, i strongly disagree. No Symphonies of Sickness, No Deicide, No early Cannibal Corpse, No Pestilence, No Blessed are the Sick, No Suffocation, Warmaster was the best Bolt Thrower album, No Incantation, No early Malevolent Creation, No Terrorizer, No early Obituary, No Sinister, Leprosy and Spiritual Healing didnt make the list?  theres a lot of newer albums/bands i could name but was sticking with the OSDM theme. good grief. no.
p3350
aVYou are just all sorts of worked up, huh? I do like that I started the thread with "*This is, however, just my opinion. The main link also provides samples from each album. What are some of everyone else's favorites? Old School, Modern, etc.*" and instead of going "Well, I like [insert bands/albums here]" you just go on a douchey tirade about how our tastes don't match. Constructive contributions to a forum conversation? It's a thing that can be done.
p3351
aVwasn't worked up at all. sadly for you, your post being a humanitarian didn't wind up staying at the top so that's not what i read first. you actually started the thread posting a list of picks of half these bands worst albums, putting an Atheist album as best death metal album of all time. sorry i didn't hold your hand through it. i conceded that it was all opinion. my "douchey tirade" hadn't begun til now. did you not expect some criticism for omitting Deicide's first album? or Effigy of the Forgotten? Slowly We Rot? The Bleeding? heres some constructive advice for your list.. explain your perspective on why, for example, Clandestine is ranked higher on your list than Left Hand Path. Or why a long-past-their-prime Bolt Thrower album is ranked at #2 while The Erosion of Sanity sits at #27. the list doesn't make sense to me. if you wanted me to just name off some of my old school favorites, i pretty much did. i dunno why you're so offended.
p3352
aVHeh, e-fighting. Come on now.
p3353
aVim not mad. wasn't trying to sound like an asshole. like i said, i just disagree.
p3354
aVI strongly aprove of "Unquestionable Presence" being at the top. I can't wait for the new album. Kelly Shaefer said it will be to Jupiter what UP was to POT.
p3355
aVIf that's an actual possibility for them, then I wholeheartedly look forward to it. I mean, I am anyways... unless it's Elements II.
p3356
aVWell I loooove Elements just as well (it's honestly my favorite Atheist album) so I wouldn't mind the new album album having similar, dare I say, elements to it. Atheist has thus far been successful in recording albums that are all clearly distinguishable from each other. I have reason to believe this album will be just as unique since it will be the first time Tony Choy will be writing an album with Steve Flynn. I just hope they can convince Rand Burkey to at least record something on the album even if he doesn't tour with the band.
p3357
aVI'm not going to give any crap for someone liking 'Elements'. I kind of look at it the same way a lot of people seem to like the second Nocturnus album, 'Thresholds', and I can't stand it. In both cases, it was a severe departure for me and I just couldn't get into the change, but 'Elements' is far from the worst thing in the world. It is, after all, still Atheist.
p3358
aVI get that many fans of Atheist and death metal in general don't like Elements because of its departure from the genre. As much as I love death metal, I get sick of it pretty easily and that doesn't happen with any of Atheist's albums, especially Elements. For me personally, Elements has by far the most replay value of any death metal band because it isn't a death metal album. There is at least as much jazz and other progressive aspects of it as there are metal (in my opinion, more so than the metal parts) and that's precisely why I love it.
p3359
aVEveryone has an opinion and I respect their taste in music but Atheist at #1?  Two Bolt Thrower albums in the top ten?  Death way down at #25??? \u000aWhat about Morbid Angel - Blessed are the Sick, Death - Leprosy, At the Gates - Slaughter of the Soul, Obituary - Cause of Death, Dismember - Like an Everflowing Stream, and especially Possessed - Seven Churches?\u000aOh hell who am I kidding?  I love your list too but these are definitely some you should consider. \u005cm/ \u005cm/
p3360
aVDismember is actually one of the more recent additions to the 'like' side of my Death Metal portfolio, so i'm slowly picking up steam with them. I'm not fond of any Morbid Angel past Altars really (Covenant is alright), I've never been into At The Gates (Yes, I know) and Obituary are starting to grow on me, but those vocals were hard to adjust to lol. I'm also yet to bring myself to listen to Possessed, but I do like most of what Death has to offer, it's just not all that high for me.
p3361
aVAppropriately stunned by your At the Gates admission.  :)  Being an older metalhead, Possessed is kind of a must to me, but honestly it's more for it's groundbreaking and historical value than anything.  Death, also, was so groundbreaking during their time.  The thing that makes them stand out to me is the way they evolved over a very short time.  Each album sounding tighter and different.  But to each his own!  Enjoyed your list.  Thanks for taking the time.
p3362
aVI understand the importance of ATG, but it just never clicked with me. With some of them moving forward, I also didn't click with The Haunted, but more people seem to be on board with that opinion it seems. I do own "Terminal Spirit Disease" though and find it to be alright, I think I just heard "Slaughter of the Soul" too late after being told by too many people how amazing it was, so it was pre-ruined for me. Despite my lack of Death on the list outside of Human, I do have and enjoy all of their albums (And "Scream Bloody Gore" is a downright classic and I feel kind of jerkish for having it outside of my Top 30). Possessed i'm sure i'll get to at some point. Another album right on the outside of this list (Although not technically Death Metal) has to be Repulsion's "Horrified". I felt that of the classic 'Grindcore' albums, they were the ones who did it the best. "Scum" is alright, but that first Carcass album in that vein is crap.
p3363
aVNo Deicide, Death is at #25 (not to mention you chose Human over Leprosy or Spiritual Healing), and last but not least...NO SEVEN CHURCHES?! Nope.
p3364
aVIt's a good thing I didn't already explain all of those things or anything. You'll live.

aVI get it, I get it. A completely self-serving list of your (shit) opinions. 
p3366
aVIs it bad i only have one of these albums
p3367
aVSounds about right to me.  I, too, only own one of them and it barely snuck on the list near the end.  Even that one is far from mandatory.
p3368
aVProbably. Fix it.
p3369
aVThis is, however, just my opinion. The main link also provides samples from each album. What are some of everyone else's favorites? Old School, Modern, etc. 
p3370
aVCarcass' Heartwork for sure, Opeth's Blackwater Park, and The Black Dahlia Murder's Ritual are some of my favorites.
p3371
aVWhile we're all entitled to our opinions, this list is pretty narrow in focus.  I think anybody would agree Blackwater Park not only makes the list, but goes pretty damn high on it, and quite frankly, embarrasses a lot of what's on the list.

aVI haven't seen too much discussion of it going on in /r/technicaldeathmetal, which is a shame. It deserves its own thread because it's fucking awesome. \u000a\u000aI really dig how melodic it is while still retaining brutality. It's kind of rare to see that in up and coming bands these days. \u000a\u000aI also really dig how well they blend their symphonic / choir elements into their music because, imo, that can easily be overdone and kill the mood for me. \u000a\u000aAll in all, fantastic album. Each track is unique, heavy as hell, and with gorgeous melodies. Solid 9/10 in my book. 
p3403
aVIt was posted there pretty much the day it came out.  It's where I first heard of Inferi on their first album.  It's just kind of old news over there.
p3404
aVTotally agreed. It's such an awesome experience when you can listen to an album and know for a fact that a SHIT ton of time went into making it. I'm on the same page with the symphonic/choir elements. The latin choir in "Destroyer" really took me by surprise, pleasantly.
p3405
aVFuck yea man. I discovered them a long ass time ago on MySpace. My mind was blown when this album released. It doesn't get old 
p3406
aVMe too! Bless Myspace. I was living in North Alabama at the time and was cruising for bands from the area (they're from Nashville) and I found Inferi. "End of an Era" is so fucking metal, too. 
p3407
aVI don't know if it's YouTube's compression, but the guitars sound so flat/without chunkiness. In solos *and* riffs.\u000a\u000aEDIT: It's better in "The Ophidian Form", but still...
p3408
aVIt's just YouTube. I have the vinyl for this and it is gorgeously produced. CD sounds good as well, not overly loud and very dynamic.
p3409
aVSeconded. I was fortunate enough to snag one of the limited signed pressings and it does sound incredible. I fucking love that "Vessels, beyond the reach of time..." breakdown thing. It sounds so good on vinyl. Youtube or mp3 doesn't do that part's depth and dynamism justice.\u000a\u000aOnly thing that sucks about the limited pressing is that there are 4 fucking sides of music over 2 records, so each side only has like 2-3 songs on it. The regular pressing has a solid 30 mins of music on each side before it needs to be flipped, which I envy.
p3410
aVIm in the same boat as you but I don't mind that much. The vinyl should last forever, isn't it 200g?
p3411
aVA vinyl of the gods. Yes, it's definitely a very substantial record, and I don't regret the decision to get the special edition at all, it's a beautiful record, both in content and aesthetics, but I love just being able to chill out and listen for a while before flipping. I really shouldn't bitch though. I just got Deflorate by TBDM on vinyl and the whole album all the way through is just over 30 mins, so even one of the two Inferi records is about the same length. It's pretty rare to find an hour long metal album that is full of great tracks.\u000a\u000aAs amazing as it is, I think my audio setup is holding the album's sound potential back. I'm using [this](http://www.amazon.com/Jensen-3-Speed-Stereo-Turntable-Silver/dp/B000UVKE2I/ref=sr_sp-atf_image_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407091004&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=record+player&amp;dpPl=1) hooked up to [this](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-HW-F450-Channel-280-Watt-Soundbar/dp/B00BLX9510/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409028995&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=samsung+wireless+sound+bar). \u000a\u000aWhat kind of setup are you using?
p3412
aVIt may be a little bit of both. Guitar work that's generally higher tuned or played in higher keys probably has a lower necessary threshold for chunky guitar tone. It was probably engineered with more mid and high end treble because that kind of tone better fits Inferi's style. Also, Youtube's compression is fucking awful, a lot of the time.

Relentlessness is also lovely.\u000a\u000aVital Remains - Icons of Evil.\u000a\u000aDeicide - Til Death Do Us Part\u000a\u000aCannibal Corpse - Butchered at Birth\u000a\u000a\u000athat kind of thing\u000a
p3508
aVEdit: I really don't know where I was going with this. This is why I should avoid reddit when I'm really tired; I tend to make a tragic ass of myself. I guess i interpreted the question as asking what we like about this music and what distinguishes artists from one another when to most people it all sounds like the same old noise and screaming. But that's not the case, so... Take it away, past me.\u000a\u000aI take it you aren't a Death Metal person and it all sounds the same to you. \u000a\u000aYeah, it can be how the singer sings, the guitarist plays, having a sick drummer. It can be catchy lyrics or badass riffs or pretty interludes. It can be anything that makes them sound unique that appeals to the listener. Because it's music. Weird, extreme, violent, abrasive music, yes, but it's music. So all the same reasons people like music in other genres could apply. \u000a\u000aI like the growl Chris Barnes had on the early Cannibal Corpse albums and I like them partly because of that, but that's not a Death Metal specific thing. I also like Elton John because of how he sings. I like the riffs and the way Jimmy Page plays in Led Zeppelin. But I also like the way John Gallagher plays in Dying Fetus. Buddy Rich was a super talented Swing drummer and I like listening to his speed and prowess, much the same way I do George Kollias from Nile.\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, there's stuff in the genre of Death Metal as a whole that draw people to it and could be generally described as the hallmarks of a good Death Metal band. First and foremost, I think, is heaviness. Its such a hard concept to describe- the impact, the almost physical moving force of the music. Another is the dark atmosphere: minor tonalities, foreboding or aggressive sounding melodies. Technicality- a big draw can definitely be just basking in awe of the prowess of the musicians, be it apparent in the form of great songwriting, raw speed, or what have you. \u000a\u000aIt's a very open genre in a lot of ways, though, so it's hard to come up with too comprehensive a list of qualities that define a good Death Metal band without excluding bands, albums, and songs that are very much still Death Metal. You could argue it's fast, but then what about Suffocation? The Cannibal Corpse song Festering in the Crypt? You could argue that it should always have harsh vocals, but what about Augury or Obscura, who frequently use clean singing? \u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Things that make a musical artist that someone likes aren't necessarily unique to Death Metal, although the Genre has some broader defining qualities that make a band a good Death Metal band in most people's eyes. Also I misunderstood the question.\u000a

aVwhat i meant was what makes you like a certain band. for me its vocalist
p3512
aVDying Fetus - Fast pace drums, creativity, grotesque vocals, shredding guitar, and agression, point of views in lyrics
p3513
aVI guess I'm pretty old-fashioned in my taste. When listening to a new band and the singer sounds like a squashed frog then I'd immediately stop listening. Among my favourite vocals are those from Jörgen Sandström/Grave, Matti Kärki/Dismember or Chris Reifert/Autopsy so go figure.\u000a\u000aI prefer guitars rather be not too technical, but still very fast. Typical Thrash/Death riffs with fast pickings and schredding. Drums are fine with blast beasts (as long as they're not sounding like a sewing machine) but I'm also perfectly fine with just fast Thrash drumming. Such dead simple drums like on Death "Leprosy" album are gold, I'm not looking for all the crazy drum fills and what not.\u000a\u000aFor me the production is important too. I'm not too keen on clean and polished recordings, but rather enjoy the rawer kind of things. When there are real drums on a recording, I'd like them to sound like real drums too. There's no point in triggering ALL THE THINGS because then you could just fire the drummer and use programmed drums instead.
p3514
aVHow the Drums mix with the Guitar. Good vocals are a bonus. Only certain songs stick on certain bands.

aVLots of good albums mentioned. I know it's been circle jerked to death now, but Behemoth's the satanist is a fantastic album, and for me, it lived up to the hype that surrounded it before release. I didn't see it mentioned so I thought I'd throw it in there. Additionally, black crown initiated debut album is very good, and I hope to hear more from them., and misery index's new one was killer. Another couple of good ones I haven't seen mentions yet are Human Infection's curvatures in time (Osdm) as well as tyranny enthroned' our great undoing.

p3539
aVYep, I always saw them as a more technical version of TBDM. Did you see them with Chelsea Grin, SS and TBDM? They put on an amazing performance, but I had to suffer through Chelsea Grin and SS to get to TBDM -___-
p3540
aVI got lucky and only saw Chelsea Grin. TBDM played and I left before SS could even sound check, haha. TDBM put on a fucking great show.
p3541
aVI guess since TBDM and SS were co-headlining, they switch up who goes last. When I saw that tour in Detroit, I had to sit through SS to wait for TBDM, but the pit was absolutely insane so it was worth it.
p3542
aVHell yeah. Some awesome pits for sure. I only watched this time around cause I saw Suffocation and Jungle Rot 2 days earlier and was sore as hell, and I had school the next day. So glad there's new shit that still sounds good. These guys know what the hell they're doing.

aVI'm not, no. The bass player is my best friend, though! \u000a\u000aWe're pressing the EP ('Polar Vortex') on clear vinyl with blue smoke, so it will look icy. There will be no centre labels, but the b-side will be screen printed with six swords (Six of Swords, get it?) meeting at the middle and possibly the band's logo. Since the vinyl will be translucent and lacking centre labels, you'll be able to see the b-side printed art while the record plays.

p3583
aVHmm, I can definitely see why this wouldn't appeal to others. The riffs aren't exactly revolutionary and the vocals are pretty "goofy" compared to most death metal bands. I like these guys though. Their sound is chunky and would make a great soundtrack to a cheesy B-horror movie.

aVFrom some of the bands you listed it looks as though you have a taste for a darker sounding Death Metal. Thats good, cuz so do I.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Abysmal Dawn - From Ashes](http://youtube.com/watch?v=yMPxwIAIHWI) - a local band from the Los Angeles area with a darkened sound. Nothing really stands out about them but this album just has an intangibable touch.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Azarath - Diabolic Impious Evil](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ksflUG98N-o) - I swear by this band and this album. Azarth shares a drummer with Behemoth (Inferno) which is how I learned of them. The lyrics are cheesy but I think the music speaks for itself. I look at this band as a somewhat stripped down version of Behemoth, and I think they pull it off flawlessly.\u000a\u000a\u000a[Dissincarnate -Dreams of A Carrion Kind](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ADoQyFyOtd4) - Dissincarnate has a kind of cult status about them. They released only one album (early to mid 90s I think)... and what a shame when you listen to it. I'd liken it to Incantation and the early 90s Death Metal sound. Something Dead Congregation makes me think of.\u000a\u000a\u000acheers

p3640
asVWhat Do You Think Is The Most Overused Technique In DM?
p3641
(lp3642
VNot necessarily a technique, but down-tuning as low as possible. Now everyone tunes down to drop a to try and sound heavier. Hell, back in the day Cannibal Corpse tuned to e flat and sounded heavier than most of these bands tuned in a. It's seems like a cheap way to try and sound heavier.
p3643
aVYou've got a point, but at the same time I would consider it more of like the standard for Death Metal, with a seven string, A# tuning is a very versatile tuning. Plus there are bands who tune even lower than that and barely use the versatility that it offers.\u000a
p3644
aVThat's true, there's nothing writing with the tuning itself. I was thinking more about how bands tend to only chug on the bottom 2 strings and stay within the bottom 5 frets. So I shouldn't have said the problem is the tuning, but the way they use it.
p3645
aVThat I'll agree with. If you're going to seven string, use the other damn strings haha
p3646
aVAlso Eaten Back to Life was just a great album, CC did a great job their first three albums.\u000a
p3647
aVSpeed\u000a\u000aBecause obviously Faster==Heavier
p3648
aVYeah, slower death metal tends to have a nice sound to it, like Festering In The Crypt, or Sun Of Nihility
p3649
aVI mean, don't get me wrong, I love fast shit, but I think the art of contrast is somewhat forgotten these days.\u000a\u000aIf you play something slow, something faster will stick out more, and vice versa. If all you're doing is going fast (or slow) all day, it kinda loses some of it's effect.
p3650
aVTech wank. 
p3651
aVCrazy tempo changes just for the sake of being technical. Drives me nuts.
p3652
aVIn my opinion I think the whole usage of tremolo in chorus is too overused (myself guilty of doing this)
p3653
aVBlast beats are one of the things that define DM.\u000a\u000aAs far as overused goes, I'd agree with the guy that said tech wank.
p3654
aVFucking sweep arpeggios man. Tech death is so gay for sweep arpeggios.

aVBloodbath has a good set of deep vocals. 'Nightmares Created Flesh' has Hypocrisy front-man Peter on vocals, while everything else is Mikael Akerfeldt from Opeth, who has a legendary deep growl while maintaining pronunciation.\u000a\u000aMy personal favorites are the EP 'Breeding Death', full-length, 'Resurrection Through Carnage', and the later EP, ' Unblessing The Purity'. The Fathomless Mastery sounds an awful lot like later Morbid Angel and has some catchy/ominous stuff!

aVI just listened to Pierced From Within on my drive to work, ended up taking the long way just so I could hear more.\u000a\u000aIt's fucking perfect! Bass that I can hear, wild guitars, great drumming that has oomph to it, and deep vocals that I can still understand without a lyric sheet for every word. I'm almost scared to listen to any of their other albums because I'm afraid they won't be as great as this one!\u000a\u000a

aVWell I did have plans for tonight when I get off but that's changing rapidly.\u000a\u000aIt's rare that an album makes me go "Holy shit this is good!" for every song. And if the rest of their discography is at least almost as good as this, my week is off to a good start!

aVwell you seem like a real intelligent fella.  Really got a grasp on the whole "taste is subjective" concept.  My point was, the Incubus that featured Mike Browning and predates this band, was better. Give them a listen if you haven't.  "anyone claiming to be into death metal" should enjoy it
p4050
aVI wasn't attacking you,  but thanks.\u000aOf course I know about Mike Brownings time in the band, I still prefer this album, but I don't see how I was supposed to surmise "your point" from your one vague comment saying they suck.\u000a\u000a\u000aI just joined this sub to share and enjoy death metal with others but I see now its just another toxic reddit community.
p4051
aVMike Browning  was actually in a different death metal band called incubus. I was saying it was a better band than this one, which I always felt was uninspired and over produced. You need to grow some thicker skin. You shouldn't fly off the handle every time someone expresses a conflicting view point.

aVyeah man, i love that old school growling. Tardy/Van Drunen were my absolute faves back in the day. 
p4073
aVWhat do you think of Pestilence's Patrick on vocals? I think did a good job after Van Drunen stepped back.  
p4074
aVhonestly, i never did get into Testimony of the Ancients (or any of their newer stuff recently) because i was so let down that Van Drunen wasn't in the band anymore. i dont care for Mameli's vocals at all. Consuming Impulse was such a great album then meh. pretty disappointing. at least i got to see them for that tour before Van Drunen split.\u000a\u000aedit: Mameli's vocals would have been fine in another band but i loved the first 2 albums so much at the time then the change was too drastic imo. Van Drunen was perfect for their sound at the time.
p4075
aVI hear ya. I like all of Pestilence, all vocals, the weird progressive approach they went on after Van Drunen (Testimony' is like a death metal Rush at some points. Hahah!), and the strange guitar riffs.\u000a\u000aVan Drunen had the 'being disembowled at the microphone' scream, and Patrick's are like 'ooze'\u000a\u000aI'm a pretty open listener.

aVCannibal Corpse is one of my favourite bands. They consistently produce brutal, riffy, catchy, no-frills death metal. They don't reinvent the wheel, but they don't need to. If you go into a CC record expecting Artificial Brain, you're gonna be disappointed, sure. But after you've listened to band after band try and fail to be 'interesting' by shoehorning in influences that don't quite work or gimmicky instrumentation or whatever, it's nice to know that Cannibal Corpse will always be there putting out great (if not revolutionary) music.

p4241
aVThoughts?
p4242
aVDefinitively an amazing read. \u000aIt was a bit dated, as we all know that Metal is an ever evolving genre composed of an infinite number of subgenres.\u000a\u000aSome very slight errors here and there that were accurate at the time the book was published.  \u000a\u000aAs far as breaking down the history. It's incredible.\u000a  \u000aI would recommend reading Black Metal: Evolution of a cult.
p4243
aVChoosing Death isn't bad, but it focuses almost exclusively on a specific handful of bands/musicians and I think it gives a very limited view of what was happening in the underground at that time, and also really skims over the development of the sound (I have not read the expanded edition)\u000a\u000aFor a much wider look at the development of death metal I highly recommend Jason Netherton's collection of interviews Extremity Retained.

p4335
aVIf you like Monolith you'll like the one before it, The Harvest Floor.  Great stuff.
p4336
aVI didn't get into them until I saw them live. They're fuckin great to watch. 
p4337
aVI'm going to have to agree with you on this. I use to not really care for them. Thought the production and drums on "Karma Bloody Karma" were shit. All changed when I saw them live for the first time. Summer Slaughter 2007. Holy fuck. Amazing band. Love them now. 
p4338
aVNothing worse than fucked production affecting drums, Deicide suffered from this numerous times.  \u000a\u000aThe next big mistake is overbearing vocals.

p4341
aVI always liked their more well known songs like success..(is hanging by the neck, testicular manslaughter, and so on. The Harvest Floor is what really got me into them, and when Monolith dropped my head exploded.
p4342
aV I started out with Monolith of inhumaity, I fell in love with them. my favorite tracks are kingdoms of tyrants and lifestalker and of course the whole fucking album.\u000a The harvest floor is pretty good album. I like " Into the public bath" it's so vicious, love this chorus;\u000a  "We walk through shallows of shit\u000aWe're wading in it\u000aUrea, mucus and human jit\u000aWe love the taste of it..." \u000a Karma, Bloody, Karma brutal as fuck, its unrelenting. I dig "Alone at the landfill"  I feel like when I listen to it I am soaring in hell. ( as corny as that sounds) But the jem for me is "The new dawn" that song has one of the best guitar riffs I have ever heard. \u000a All there earlier shit is ok check that out too.\u000a

aVI always hated tech death but I can understand why people like it. I mostly like it simple and groovy. Guy before me commented that Dying Fetus is tech and if it is I gues I like some of it too because Reign Supreme is fucking awesome.
p4374
aVI always considered dying fetus a technical band but I would not consider them tech death. They definately fall under the brutal death subgenre. 
p4375
aVhttp://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Dying_Fetus/45 Says here it's tech death but they have a bit of both.

aVMy nigga. Dying Fetus man, so fucking awesome 
p4377
aVmelodeath,  I find in most metal genres a tinge of melody really helps drive the emotion of the song (like Amon Amarth, the melodic side pushes the heroic invigorating).\u000a\u000aAlso blackened death and progressive wank metal
p4378
aVI like some melodeath like Amon Amarth, Insomnium, Illdisposed, In Flames, Soilwork and so on. Older melodeath is nice aswell.
p4379
aVI want riffs.\u000a\u000aI want a groove that makes me stop what I'm doing just to bang my head.\u000a\u000aI want dynamics...and by dynamics, I do not mean a loud part, a quiet part, a loud part.  Actual dynamics.\u000a\u000aI want musicianship.\u000a\u000aI want guitar solos.\u000a\u000aI want it recorded well enough that I can turn it all the way up.
p4380
aVI'm in the same boat, and I'd add that if there are vocals, I'd like to be able to *barely* understand them, but understand them indeed -- and have the lyrics be truly brutal.

aVPolish death metal - vox, lyrical approach, blazing sound\u000aDecapitated\u000aVader\u000aHate\u000aBehemoth
p4386
aVI was gonna say Krypts and Corpsessed. Ultra sludgy, gross, non-technical. \u000a\u000aI also like a lot of newer death that blends with Black metal. I guess some call it "Atmospheric Death"? Examples would be the new Diocletian record, Zom, Pseudogod, Paroxsihzem, Ritual Necromancy, and Begrime Exemious.
p4387
aVI would just call them black/death or war metal (at least Diocletian) but i guess that's just me, heh. Great bands nonetheless!  I'm gonna check out Paroxsihzem, cheers!
p4388
aVNew Diocletian is moving away from war metal though. 
p4389
aVI haven't really got my teeth into the new one yet! Sounds interesting! 
p4390
aVCould just be that the production is much more clean, but it's a damn good record!! I had trouble with their other releases because they were so noisy, I couldn't hear the riffs. 
p4391
aVAre you kidding? Doom Cult Is awesome! At least if you like Revenge, Genocide Shrine etc. I'll give it a spin thou!
p4392
aVThere's something I haven't heard anything about. Not a big fan of black metal but I'll be sure to listen to some of those.\u000a\u000aEdit: Listened to Paroxsihzem and Ritual Necromancy for a few seonds and it automatically reminded me of Portal. \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olWih7eajpk
p4393
aVThose all lean towards death metal more than black. Check them out. Very similar to the stuff you like, probably all influenced by Asphyx, Incantation, Grave, etc.\u000a\u000aJust checked out Desecresy. Extremely sick!!
p4394
aVEdited my last comment, give Portal a listen. 
p4395
aVOh yeah, totally! I know Portal, but not well. Probably should listen to them more, because they're probably the main influence for all my favorite bands, haha
p4396
aVall of them, I like them all equally
p4397
aVTechnical and Melodic hands down are my favorite.   
p4398
aVBlackened death absolutely. All the rawness of black metal without the 20 minutes of ambient noise, Teitanblood's Anteinfierno is a great example. The Bolt Thrower sound I love too, that grinding doom. I've never really been into sludgy shit, but that's because it was mostly the drums that got me into death as opposed to the riffs.

aVI have an HDD kit that will allow me to pull from any harddrive as long as the HDD isn't physically crashed into oblivion.  If you are in the States, or can buy a kit on amazon for $30, it is totally worth it.  Also, next time, keep your library backed up on a separate hard drive.

aVDude this has happened to me on more than 3 occasions... Never treat hard drives like they're 'the one'. I make multiple copies of my iTunes library for this very reason. Currently using two 1TB external hard drives and my iTunes library on my iMac. Download the albums to the external and then make sure you have that little checkbox ticked that duplicates your albums from their source and stores them locally. (All of this is assuming you use iTunes but the principle still applies if you don't) Sorry for your loss man!

aVWhy don't you like slayer? Can you at least respect the massive impact that they had on both thrash and death metal?
p4471
aVOh, I absolutely respect their impact!  As a fan of old-school Mayhem, Darkthrone, and the like, Slayer influenced and coalesced those guys like nothing else did.  My issue with Slayer lies in the million-and-one copycats that exist in the -core and formulaic metal scene today, which have ruined my interest in hearing "the original thing".\u000a\u000aI prefer coffee, so I have no interest in buying a super-fancy tea-making machine that brews a hundred cups of tea in a minute, using tea leaves from the southern coast of India that cost $100/lb.  Even further, I have no interest in brewing myself a $0.50 cup of tea in my kitchen.  Doesn't mean I don't appreciate tea, or the infinite advances that have been made in the process of consuming tea.  Does that make sense?

aVWhen predicting the future, it's always difficult to say.\u000a\u000aHowever, if we look at other genres that have emerged in the past, Rock, Blues, Jazz, R'n'B etc. They all have their own following and all are getting bigger. Metal is no exception to this. Hell, even classical music is as popular today as it ever was back in the 18th century.\u000a\u000aWith a growing world population, and the advances in how music is actually played from person to person, there can be no limit as to the possibilites in which music can be made, or how it reaches its fans. Dubstep, an non existent genre a decade ago is currently huge. I can guarantee it will still have a large following in 10 years time (though maybe not hold a huge percentage of the market like now).\u000a\u000aAs for Metal? Well it's certainly evolved from the days of Black Sabbath. And I can see it continuing to evolve. Djent seems to be very popular at the moment, and shows metal has come along way since the 70's, but thats not to say people aren't reviving the old ways in a new light (see The Sword).\u000a\u000aThis evolution can also be seen live (though rarely at the moment) with solo artists swaying away from the traditional 4/5 man band. Drums can now be replaced with a laptop using EZ-drummer, and guitars can go this way too. What we see is something akin to Kraftwerk; several people on stage twiddling knobs instead of aggresively playing their instruments. \u000a\u000aTraditional setups will always have a following however, just the way that Blues has always had a following since the 20's. The people rarely change, but the times do.

p4563
(lp4564
VI really like djent. I also really like Death metal (technical/brutal/melodic/whatever). Both "genres" or "styles" have aspects to them which I enjoy at different times, and I think it will always be silly to call out an entire genre as "not being a genre" or not being good or not being heavy or whatever. \u000a\u000aLike, shit like this just gets me going (as does a lot of death metal). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEAx_5dF7Kg\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also this: http://youtu.be/0gMcTIBiJZo?t=32m30s
p4565
aVIt's all shitty Meshuggah ripoffs imo\u000a\u000aI really don't see much value in it as a genre, both in terms of artistic value and musical enjoyment. At best, it's trendy, bandwagon-y and derivative; at worst, it's straight up ripping off other, better bands.\u000a
p4566
aVK but listen to bands like Animals as Leaders or Periphery, these bands are at the core of the whole "djent" thing, and those bands (in my opinion) are trying to make new interesting music and trying to push the boundary of then genre (more AAL than Periphery but still). That's what djent should be, jazz infused metal with lots of virtuoso elements. Other good bands to mention are The Helix Nebula, and Sithu Aye. Like, it's totally fair to not consider it metal also, but I wouldn't call any of the bands I mentioned "shitty Meshuggah ripoffs" although I can understand your opinion. As in any genre, there are a lot of copy cats trying to piggy back on the sound. 
p4567
aVThis is deathcore all over again. I get that all the dient kiddies can get on your nerves and that there's a lot of BAD copycats. But this ain't nu metal or glam metal. There are no studio execs. These folks are just doing music they like. Is it a fad? I don't think so but I could be wrong. Is it pretentious? Yes. Are they co-opting our music like glam metal and nu metal did? No, not really. Djent is still a pretty small niche within heavy metal.  
p4568
aVI guess we could ask ourselves: What makes a genre? I agree that most Djent bands could also be considered Deathcore, Metalcore or Prog-Metal, but to me Djent has become a genre (or sub-genre) of it's own for the following reasons:\u000aA: Tons of bands are playing it \u000aB: It became somewhat popular in the last few years \u000aC: It delelopped into a scene of it's own\u000a\u000aI also don't really care about Djent, btw
p4569
aVWhat makes a genre? Well, one sound certainly doesn't. 
p4570
aVDeath Metal = Blast beats, frenetic riffing, growled vocals, dark subject matter\u000a\u000aDjent = polyrhythms, jazzy chords, open note grooves, slower riffage, ambient background sounds\u000a\u000aBoth would appear to be genres with characteristics. 
p4571
aVEveryone always says "djent" bands are a ripoff of Meshuggah but when I hear "djent" bands I usually hear little to no Meshuggah. Just breakdowns with weird guitar patterns and lots of open notes 
p4572
aVTrue dat... Supposedly they coined the phrase "Djent" but every djent band I've ever heard just sounded like deathcore... Just more electronics and singing 
p4573
aVOnly things I don't like about it, is that they feel the need to add in electro-garbage half the time, and for whatever reason they make an attempt at singing... \u000a\u000aBut, it's not like there was some official meeting to make Dubstep a genre, or Jazz or even Death Metal. If you have enough people that like a sound, eventually other bands start to copy it, a bigger fan base grows, and eventually it's recognized as its own genre. If they want to use an onomatopoeia as the name for their music, who are we to stop them? If we all did that, I think it'd be pretty entertaining... ie: Deathcore will now be called "Jug Jug Jug Breeeee"
p4574
aVIndeed, but those genres came from something and sound different from what they evolved. Or devolved if you will. It's not the sound, it's a sound. One sound doesn't make a genre. If it wants to be called a genre it should have it's own trademarks, just like death metal has blast beats, growls and lots of tremolo picking.
p4575
aVLet's talk about good music instead.
p4576
aVWith enough bands trying to replicate a certain "sound", you can bet your ass it's a genre. I enjoy a few bands from time to time (Intervals, Cloudkicker), and I love me some Meshuggah, but it's usually pretty repetitive and talentless music.\u000a\u000aEdit: as a drummer, I feel like I appreciate the groove, polyrhythms, and beats a little more than melodies as well..
p4577
aVIt seems rather boring and overdone. Some chug chugs and noodling over them. Although these bands seem to rip off Meshuggah (one of my favorite bands) i think they lack the complexity of material/rythym and boil it down to boring useless songs with horrid vocals. As with some other genres of metal, i am not a fan of this by far, but to each their own. That's what makes metal so great IMO. 
p4578
aVAgreed, whatever floats their boat. It just slightly bothers me that they call it a genre when it's clearly not. 
p4579
aVWhat makes it clearly not a genre though? Personally I can agree with it being more of a "style" that gets tacked on to a genre (Like "djent" Prog metal, Animals as Leaders, The Helix Nebula, Vildhjarta), but there's still a lot of characteristics associated with bands like that and other bands. Like, if you say "djent" there's a lot of bands that come to mind, same as if you were to say "Death Metal", "Power Metal", "Deathcore/Metalcore" etc. 
p4580
aVI'd agree with with this. Like brutal death metal or old school death metal. It can be with some genre but not genre on it's own because it's only one sound.
p4581
aVYea.... i don't get it either.

(lp4617
V[Elemental Nightmares](http://www.elemental-nightmares.com), a vinyl project consisting of 28 exclusive tracks spread out over 7 10" vinyl splits recently released the fifth split. This one features one of the bands that I do vocals for, ([Kaos Vortex](http://www.kaosvortex.com)). We'd love to hear what /r/deathmetal thinks about our track!\u000a\u000aOur split also features some pretty damn good melodic death metal from Eternal Storm (ES). The other side of the split will probably appeal more to those into black metal. Will of the Ancients (CA) have a certain Enslaved-ish feel to them, and Stortregn (CH) play melodic black metal much in the vein of Dissection &amp; Watain.\u000a\u000aThe four previous splits are also up for streaming on [bandcamp here](http://elemental-nightmares.bandcamp.com).\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVYou're probably going to get downvoted because "herp derp bdm not deathmetal and too pop" but i agree with you. Great guys, great music. I listen to my share of bands, but they're always good to come back to.
p4683
aVThank you for agreeing. How is something like that considered pop? Like what factor makes it pop?
p4684
aVthe fact that it's a very popular mainstream band as far as "metal" goes. Headlining Warped Tour, selling their clothes at Hot Topic, etc. But i digress...they have some very technical songs, great compositions, and amazing vocal work IMHO. But at the end of the day, its music. Listen to what you want, for the reasons you want. Don't let other peoples' opinions and biases affect yours.

(lp4709
VDecapitated hasn't felt the same since Nihility.  Which is understandably what happens when you're drummer who is a big part of your sound dies.  Soreption's new album sounds like what Decapitated should sound like.  Decapitated has progressively moved more towards mainstream metal and further from DM.
p4710
aVI like soreptions riffs but the songs are just a few repititions  of the same catchy parts nihility has the best riffs ever but organic hallucinosis for me is the best written and produced album ever. Got any other suggestions? Judging off the early release of the newest decap song they won't be going back to their old ways
p4711
aVTry Deadborn, they are the only band I can think of that *might* have that sound but I feel 'Organic Hallucinosis' is a really unique album, hard to find stuff with the same level of intensity and vocal style. 
p4712
aVThe First Damned is my favorite album by far.  As far as bands that sound like Decpaitated there aren't many.  I listen to mostly tech-death so I would recommend Alterbeast, Archspire, Omnihility, Inferi, Aborted, Wretched.  All have 2014 albums and they're really good.

p4734
(lp4735
VBad ass. Thanks for posting.\u000a\u000aI'm more a new school kinda guy, so cleaner production is more my speed. Necrocracy is the first Exhumed album I listened to, and I loved it. Then I worked my way backwards. When I heard Gore Metal, I really dug the riffs and all the tunes in general, but I was really turned off by the shit production.\u000a\u000aSuper cool to hear those jams in modern quality.
p4736
aVI loved this album around when it came out, Slaughtercult too. I kind of fell off after Anatomy is Destiny, which was awesome as well. Haven't listened to any newer ones.
p4737
aVTheir most recent album Necrocracy is pretty good even though the production is a little polished for my taste. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAdGkD79DEk) is one of the highlights
p4738
aVIt sounds the same as any other Exhumed song. Guess that's why I got tired of them. I'll just stick with the classics.
p4739
aVI was lukewarm on Necrocracy but I really love the previous album "No Guts No Glory". It probably overtakes Slaughtercult as my second favorite. 
p4740
aVI'll check it out.
p4741
aVI'm usually not a fan of this sort of thing, but I'm actually excited about this.\u000a\u000aGore Metal was one of my first extreme albums and a favorite to this day. I've seen them live a couple times in the last few years and hearing songs like "Open the Abscess" with the more speed metal feel and chops of "No Guts..." always reminds me of why I got interested in death metal to begin with. Exhumed is at the top of their game right now and while I'd prefer a new record, this'll do. 
p4742
aVWhat's everyone's favorite track from this album? I'm a big fan of "Blazing Corpse"
p4743
aVCasket Crusher and Limb from Limb are my favorites. Also, Deathmask, Open the Abcess... Fuck, they're all badass! Love this fucking album! Pretty excited about this rerelease, used to listen to Gore Metal daily 15 years ago.

sVWhat did yall think of the latest Suffocation album?
p4754
(lp4755
VThe same as I felt about every Suffocation album starting with Souls: Better than most of its stylistic contemporaries, not even remotely close to the quality of their material in the 90s. They're trying too hard to compete with the younger bands they influenced.
p4756
aVI agree 100% i also thought franks vocals were a but iffy compaired to older albums, i dont know it might be production but it was a pretty album overall, frank has his moments, the guitars were great amd i think this is dave culross' first album with suffocation, correct me if im wrong but the drums i thought were great
p4757
aVYeah he only played on Despise the Sun (an EP). I love his drumming.
p4758
aVit was ok. very suffocationy with some suffocation influences
p4759
aVI've liked every Suffocation album I've heard. Sure, some of their old stuff is a bit better, but that doesn't mean I don't love a bit of Bind Torture Kill. 
p4760
aVNot bad, but I preferred their old groovy style with Mike Smith.  You can tell the band's sound changed dramatically without him.
p4761
aV[deleted]
p4762
aVtheir prime was early to mid-90s when they were pushing the death metal envelope. they're still very good imo but its like Slayer was the last 5 albums. they're not exactly 'phoning it in' but they're basically out of really brilliant ideas and now they're rehashing their own sound. there's worse things to sound like so it's still better than a sea of other bands. also something about the song "Sullen Days" doesn't sit well with me. not sure why but i don't like it.
p4763
aVI personally like sullen days for then melody at the beginning, but i agree on the rest of the song, it just kinda drags out and its just eh.

VI've liked the band since doom days and I must say they've been evolving with the rate of my musical taste. From deathcore and breakdowns to progressive and technical music. And that bass 0_0
p4774
aVOf modern bands, they really do have the most impressive progression. They started out, IMO, just really fucking awful, then got good, then really good, then kind of shitty, now I'm really looking forward to this new album. They've grown a lot.\u000a\u000aOr maybe it's because there's only one founding member. I don't know. 
p4775
aVI've been a fan of JFAC since I first heard them, and as someone else said, their style has grown with my tastes, and I'm super excited for this new album, especially since I heard that they would be revisiting their old sound, which is perfect because I've been revisiting deathcore.

aVRIP Bloodbath.  This is heartbreaking.  What made Bloodbath so absolutely amazing to me was that it was modern, with a classic throwback hint/feel.  These new songs are just completely straight up throwback.

aVi didn't care for hypocrisy at all for the first 10 years (even though as a teenager autographs were important to me, and i went to ace's records to get my copy of osculum obscenum signed by the band), but around 2004 i met a guy who loved hypocrisy and i ended up joining his band. he re-introduced me to them and now they're one of my favorites.\u000a\u000ai made a cd of the arrival and virus, and it's been playing in my car for about the past 6 months--yes, i'm fucking broke and still have a cd player in my car\u000a\u000a

aVWar Master, Blaspherian, and Morgengrau from Texas will all be up your alley. \u000a\u000aDark Descent Records has a bunch of old school worshipping bands: Maveth, Krypts, Horrendous, Lvcifyre, Corpsessed to name a few. \u000a\u000aBeyond, Dead Congregation, Thevetat are all pretty good.

aVI appreciate the sentiment. 
p4977
aVDeathcore is, in my opinion, the simplified, less musically interesting version of Death Metal. Combine that with a much shittier fan base and you've got no reason to listen to it.\u000a\u000aAnyone who chimes in to stand up for deathcore crowds: I urge you to go to a show with a classic old school death metal band and a deathcore band. In my case it was Carcass and Suicide Silence. Obviously you can guess who I was there to see. The division between the carcass fans and SS fans was amazing. The carcass fans seemed like pretty regular metalheads. The SS fans were belligerent blowhards breaking people's noses on purpose and parading around with their shirts off, showing off their Monster Energy drink tattoos. 
p4978
aVI think you damn near hit it right on the head there. The lack of respect I think comes from how simple and similar such a huge amount of deathcore bands sound and then I think the hatred side comes from douchebag scene kids acting like douchebags and starting fights/not helping people up in the pit/doing their little fighting invisible ninjas routine without regard to fucking people up. You should be bruised after spending some time in the pit...you shouldn't need to go to the damn hospital.\u000a\u000aThat said, I've definitely heard some deathcore that I liked quite a bit and I fully recognize that it shouldn't be entirely discounted across the board. Also, at least deathcore doesn't tend to have the godawful whiny vocals that metalcore tends to have, so they've got that going for them, which is nice.
p4979
aVThis was my experience when I went to see Nile and Suicide Silence opened for them. Scene kids showed up for Suicide Silence and left when Nile came on stage. Fucking left Nile. That's enough of a reason right there for me to not like them. At least I had the common courtesy to stay in the room for Suicide Silence. 
p4980
aVI saw a show from that tour at Slims in SF.  Nile and Suicide Silence.  Lots and lots of scene kid/bro types with brand name tattoos who didn't understand the idea of moshing vs. punching people in the face
p4981
aVI dunno. If you don't want to see a band, I don't think you should obligated to stay in the name of common courtesy. \u000a\u000aI personally think they might have enjoyed themselves, but anyone can do as they like.
p4982
aVFuck deathcore.
p4983
aVWhy though? Some of the bands have some really cool shit going for them. 
p4984
aVIn general, deathcore bands and fans come from very different cultural origins. As such they have very different aesthetic cues, which shows in the music they play. Same goes for me. For example, I'm a black metal fan first and foremost. So I have a particular distaste for modern sounding death metal with clean production. Similarly, a deathcore fan may have his idea of what is "good" rooted in the idea of "brutality" and thus omit songwriting such as riffs or solos. Generalisation, but you can see my point.

aVI like early Red Chord.\u000a\u000aAnd some Despised Icon.
p4988
aVI love both equally. Unfortunately though, the ratio of good Deathcore bands to bad ones isn't so good, which is why the genre gets so much hate, in my opinion. You just have to look for the good bands hidden amongst the tidal wave of crap ones- for example Ovid's Withering, Lorelei, Aversions Crown etc.\u000a\u000aAlso, I can totally understand that some people dislike it for the annoying fans.
p4989
aVMost Deathcore is crap because it's much easier to be a mediocre musician and make a Deathcore album than a mediocre musician making a Death Metal album.  This make the ratio of shit-to-gold very high in the Deathcore genre so that you usually have to wade through a ocean of shit to find what little gold there is (like say, Infant Annihilator, who actually make Deathcore look not-half-bad).\u000a\u000aThrow in the fact that you get some really idiotic fucks at a deathcore show (as amply described by witch_trial) and you basically just don't want to waste too much time with it...

aVThere's nothing wrong with blending Death Metal with Hardcore (or Metalcore) in my opinion. What does suck is that after a while it became a contest to see who could stretch their ears the biggest and who could play the most breakdowns in a song. I feel that's why it gets so much hate and why the term ''Deathcore'' has such a negative connotation.\u000a\u000a[Proof that Deathcore doesn't suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XYLiau108E)	
p4993
aVI love Beneath the Massacre and then I was at a show and somebody broke my nose for no particular reason
p4994
aVSome of it is good. But to me, it's a simplified version of death metal. Fewer awesome riffs, and more talentless breakdowns.
p4995
aVA lot of deathcore is over-produced brutality for brutality's sake bad music but I still like a lot of deathcore such as Aversion's Crown, Infant Annihilator and Acrania. I think people who listen to a couple of Suicide Silence tracks (while I like them) don't get a full overview of deathcore. There are loads of different styles of deathcore in the same way there are plenty of different styles of death metal. My favorite styles of deathcore are slam deathcore (fusing slamming/brutal death metal with hardcore, bands such as Ingested and Acrania) and down-tempo deathcore (more oriented towards the beatdown hardcore side of things, bands like The Acacia Strain and Black Tongue). These are styles of deathcore not really represented by Suicide Silence and Chelsea Grin but they hold more musical merit than a lot of the run-of-the-mill deathcore.

aVThy Art Is Murder is just about death metal, they're awesome.\u000a

aVThey were more death metal on The Adversary. Hate is just another run-of-the-mill over-produced deathcore album. Unfortunate, really. The Adversary had some really tasty shit on it.\u000a\u000aI just got angry when I heard Hate. The snare sounds like absolute shit. It drowns out any guitars when there's a blast beat going. Annoying.
p4999
aVI actually really liked Hate, though I am not paying too much attention to the production. I like the lyrical themes and Immolation is just my type of song. I understand about production getting in the way: I only like a couple of Bloodbath's studio albums (The Fathomless Mastery is one) because they don't do Bloodbath's sound justice. I like the Wacken Carnage live set - the production/sound/mix is perrrrrfect.
p5000
aVThey're pretty border-line for me, to me I'd rather just call them simplified death metal but then no one has any idea what I mean
p5001
aVYeah, what do you mean by simplified death metal? I have my own categories too, I know how that goes.

aVI dislike most deathcore, but there are a few good bands. Rose Funeral and newer Carnifex are incredible.
p5005
aVI used to be really against deathcore. The scene in the UK was dominated with Bring Me The Horizon who aren't the greatest band to represent deathcore. A couple years ago though my friend sent me some Martyr Defiled and I really liked the energy in the songs, but I was more under the impression these were a diamond in the rough.\u000a\u000a More recently I found Ovid's Withering and they really changed the game for me, absolutely top class band that have an amazing talent for creating lore, and every song is part of a greater story. Their actual songwriting is brilliant too in my opinion. There is some quality riffing in there and the breakdowns (which I will admit I totally vibe off when they're good)  are incredibly well done. They led me to find other bands such as Slice the Cake and I've been vivid off this new wave of deathcore ever since.

p5048
(lp5049
VI prefer corpsegrinder vocals, but Barnes era cannibal corpse is better. That being said, kill is still my favourite album by them.
p5050
aVVocally, Barnes, easily - but, I know people will probably accost me for this as they have before, but the Cannibal Corpse era with Fisher has produced my favourite albums/songs. I'm a sucker for technicality and lower tuned guitars - something the later albums definitely show no lack of.
p5051
aVWhat about Barnes vocals are better/do you like more? I don't have a problem with them, but it just seems like he has no power or clarity at all. Corpsegrinder is super clear and pretty damn powerful.\u000a\u000aI still very much enjoy older Cannibal, just curious.\u000a\u000aAlso, dat Frantic Disembowelment technicality.
p5052
aVMaybe that's why I liked his vocals more. Unlike Corpsegrinder, he was dirtier, more raw, more traditional. I do like Corpsegrinder's as well, though, he definitely adds a lot of punch to the mix.\u000a\u000aHell yes Frantic is amazing, but the album Kill, overall, is swimming in technical groove.
p5053
aVOh yeah. Kill is their masterpiece I think. Every song just beats the shit out of you it's amazing. One of my favorite moments is in Five Nails Through The Neck, at about 1:39 after the pause. That scream, it sounds almost like he's getting nails through HIS neck. It's agonized and everything, just awesome.
p5054
aVOh fuck yeah, that's insane. Wished they played more of this album when I saw them last time. It's so hilarious watching Corpsegrinder with his massively oversized neck, would have been sick to see him pull that track off.
p5055
aVI want to see them so bad man. They're the last of my triumvirate of bands to see live. They do play Make Them Suffer a lot though don't they?

aVBarnes by a landslide, with The Bleeding also being my favorite CC album without much competition whatsoever.  \u000a\u000aI do ask that he leaves his shit-soaked dreadlocks and hobo skater apparel at the door before he accepts this award, though.
p5060
aVcompletely agree. The Bleeding was their best album imo. i think Corpsegrinder is entertaining but Barnes' tone was better suited to their sound. ive completely lost interest in CC aside from the occasional listen. they sound generic with corpsegrinder. for me, CC died when Barnes split. also six feet under is boring musically.
p5061
aVI take it you don't like six feet under then lol
p5062
aVHehe, well, actually, I didn't mind the first 3, but then just stopped paying attention.
p5063
aVBarnes became a HUGE asshole around that time. Honestly, what I love about Barnes-era CC is the fact that he wrote his own lyrics. I heavily respect that about him. But Corpsegrinder is the more talented vocalist. I mean, put them next to each other, and George would entirely drown out Barnes without any effort.

p5069
(lp5070
VI saw Misery Index in GA before I knew about/appreciated them. They opened for Skeletonwitch (who I went to see), who opened for Job for a Cowboy. Misery Index put on the tightest live performance I have ever seen, in all of my 12 years of seeing metal shows. I was absolutely floored at how tight their show was. This isn't to say that Skeletonwitch did a bad job, they put on a fantastic show, but Misery Index' sound was flawless, and I didn't even listen to them before that show, you could just tell that they had their shit up, down, left, right, backward, forward, whatever. Now, the completely arbitrary and totally subjective standard I use to determine the caliber of a band's live show is scrutinized by how tight the band sounds, in relation to that Misery Index show. \u000a\u000aOne thing that stuck out was the consistent velocity with which the drummer used as he was playing. Every blast beat was heard clearly, and his fills were so fucking fast and smooth. JFAC was an egregious violator of this; the drummer's fills had accents the same way Christopher Walken punctuates, and you could really only hear the snare intermittenly during blast beats.\u000a\u000aThere have only been 3-4 bands ever that I've walked into a show not knowing anything about then left with show a PROFOUND appreciation for them.

aVSome of the vocals on Demonocracy and Gloom had post processing (EQs and compression and so on), but no 'effects' per se. The vocals on this were totally raw though. Jonny can do sick gutterals now though, so there's that.
p5115
aVYeah. Post processing and effects aren't the same in my book. I love his vocals and if he's added gutturals to his lows, I can't wait. 
p5116
aVThe proggy side probably came with the new bassist. Dude is a beast and Cephalic Carnage is a different taste of death metal than JFAC. 
p5117
aVThe voc effects always turned me off of these guys
p5118
aVAs in the layering? Because this is all preproduction, and it doesn't sound like there's much processing on Jonny's vocals (to me, at least). Personally, I think this is the best his vocals have ever sounded.

I don't understand the adoration, but as the cliché goes, to each their own.
p5224
aVI think some of this is all about the right time, at the right age. \u000aI like some of Cannibal Corpse's stuff.. But if someone told me today to go and check them out, I'm pretty sure I wouldnt like it at all. Listening to death metal for more than a few minutes now (some exceptions of course) is unbearable.. \u000a\u000aI never fully understood the majesty of Morbid Angel, to be honest. And since I'm too bored of death metal (some exceptions of course) I'll never will, I guess. No specific album.
p5225
aVGlad I'm not the only one. DM is my first love but there are very few bands that do it for me any more. The truth is, if I want to listen to something brutal nowadays I just turn on the news.

p5227
aVMorbid Angel (everything, except Covenant *) \u000aSuffocation (everything after Effigy of the forgotten)\u000a\u000a(*) Ironically this is one of my favourite DM albums ever
p5228
aVAnything involving melodic death metal. Fuck melodic death. Oh, that and techy wank bullshit.
p5229
aVAll melodic death ranging from Carcass' forays into it to the "not really related to death metal in any way modern melodeath?" 
p5230
aVYup. 
p5231
aVBrutal. Ever listened to Exmortus? Their more recent stuff is tech death/thrash leaning much heavier on the thrash side, but their earlier stuff was tech thrash/melodic death and is basically completely unrelated to any melodic death sound outside of them that I've ever heard. I'm convinced that if they were tuned a step down they'd be considered straight tech death/thrash. 
p5232
aVThe problem here is that I'm not super fond of thrash either. Listening to Immortality Made Flesh. This legit sounds like Children of Bodom. That is, it sounds like edgier power metal.\u000a\u000aListening to War Gods, way better but still not really up my alley.\u000a\u000aTo be fair though the sort of death metal I dig is stuff like Antediluvian, Mitochondrion, Portal, Pseudogod, Suffocation, Immolation, Incantation, Dead Congregation, etc, etc, and none of that's particularly melodic at all. I love dissonance and ugliness.
p5233
aVAs a CoB hater, I take offense at that!\u000a\u000aIn all seriousness, you know, fair enough. I listen to a bit of everything death metal (except most modern melodic death- I hate that)- I listen to everything from progressive melodic death like Persefone to OSDM to straight death to brutal death to whatever, etc etc, and while I highly dislike most straight thrash, I'm a really big fan of death/thrash (well, all mixed thrash) in general. Stuff like Exmortus (or Vader, Possessed, Hellwitch, etc) just tickles me. 
p5234
aVVader can be fun, Possessed is good, etc. I'm really more of a black/doom guy. Indian's From All Purity is my favorite album of this year by a landslide. As far as death metal, nothing's topped Pyrrhon's The Mother of Virtue.
p5235
aVFair enough. My listening is mostly death metal but overall I'm kind of all over the place- my top artists on Last FM are a black/thrash band, a prog metal/rock thing, Fleshgod Apocalypse, some classic heavy, Nile, Dying Fetus, some power metal, and then Strapping Young Lad. \u000aLately, I've been listening to a TON of Cormorant (progressive black metal that's pretty folky), and I've hit their newest 2014 release (Earth Diver) several times in the last couple of days. It's pretty good, I recommend. \u000a\u000aI haven't checked out Pyrrhon. I'll have to see what they're about tomorrow when I have the time. As far as my top albums, well, my listening tastes are broad enough that I have a hard time choosing- if my mood is very Triptkyon my favorite release is going to be very, very different than if I want Dead Congregation or Origin.

p5245
aVDeath in general are overhyped to shit and back.
p5246
aVAgreed. I enjoy Death but they get waaaay too much credit as innovators. 
p5247
aV&gt;Agreed. I enjoy Death but they get waaaay too much credit as innovators.\u000a\u000aThey had an early death/thrash demo in 1984, though...say that they're overrated musically all you want, they had some of the earliest death metal sounds out in the early/mid 80's.
p5248
aVHellhammer, Bathory, Slayer, Sodom, Kreator, Repulsion, Death Strike, Possesed, Morbid Angel, Slaughter,  Necrovore and Sepultura all had released or were releasing material around the same time frame. \u000a\u000aI didn't say Death weren't AMONG the first, but they were hardly alone, and I think a lot of people forget the contributions of the above bands. Slayer, for example,  was releasing fully-formed death metal in 1984 with Haunting the Chapel, and anyone who wants to cry "but that's thrash!" needs to listen to it again and remember that guttural vocals are just one part of what defines the genre. 
p5249
aVHellhammer, Bathory, and Sodom were the first wave of a different type of extreme metal that certainly influenced the death metal to come but can hardly be counted as part of it. Slayer and Kreator may have been more aggressive thrash, but even though you say preemptively counter by calling them death (with Slayer), well, I disagree. Aggressive thrash may have turned into death metal but death metal they weren't. \u000a\u000aMorbid Angel, Necrovore, Repulsion, Death Strike, and Sepultura came after Death By Metal. Some of those bands formed the same year, even, that Death By Metal came out. Possessed's Death Metal demo was the same year as Death By Metal.\u000a\u000aTo say that Death By Metal was anything but one of the very first releases approaching genuine death metal is unfair to Death. Even if you don't like them or think they were influential towards the beginning, you can't deny that they had a death/thrash demo early enough that they have to be given SOME credit. 
p5250
aVI think you're thinking I disagree with you more than I do. I DO like Death and I DO think they were influential, and among the first. My issue is that people point to Death as the sole innovator, which is doubtful. \u000a\u000aBy 1986 all of those bands had released music in some format. Surely you can agree that full length albums with label support from Possesed, Kreator and Slayer  were influencing the scene as a whole by 1985, to an extent that at least competed with a demo tape from an unsigned Florida band? You even refer to the Mantas demo as "death/thrash", a label which could fit almost any of the proto-death acts I listed. \u000a\u000aAs for Hellhammer et al, yes, the ultimate extension of those bands is black metal, but at the time the terms death and black metal did not exist in the way they do now. Those genres developed nearly simultaneously and have many shared influences. \u000a\u000aMy point: Death were not alone. They are an important piece of the puzzle, but the origins of death metal are a wave of bands from 1983-1986, all innovating techniques, styles, aesthetics, etc and influencing each other (Chuck and the Repulsion guys tried to merge into a Death line up at one point, for instance). You can't point to ONE band as inventing death metal, it isn't that simple. 
p5251
aV&gt;I think you're thinking I disagree with you more than I do. I DO like Death and I DO think they were influential, and among the first. My issue is that people point to Death as the sole innovator, which is doubtful.\u000a\u000aOopsies. Fair enough, mate. You're completely right, and I agree with basically all of your points- hell, didn't everyone else steal Slayer's drumming from Reign In Blood? They have probably as much, if not more,  influence on death metal than Death themselves between that, their popularity, and their extremity in the thrash scene. \u000a\u000aI have a bad tendency to get overly defensive every time someone says something like "Slayer invented death metal" (because they didn't) or if I interpret them to be dissing Death or Possessed or whoever.

aVIf you miss groove in tech death you should check out Iniquity!

p5260
aVAnything by Dismember. Just don't get it. It feels like heavy rock or some sort of punk/thrash hybrid to me. Maybe I haven't heard the right albums.
p5261
aVI recommend the self-titled "Dismember" album. If you are not blown away by "Black sun" then I don't know what else will do the job :) \u000a\u000aBut my all time favourite is definitely "Indecent &amp; Obscene".

aVA morgue isn't a cemetary, it's just a place where the dead bodies are kept before burial or creamation.\u000aAlso it's a song,not an album just by the way.\u000aAdditionally, I agree in the fact that it is trying to hard.

aVThis also makes me feel old. \u000aCannibal corpse, nice find OP i bet no one has ever heard of them
p5413
aVI actually never listened to this song by Cannibal Corpse despite the fact that I listen to a lot of lesser known DM bands like Immolation, Demilich and Timeghoul. Since, you know, most people categorically dismiss Canninal Corpse as an "entry level" band.\u000a\u000aEven though, in reality, this shit is heavier than all three of the bands I mentioned before. And grittier than stuff like Carcass, Bolt Thrower and Obituary. \u000a\u000aI've been around the death metal block quite a few times. So imagine my surprise when the most obvious and "entry level" band of them all is heavier, grittier and nastier than almost of the stuff that's deeper underground.\u000a\u000aAnd man do I love my death metal heavy, gritty and nasty. The Cannibal Corpse way.

p5432
aVTry Wretched - Cannibal. Great band and album, fits somewhat close to what you're describing. Hope you enjoy!
p5433
aVSuffocation are the masters of the style Cannibal is famous for. Pure percussive brutality. \u000a\u000aImmolation for more cryptic, memetic riffing and structure. \u000a\u000aIncantation for doom laden, oppressive occult metal. \u000a\u000aBolt Thrower for grinding, pummeling, war themed death. \u000a\u000aThe first three or four albums by all of these are essential.\u000a
p5434
aVI'm gonna try out suffocation. Since its been brought up like 3 Times.
p5435
aVI'd recommend starting with the album Pierced from Within. Effigy of the Forgotten is in many ways a superior record, but the production is a little flatter and if you're fairly new to death metal (which it sounds like you are) Pierced will be easier to get into.

aVWar Master is insanely good. One of the best death metal bands to come along in probably the last 15 years if not longer. \u000a\u000aAlong with the J Read bands listed here I'd suggest Heresiarch and Diocletian. Both are more on the death side of war metal and use a fair amount of doom
p5474

p5533
aVAnd that's the main thing i love about this, and most old-school/underground DM, is that they aren't being sarcastic. Earnest all the way through. The symbolism would take a while to explain, but I like the liminal imagery and lyrical themes - his eternal fate is important but still hangs in the balance.

VMelodic Death Metal actually IS MeloDeath. If you mean Death Metal with melody, the first 3 albums of At The Gates are incredibly good. Dismember,  Dissection, Necrophobic, Unanimated fit the bill too.
p5573
aV&gt; Melodic Death Metal actually IS MeloDeath\u000a\u000aOf course you're correct. I don't mean to say they're separate genres. I've heard other people use the terms to make a distinction between styles of melodic death just for the sake conversation and I think that is a useful way to talk about styles if only for the sake of threads like this. \u000a\u000aThanks for the suggestions!\u000a\u000a

aVI was actually listening to [Desultory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKnE-I7b1U4) earlier today. They definitely fit the bill.\u000a\u000aThere is a lot of death metal from the early 90s stockholm scene that kind of paved the way for the later full on gothenburg melodic death metal.\u000a\u000a\u000aGenerally most melodic death metal albums released after 2000 are not really death metal anymore so if you do a search on metal archives on melodic death metal albums before 2000 you are bound to find a bunch of stuff.

aVInto Eternity is such a great album. 
p5580
aVBe'lakor maybe? Not really sure what constitutes as "melodic death that isn't melodeath" but you might enjoy them. 
p5581
aVBe'lakor is a damn good band but not really what I meant here. I mean something that is solidly death metal but just happens to be a bit more melodic than usual. \u000a\u000aEDIT: coherence. I can type I swear.
p5582
aVI don't know man, I listen to mainly normal death. How about Death's later albums especially their last? You probably already know about them but that's all I got

aVYeah it's not the best recording quality, but it's a demo. I like the riff on Amongst the Ruins around the minute 30 mark and I see potential in it- The Fall of Eden I can see being pretty cool with better recording equipment and maybe a different tone on the guitar. I'll make sure to keep an eye on you guys

(lp5627
VCarved from Stone and Sapphire really blew my mind when they were released, but after listening to the album it feels like too much of that. There's no real change song from song. It's an interesting dynamic for metal, but from what's been dropped this year so far, it's going to fall off my radar pretty quick. Can't wait to witness these dudes next week!
p5628
aVThat's kind of what they went for I feel, the whole album seems to tell a story of some sort almost haha.
p5629
aVI really like the atmosphere it creates, but most of it doesn't feel all that memorable. I'll probably use it more as background music. Still enjoy it though!
p5630
aVI think I really enjoy it because at the moment I'm working on a demo with a friend of mine and getting things right when I record and write music can be really challenging, these guys had to not only perform top notch but to get the sound they wanted across they had to have good studio production too, which they did, and it really paid off. Plus that drummer is fucking insane, and their guitarist is a superb writter. Hell even the ambience in the background enhances and emphasizes the music their playing.

aVI've always been, and continue to be, a devout Once Upon the Cross guy.  One of the best albums ever, regardless of band, era, or metal genre.  That said, it's silly to argue with others over their favorite Deicide album as they are legends and simply being a fan of the band is what matters.
p5648
aVLegion is the shit.

aVIt sounds kinda douchey hipsterish to say but their debut is still their best work, IMO. The recent stuff is really good as well, though.

aVHey now, no need to belittle your own opinion.  Besides, that has nothing to do with being *hipsterish*.
p5651
aVhaha thanks. I just mean that "the early stuff was way better" is kind of a rote hipster response. 
p5652
aVi've never been able to get into their later stuff really. first album was so groundbreaking when it came out. literally nothing like it anywhere. probably not a popular opinion but most of their stuff past Legion sounds like rehash to me.

aVI like the debut and Legion so much it's hard for me to listen to later albums. I'll spin Once and Serpents on a rainy day, but never anything past that.

aVI have five Deicide albums, their last four and their debut album. And out of the ones I have, the last two are definitely the best in my opinion. I'm trying to find more of their old stuff, I'm aiming for all their albums. They're by far my favourite death metal band
