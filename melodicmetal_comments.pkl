VStu Block is the best thing to happen to this band since pre-9/11 Barlow. Yup I said it, when Barlow came back from being a cop, he didn't have the same emotion as in the past.\u000a\u000aBut to be fair Block can't touch albums like Burnt Offerings or Dark Saga -- actually not many can.. Barlow was amazing back then!

sVGrave Digger - Heavy Metal Breakdown
p27
(lp28
VFuck yeah, Grave Digger kicks ass.\u000a\u000aI have no idea why they keep getting downvoted when I post em in /metal/
p29
aVMost trad stuff seems to sink over there if it's not from a band as hugely popular as Maiden, Priest, Blind Guardian, etc. I guarantee you the only time Grave Digger got more than 10 upvotes over there was because Skuld posted a song that featured Hansi Kursch.
p30
aVYeah, black/death metal is a tad over-represented there.\u000aHonestly I don't feel much death metal is that heavy. \u000aThe buzzsaw guitar sound where they are just rapidly playing one chord lacks punch to me.\u000a\u000aI figured if they gave it a chance they would love Chris's gruff singing style.
p31
aV&gt; if they gave it a chance\u000a\u000aThat's part of the problem - anything that's not instantly recognizable doesn't get a chance.
p32
aVSadly, sometimes r/Metal doesn't like power that much\u000a\u000aAnyway, You are welcome to post over here,\u000a\u000aJust remember, keep it at r/Melodicmetal specification :D
p33
aVGrave Digger isn't always that melodic though.\u000aThey are more of a crunchy speed metal band.
p34
aVcan you point a crunchy speed metal track by them? \u000a\u000aI have listened to a couple of theirs tracks, so far they sound post-able over here.
p35
aVShit, I would classify the track in this post as crunchy speed metal. Sure, it has a solo part towards the end, but for the most part it is crunchy speed metal. At least that's how I would classify it.
p36
aVHere's ["Headbanging Man"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC3nIVb06k4) from the same album.\u000a\u000aTo be honest, I never got into anything of theirs after the first three albums. They got a lot more polished and IMO Boltendahl's voice doesn't suit that kind of material nearly as well.

VI miss Roy...
p388
aVI... kinda preordered their upcoming album from hearing this song alone :/
p389
aVI went to a drum clinic a few weeks ago with Casey Grillo and he said it's his favorite album they've done...he performed "Sacrimony" and another song from the new album "Solitaire" and it just blew me away. So preordered as well.
p390
aVHeard the whole album, its amazing. Will feel good when my album arrives.
p391
aVListening to this song gave me the same impression as when I recently listened to the new "Luca Turilli's Rhapsody" band. Sure it's the same same music, great sound, wicked production, and precision instrumentation, but it's not the same. This is like Iron Maiden with Blaze Bailey, or Iced Earth with Stu Block (okay okay Stu Block is really good, but he's no Barlow)\u000a\u000aFor the record this guy is pretty good, but he's no Khan and shouldn't try to sing like him. I'd like to listen to the rest of the album before I can make the judgement. \u000a\u000a
p392
aVHad my first listen today.  Mind you, I LOVED Khan-Kamelot.  I've listened to every album with him as the lead a hundred times over.... but...\u000a\u000aThis album was good, not great.  I thought the same about Poetry, actually.  Neither compared at all in my mind to Black Halo or Ghost Opera.\u000a\u000aMind you, this was only my first listen, and my opinion could change significantly as I listen a few more times.
p393
aVThe best song on an otherwise forgettable album. Kamelot have seriously lost their touch, mainly by straying too far into the symphonic, they're basically an FFM band with a male singer now.

VI really wish that this band could've realised its potential (3 EPs/1 live show,as was the plan). Such a shame that Tony died last year.\u000a\u000aThe slight consolation is that Solstice are likely to start playing 'Mighty &amp; Superior' live soon as apparently they've been rehearsing it.
p514
aVEven before Tony died it had pretty much been shelved. I asked Perry about it last month and he said he's always been willing to continue on with it but there's likely zero chance of it ever happening. (*edit Even during the years when Solstice wasn't especially active.)\u000a\u000a"Mighty and Superior" was originally Solstice's "Englander" anyways, so I'll bet a beer it pops up on their next album with the original lyrics restored.
p515
aVI know, but had he still been alive the chances of it eventually being completed were at least 'sort of' there.\u000a\u000aI knew it was originally intended for the follow up to 'New Dark Age' but I thought the reason it went on to become part of the Isen Torr thing is that it wasn't 'Solsticey' enough.
p516
aVNot to get all gossip-y, but considering the falling out Tony and Rich had, I seriously doubt he would have been a part of it had the other EPs happened.\u000a\u000aWhether or not it's "Solstice-y" enough I wouldn't mind hearing the version Solstice did with Moz Ingram even though Rich swears up down left and right it's inferior to the Isen Torr retooling of it. (And I don't doubt him, simply because of how killer "Mighty and Superior" is.)\u000a\u000aSpeaking of post-New Dark Age stuff, I wouldn't mind seeing "Bloodfeud" resuscitated, but I doubt it'll happen. It sounds like the new lineup is writing a lot, and if "I am the Hunter" is any indication it'll be a worthy successor to New Dark Age.

p759
aVIt's different from their previous works for sure, but I'm not as disappointed in it as I thought I would be, given all the hints that had been dropped that the new album would be more "thrash"y. It maintains a strong melodic line, goes together well, and still has a variety of instrumental lines. I look forward to the rest of the album!

aVSelf-irony. This is the best thing in power metal, and therefore in metal at all. Helloween were already laughing about it all in a time when bands actually used to get credit by taking themselves seriously with all the evilness bullshit. Such brilliant people

aVHm. I mostly agree with you, but I really don't see Dreamshade as a metalcore band. I'm definitely catching the metalcore influence that you're catching, but in my opinion, they're style is predominately melo death.\u000a \u000aAaaand now I'm seeing the rule against posting melodic death metal (I swear I read the rules, I just didn't see that last one :p). \u000a\u000aWell anyway, to me Dreamshade distinguish themselves so much from metalcore with their technical melo death-style riffing and soaring melodies, that their style is the epitome of melodic metal. But that's just me. Great insight, though.
p873
aVIf you cant sense the heavy metalcore definitions in their songs, you arent listening very hard or you dont want them to be.\u000a\u000aIts ok to like other genres, but using them outside of "how a band sounds" is stupid.\u000a\u000aPersonally I hate metalcore because, as the sound of metalcore is defined, I find really boring and often sound like a cheap mimic of In Flames.\u000a\u000aBut this song is definitely an exception, however their other songs I cant stand.

Unfortunatly when I go listen to the full album of some of the songs, it is not really up to the greatness of that specific song.\u000a\u000a* "Come by the Hills" - Symfonia: If it wasn't for the voice, I would think I was listening to Stratovarius.\u000a* "Legion" - Aska : This guys must really love Bruce Dickinson.\u000a* "Wake Up Screaming" - Witchfynde : Really makes me feel like I'm listening to old school Horror Punk.\u000a* "Descending" - Embound : Love it.\u000a* "Pandemonium" - Pretty Maids: Love it.\u000a\u000aetc etc...

I'm positively amazed about this playlist because most of the times playlists just mirror the personal tastes of someone and the songs are not necessary good, but this one is really good.

VIt's criminal that this song along with Dawn of Battle were left off of 'Warriors of the World'. If you removed 'Nessun Dorma' and 'American Trilogy' and replaced them with those two from the single the album quality on the whole would increase hugely.
p1205
aVI was hopping they where a teaser for the new album when I got the single.\u000a\u000aFor a good year I forgot that they where only on the single and was wondering why the fuck they weren't on my computer after I ripped all my music. I eventually when't looking for Manowar torrents to see if I was missing an album or if they where only on a specific version of Warriors of the World or Gods of War only to find they where on one of the 2 CDs I didn't rip!
p1206
aVMANOWAR!
p1207
aVEric Adams fucking rules. Easily the most important member of MANOWAR!
p1208
aVI would disagree on the basis of one song, Guyana (Cult of the Dammed). Through ever song you could say that the thing that makes you realize its a Manowar song is either Erics voice or Joeys bass equally. But in Guyana it is ALL the first few bars of the bass during the intro. \u000a\u000aWhen it comes to being the front man I sometimes wish it was Eric because even though I'm a huge fucking Manowar fan sometimes Joey talking makes me cringe and just wish he would shut up. :P 
p1209
aVJoey comes off as a narcissistic meathead with questionable conscience.
p1210
aVI would agree with this he is up himself (with good reason hes an epic bassist and has a better physique in his late 50s than most of us have in our teens) and needs to learn a bit of humility and to lay off the over the top warrior talk off stage lol! It's epic when he is doing all that shit on stage (the fact that he didn't do it on stage was one of my main complaints about the latest tour) but when you see him in a restaurant doing it, it just comes across as a bit "the old mans went a bit loopy" :P

p1265
aVi liked albums twilight, dw, v, odyssey, and some of paradise lost.  not into their new stuff really.  kinda went in a different direction on their latest 2 albums.
p1266
aVOh yeah, I forgot about Odyssey, that was a great album too. I saw them live in Seattle when they were touring the album back in 02` or something. Was an amazing concert!\u000a\u000aLately, I think their problem is that they almost got too full of themselves with all the hype surrounding the band. They are all phenomenal musicians, world class, no doubt. I think this notion got to them and whether it was pride or just trying to expand their musicianship, an album like iconoclast is just too much of a good thing. Like many professional athletes are told, they need to simplify their game!   \u000a\u000aEither way, I'm still a fan for life, I just wish SX would release another album similarly paced to their older material!
p1267
aVyeah...it seemed to happen when they signed with nuclear blast which may or may not have something to do with it.  sx is my favorite band by far.  i also got to see them live when they came to anaheim, california.  there were like 50 people that showed up for the concert.  they were headlining along with iced earth, whom i think played far too long where as sx played far too little and too much off their newest album.  it was still pretty cool though.

On the other hand they did play a couple of songs of this album: Blood Brothers and The Wickerman. Both of these were damn amazing during the concert.\u000a\u000aWhat really boggles me is that they didn't play any song of A Matter of Life and Death.

aVOh cool cuz i was planning to see their show in Dallas in September, but wasnt sure if i should. I never even got to see Roy live T.T Poetry was alright but the best two albums by far were Ghost Opera, then Black Halo
p1524
aVPoetry for the Poisoned is good... But when you compare it to Epica and the Black Halo, it's really not too great... Really I wouldn't mind seeing Fabio take over for Khan... I heard that Rhapsody of Fire is breaking up, so it's a possibility.

asVIssues with formulaic song writing?
p1738
(lp1739
VMy understanding is that their reputation is largely based on generally cheesy songwriting paired with outrageous guitar wankery. They can pull off some pretty blazing fast solos in the studio and they're actually quite fun to listen to, but you're not going to find a lot of depth in their songwriting. Their recent album ain't bad though. Here's a funny video for ya Dragonforce Greatest Hits: http://youtu.be/SQSGVGTepSg
p1740
aVThat's hilarious. That is actually exactly what it sounded like listening to an entire album.
p1741
aVFor me, DragonForce is a band with a gimmick and nothing else. Nothing they offer interests me.
p1742
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5iHeg_dPY\u000a\u000aDragonforce were well thought of in the power metal scene before 'Guitar Hero' and many power metal bands suffer from self-plagiarism, formulaic approaches and cliché. Some are honestly better for it. The problem is perhaps more apparent for Dragonforce simply because they're more well known. \u000a\u000aSounding like they did in 2006 brought them stratospheric and unheard of success for a power metal band in the UK (with Sabaton the only band repeating it since), so it's natural that they would try to replicate that sound.

aVI want my tears back.\u000aI can't stop listening to it and the pipes have really grown on me.
p2392
aVI think at the moment, my favorite songs are Last Ride of the Day and Slow, Love, Slow.\u000a\u000aOverall, this is my favorite album from them, and Anette is a step above Tarja in my books after multiple listening sessions. (unpopular opinion?)
p2393
aVI agree about Anette. Tarja has a great voice, but she never had Anette's passion in my opinion. There are some classic songs that, honestly, I don't think Anette should touch, like Wishmaster or Kinslayer, but there are songs that I think Anette sings way better, like Ever Dream, She Is My Sin, and Dark Chest of Wonders.
p2394
aVAlso, I feel like Nightwish really went in a direction (starting with Century Child) that didn't mesh at all with Tarja's singing style. Century Child and Once are still fantastic albums, but I can't think of a single song on them (okay, maybe Creek Mary's Blood) that I wouldn't prefer to hear Anette's voice on.

aVI agree, I really don't see Tarja's vocals playing well at all with this album. \u000a\u000aBesides I want my tears back with the slight to operatic vocals. 
p2396
aVAnnette is no where near Tarja\u000a\u000aOne is an operatic singer, the other sounds the same as all the other gothic metal bands, lacuna coil, sirenia etc......
p2397
aVBeing operatic doesn't make you a better singer. It just means you are operatic.
p2398
aVWhich was the nightwish sound\u000a\u000a\u000aNow they are just the same as lacuna coil sirenia etc....
p2399
aVThey sound nothing like those bands. Nightwish's sound is and was symphonic, not operatic.
p2400
aVok
p2401
aVI haven't listened to the album but 'Turn Loose the Mermaids' has the best song title in the history of everything
p2402
aVIt's a good one. It's a slower ballad.
p2403
aVdoes this album feature much of Marco? btw glad to see a post here that ISN'T a song on youtube lol, tho i love those too
p2404
aVThere's a lot of Marco. He is the only one who sings in the opening track, and he has a lot of parts in at least half the songs.
p2405
aVScarytale for one, he shows up quite often.

aVawwwww yeahh thanks guys. After listening to Tarot, decided to see what the fuss was about Nightwish, [wasn't disappointed](http://youtu.be/9QXwNgwUnnk)
p2408
aVFor me right now it's a tie between I Want My Tears Back and The Crow the Owl and the Dove. Overall a great album. Probably my second favorite after Once.
p2409
aVI Want My Tears Back is probably my pick, after giving it a proper listen.
p2410
aVMy favorite is Song of Myself.\u000aThe poem at the end really gets to me.
p2411
aVIt would have to be scaretale.\u000aJust the way in which all of the portions interact to bring forth to the ears the delight of the macabre and creepy. I am sure it reminds us all of the fears we had as children covering from circuses. Ah its just a great song, in my opinion at least.
p2412
aVHave only listened through it once, but I have to say that I actually only liked Storytime, or atleast it stood way above the others. Sorry.

p2450
aVSean Peck. But absolutely, fairly sure he's even got the bald/beard combo going on too.\u000a\u000aAlmost too hard to keep up with Cages releases though, they really are a prolific band.

VThe cover sounds like [Evergrey's The Inner Circle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/TheInnerCircle.jpg). They play progressive metal, so it might be it.
p2603
aVThis is a longshot, but it could be ['Grey' by Tarot](http://youtu.be/zH4e7D0kpok).\u000a\u000aThe image colors are like you described and it indeed is a picture of an eye. However it's not the album cover.\u000a\u000aThe musical style is somewhat similar to the one described. However the vocalist doesn't exactly scream.
p2604
aVI found another candidate. This one fits the description of being removed and the eye being the album cover. However the musical style is less like the one described.\u000a\u000a[Sonata Arctica - The Wolves Die Young](http://youtu.be/kpSmJsk-7xY)

aVSaxon's best album post-early 80s. Closely followed by 'Metalhead'. The fact that two Germans play on the album is probably a contributing factor, Jörg Michael (Drums) &amp; Chris Bay (Keys/Orchestration) both played on this album.\u000a
