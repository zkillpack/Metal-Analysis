"Looking to start a PV band in NYC and I don't know where else to look!!!","looking for other creeps and nerds to start a powerviolence or a fastcore band with. I play guitar and bass and scream really loud to try and get my point across that life sucks. I'm looking for others specifically drums to jam with. I'm way into all the original bands that you're into but also bands like Iron Lung, Kung fu Rick, and SFN. With that being said, I'm looking to do a weird PV band more in the vein of dystopia with really fast parts and maybe a few odd time signatures in it because fuck you and your bobbing head. Anyway, I have a car and will travel to closer surrounding states to do this so if anyone is interested or know anyone that may be interested let me know.

"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","Nice!"
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","This band refused to play a show because a gay guy used the word faggot in an improv doom metal band. I paid 8 bucks to see 2 local bands because instead of confronting whatever the hell offended them they packed up and left and got mad at all the people who came out to see them. If you want to make a political statement, make one, don't ruin everyone's night."
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","the details you provided aren't very illuminating. just cause you're gay doesn't give you free reign to use the word faggot in anyway you want: self-reference, cool, calling an audience member faggot, not cool. For some reason I seriously doubt that the incident alone caused them to leave."
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","Context, the line was ""Jesus was a faggot"".  I think they used that as a sort of excuse to get out of there, as the show was in a remote location and many bands don't realize just how far it can be between cities up there, so when you arrive later than you hoped to a dingy bar with only a few people, it can be disappointing.  I, the singer in question, was in highschool at the time.  I think their other problem was class based.  The venue was not full of the sort of College-Anarchos that they were initially used to seeing, but rather non-radical, working class, children and young adults, in one of the roughest parts of the roughest cities in the country.

And they were tourmated with another band ""Lab Rat"" who was playing similar stuff with a more vegan slant.  It's no known if it is lab rat or rape revenge who pulled the plug on the gig, but once the bus is leaving, the bus is leaving.

In the letter exchange that ensued between LR, RR, and the doom band, the doom band's guitar player was told he was white, while he was native, in a sort of low-level vulgar-anarchist strategy to negate his opinion on social justice issues.  It was particularly disappointing as I was indeed a Goldman-esque anarcho-feminist at the time, and was really excited to meet these people.

No one from the doom band harbours any resentment, we are no longer active, and we understand that even the most ""enlightened"" people can become uncomfortable when on the road, surrounded by folks from a lower socio-economic class, who haven't had anarchist non-oppression training by the nature of them being brought up in a practically segregated city with no working class movement or even much queer liberation, and being between 15-18 years old.

That being said, I think the ""silly"" nature of our music did not contextualize the line properly in a way that if it were a beat poem or piano ballad, it might have.  Improvisational doom, even compared to PV bands can be seen as unprofessional.  This event has largely spurred my study of theology and musicology."
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","You seem to be making a lot of assumptions in regards to how comfortable the band is around working class people. I heard a similar argument when I went to see Punch and the lead singer criticized people for smoking cigarettes in the venue: but these weren't people from a cyclical institutionalized poverty but rather white hipster punks with college degrees. If it was, in your words, ""a dingy bar with only a few people,"" that probably had a lot more to do with it. I would need the full context to judge the whole ""you're white!"" issue, but it is a problem amongst white radicals so I wouldn't be too surprised and that is pretty disappointing. Conversely from the impressions I've had of Rape Revenge I think they have experience with all the things that you claim they do not.

And I'd probably be pissed about that line too. It sounds like something a stupid 13 year old ""satanist"" would say. Though I would've just told you to your face."
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","Maybe they gained that experience over the course of the last three years?  Their music has developed at a rate that would suggest that, perhaps their personal experience has.  I dunno.  I did watch them uncomfortable shuffle about at their merch table for hours and hours before and during the show, totally Rockstar and not meet any of the kids.  They only met with any other BANDS after they had decided to leave and they were all but begged to play by another local bass player.  They gave him an 8 inch, however.  If I remember correctly, the band that was coerced into leaving gave the 8 inch.

Furthermore, a similar grindy touring band, The Young Tongues were there the whole time, watched the whole thing, commented on it during their set, and of course, because they weren't actually touring WITH the other bands, stayed and played.

My assumption about their comfort level only comes from watching hundreds of other bands react to the same situation.  Our geographical location forces all cross canada touring bands to stop by virtue of distance.  The more proletarian/libertine/open-minded bands act one way, and the bougie bands act a different one, with almost no bands behaving in the middle, or behaving differently."
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","I like to consider myself a pretty PC guy, it wasn't directed at anyone it was in a REALLY really shitty song that was made up on the spot. They were trying to make a point because they played with a band that they thought had nothing in common politically with them, but really we all went to the show to see them.

I don't disagree with their message, I'm just saying that they were really mean.


As an aside from a songwriting perspective, these are some of the lamest lyrics ever written.

Regardless of your agreement with the manner of expression, it is protected. The mature thing to do would be to confront the perceived misuse and discuss it as adults.

I agree there needs to be more to the story, but there'd have to be a LOT more to the story to justify shitting all over people who came to see your show because of something one of the other bands' members said."
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","&gt;it is protected

so you're saying punk bands should be respecting the law?"
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","&gt;just cause you're gay doesn't give you free reign to use the word faggot

A lot more than fuzzytoe's internet decree, yes. You don't dictate what people can and can't say, and you can in fact go around saying 'faggot' as much as you like in whatever context you choose.

If punk bands of all people aren't respecting the first amendment, then punk has become a fascist bullshit hypocrisy."
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","This band along with a pretty large majority of punks are not American constitutionalists. They're anarchists. Anarchists tend not to recognize various legal systems. For an anarchist or radical to be opposed to the use of offensive words doesn't make them a hypocrite as they don't adhere to your set of laws.

You have a lot to learn about punk, buddy. "
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","Anarchy is more about freedom than it is about eschewing laws simply because they are laws. To spit in the face of freedom in the name of freedom is hypocrisy.

You have a lot to learn about ideals, buddy."
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","At no point did I say freedom of speech isn't important. I said to expect anarchist and punks to uphold the 1st amendment is just silly. Freedom of speech and freedom in general exist outside of the Constitution. This doesn't mean people shouldn't be allowed to react to what they consider offensive or that people shouldn't in some way be held accountable for hate speech. 

I'm not saying the artist in question was committing hate speech or even meant it in an offensive way. You just can't expect everyone to sit there and deal with what in there eyes is offensive. I feel for the people who went to go see them and got fucked over but I also understand not wanting to deal with someone who had pissed you off. To say that is fascist and hypocritical is just ridiculous. "
"Rape Revenge. Awesomely brutal feminist PV from Canada.","first amendment? you're one of those rock the vote types aren't you? People can say whatever they want but don't be a wimp when the people that slur is used against peace out/get pissed/kick your bigoted ass. Fascist bullshit hypocrisy lol the first amendment protects fascism in this country."

"Let's talk about how No Man's Slave is the best LP to be released in the last decade (in any genera of punk/hardcore)","&gt;On July 1, 1991, Infest recorded a live set for the Los Angeles radio station KXLU. This session was later released by Deep Six Records who also released the No Man's Slave LP. The vocals on No Man's Slave were recorded post-breakup in 2000 and the LP was released later in 2002.

Personally I've always felt a bit mixed about this LP because of this."

"
"I'm fairly new to powerviolence. I have a question...","It's cheaper for the bands involved than a full solo release, requires fewer songs (and when your average song length is 15 seconds, this helps), and probably best of all it allows people to discover new bands.  Buy a split because I love Band A, then discover that I also now love Band B."

"I'm fairly new to powerviolence. I have a question...","I totally hear you.  I've been listening to it for probably over a decade and it's just annoying.  Especially when you're poor.  1000x worse with noise, though.  Only genre of music with more releases a year than people into it.  How the hell a person puts out 4-6 tapes/CDr's each year is beyond me.  Anyhow, I finally gave up on trying to get everything Water Torture's put out and traded in all my 7""s of theirs to a store yesterday.  Thankfully it's a store that gives good credit, so I made out well.

Btw this is one of the reasons that a lot of bands eventually put out compilations of their releases on LP or CD.  Water Torture has a discog LP coming out soon..."

Although MITB had a variety of bass tones, along with a variety of basses.

I still find Spazz's to be pretty unique. It's a very polished, thick tone, but maintains that hardcore bass twang."

Those are the first things we've ever done, so it wasn't exactly the best.  We've got some new stuff recorded and on the way, and I think it sounds a lot better, both mix-wise and musical wise.

"Never posted before, could you guys and gals give me some feedback on this band I help with? (bandcamp link)","Haha, I'm actually the drummer and singer.  It's just me and my friend, he plays guitar live.  When we record we just kind of switch off on whatever we want to play, ha.  But yeah, I don't hit the bass drum as much.  I try to give the fast parts a little less bass drum because I think it sounds cooler to just kick super hard whenever a guitar riff changes or something.  Regardless, thanks for the feedback, dude.  I sincerely appreciate it.

And big ups to you two for not being dicks.  That rules."
"Never posted before, could you guys and gals give me some feedback on this band I help with?

Any grind/powerviolence/anything similar bands that want to tell Fred Phelps to hurry up and die, and probably have the comp sent to his children, write a song lyrically matching the theme, and send it our way. Hoping to get 20 - 40 bands, so don't hesitate to join in the fun.

Here's the Bandcamp.
http://dickcrushrecords.bandcamp.com/
And the Facebook.
https://www.facebook.com/DICKCRUSHRECORDS

Let us know on Fartbook or message me here if you want in.
That old bastard's gonna kick the bucket soon, and I'd like to get a copy to Shirley while it's still fresh, so let's go go go!

EDIT: I should be more specific with the genres. We'll take anything grind, powerviolence, hardcore, thrash, doom, slam, sludge, even punk rock (although we might be a little picky with that last one). Anything you play that is even similar to those genres is good. Anything one might call ""extreme music"" will fit right in."

"New Cursed Altar album. Black Metal, Powerviolence, Crust, Doom mix. Enjoy.","My gods, the compression sounds like ass. The music is well written, but whoever mastered the music is retarded, and doesn't know how to use compression. The drums sound terrible, and the guitars are too muddy, which is odd considering how gainy and mid-focused they are.  It's like they threw the entire album through a heavy compressor after it was mixed, instead of compressing individual instruments as needed.  Total production abuse. Another example of digital trash ruining great music."

"So I'm fairly new to Powerviolence. Halp!","The only reason I know it exists is because of Ceremony and Trash Talk. I havent heard much from Trash Talk in the last year and a half and Ceremony is Indie all of a sudden? 

I'm looking for something that is heavy, has loads of feedback and is fast.
Then again, I'm not really sure what ""true"" power violence is, I just thought it was another form of hardcore (Kind of like a derivative, traditional styled bands being like Bane and Have Heart. While you have heavier stuff like Death Threat and Terror.) Though, I think I may be wrong. "
"So I'm fairly new to Powerviolence. Halp!","MAN IS THE BASTARD

Also the aforementioned Spazz.  Additionally you need to realize that power violence isn't exclusively fast.  It's really fucking fast then crashes to a halt for some sludgy hatred before blasting off again.  It's that back and forth that defines it."

It'll take you a few years but you can get an amazing rig for really cheap. It took me forever to get all my gear but it was so worth it. If you're on a budget my main advice would be to stay far far away from Marshall amps. Get a nice, used Peavey head. 5150's usually go for really cheap, and if you're super duper vigilant you can get your hands on a Butcher. Both great for the type of music you want to play, even without a pedal in front. Also, you can get boss DS-1's for like 20 bucks used. Definitely worth looking into."

"'You're Crazy - Volume One' - An anthology of stories from the hardcore punk scene","You’re Crazy Volume One compiles twenty-five first-hand accounts of people from the punk scene who live with mental illness, addiction and trauma. This volume also includes two stories of punk rockers who are allies to those of us who struggle and their experience. This book exists to help empower the writers who are sharing their personal experiences so that they can be better understood. It also exists to help show that we are not alone in this world and that life can get better. It’s a necessity in our community. We all deserve to be heard. You’re Crazy aims to help decrease the stigma that the authors, and those like them, face while dealing with mental illness, addiction and trauma. By sharing their stories they are putting themselves on the line as they take ownership of their lives and experiences while demonstrating the reality of their lives. These stories educate and inspire, increasing understanding and empathy while reducing stigma.

"Female fronted powerviolence?","Not a band that's around anymore, but Pisspoor from Austin, TX immediately came to mind.  They were around in the mid-90s and had a split 7"" (with Yokel) and a split LP (with Ungrateful.....on Sound Pollution Records).

Saw them once at ABC No Rio in NYC and they were pretty great.  Their singer, Cathy, was as nice and sweet as could be....but once she was on the mic, the bowels of hell emerged.

Found their side of the split LP on YouTube:  http://youtu.be/oC1IhHnayd8

Another band that comes to mind was Coleman....who I think were from Massachusetts, but I wouldn't swear to it.  Saw them once too.  They were a trio without a bass player.  They had a 7"" and a split LP with Three Studies for a Crucifixion.

Found a song from the split LP...not really sure they were really power-violence in retrospect...more of that mid-90s screamo stuff....but they were pretty cool so you might dig it anyway.

but preferably even faster and more nuts. one without any slow parts / breakdowns. a track that just rips from beginning to end and tears itself apart with raw fury. the longer the better. it can even be instrumental but the only caveat is that i don't want deep gurgling vocals like some grind bands have, i want the screechiest most obnoxious vocals possible. although if it has deep vocals and it's crazy enough it'll work i guess. i'm making a short film and i just need something that will make people unfamiliar with the genre shit their pants in terror"

"orchid - chaos is me (1999)","Would you mind describing the difference?"
"orchid - chaos is me (1999)","Powerviolence has gruffer, deeper (read: not screamy) vocals, generally more negative lyrical content, and tends to be devoid of any sort of ""spacey"" guitar effects or mellow parts to a song.  It's the pairing of fast songs with sludgy guitar feel.

Orchid was a product of Western Mass intelligentsia punx.  They went to Hampshire and Amherst, studying postmodern critical theory and applied that to their music and lyrics.  Infest and Spazz probably didn't sit around reading Derrida and Foucault and ruminating on the contemporary social condition of man and if they did, it wasn't an influence on their music.  Powerviolence hates fucking everything."

"Where do I start with Man Is The Bastard?","I like Gourmet Pez and a few other songs but their back catalogue is so large I get a bit overwhelmed. Any essential releases to look out for?"
"Where do I start with Man Is The Bastard?","I personally think their best release is Thoughless... but if you want a good variety check out DIYCD.  Pretty much a compilation of a lot of their split/single stuff and quite awesome.

Also, if you like that, check out later Bastard Noise.  Early BN is a power electronics band but later out it ended up sounding exactly like MITB."
"Where do I start with Man Is The Bastard?","Their split with Crossed Out is what got me into them, and it continues to be my favorite release of theirs. I feel like it's a pretty good representation of what they did; incredibly brutal pv mixed with some incredibly brutal soundscapes. 

ZeroThePenguin is right about the DIYCD (as it includes the crossed out split). That's probably the one to get to decide if you like them or not. "

"My friend and I recorded a shitty little demo on my computer, and I had to chop it up to fit the ten minute.  Try to enjoy anyways.  I'm on guitar and vocs.","I just listened.  I really liked it.  Was it improvised or did you write the songs before recording?  Sounded pre-written, but ya never know.  You should re-record them.

Get some headphone for the drummer, and play a guitar in his ears as he records drum tracks.  [Buy one of these and plug your guitar directly into your computer's mic input](http://i.imgur.com/cayt8.jpg), then record two (or four) guitar tracks for each song, playing the exact same thing for each guitar track.  Then pan them about 50%, one to the left, one to the right.  Then record a bass track, same method, no panning.  Logic can dictate the rest (mixing/mastering), because only you know how you want your music to sound.  You can use the same gear you used to record this demo and it will sound amazing, I assure you.  Tip for when mastering, remove *all* the low end from your guitar tracks.  You do not need bass tones in the guitars at all if you have a bass to play!  Drum mic tip: [if you only use one mic, do](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxcufuj-OCE) this.  Almost any mic will work, even shitty cheap computer mics sound good for punk demos.  Better than some of the 4 track demos we used to hear, anyway!

[iron lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxSixWN8dOE) is quite good, and incorporates a lot of grind as well. if you want bands that blend pv with grind/death, i'd definitely suggest getting into deathgrind, even if you aren't typically a metal head. [assück](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76aoxbmphyY) is the first band that springs to mind, they're probably my favorite deathgrind band ever... if you want something a tad more experimental or ""weird,"" check out [loma prieta's side of their split with raein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqQsftGefDI) (the rest of their discography is hit or miss, but ""iv"" is one of my favorite hardcore records), anything from [man is the bastard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYZDSelgqJY) (extremely groovy noisegrind), or [bucket full of teeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHI96OCms2k) (fuck if i know, i'm not a huge fan of these guys but they are definitely the most ""out there"" pv/grind band i've heard)."

"newbie looking for some new bands","i see where you're coming from, but i'd put them somewhere in the murky area between grind and early screamo. they use a ton of blasts/tempo (especially on the split with raein) shifts which i think make a for a pretty PV/grind-influenced screamo sound."

"Whatever happened to Graf Orlock?","They did break up. ]:

They were supposed to play a fest in my city last year, but they quietly quit a month or so ahead of time. I think they've left it open ended in case they decide to work on Graf stuff again in the future, but as of right now, Graf is dead.

"Whatever happened to Graf Orlock?","You are very mistaken. Stop spreading rumors"
"Whatever happened to Graf Orlock?","Graf Orlock is working on a new full length right now called ""Terraformer"", actually. So broken up is the last thing they are. Also, they JUST played a show with Loma Prieta in Cali not even a week ago.

The reason for their inactivity is that Justin (guitar/vocals) also plays in Dangers, and they trade off summers for tour. For example, one summer Graf will tour, the next Dangers will, and so on. Also, the drummer, Alan, is in law school still I believe

Edit#1: Found the event page for that show Graf just played with Loma https://www.facebook.com/events/540089736085608/

"Whatever happened to Graf Orlock?","Awesome can't wait to hear the new album. "
"Whatever happened to Graf Orlock?","They just played with Loma and Dangers last week"
"Whatever happened to Graf Orlock?","According to Vitriol Records: ""Graf Orlock: Several songs written for the new LP which will certainly be a mindtwisting trip into history’s peanut gallery, “Terrorform.” Lots of conceptual and layout work needed here. So far the songs fucking rip.""

They actually just played recently in La Puenta @ Bridgetown DIY.

Their facebook page is run completely by them, I messaged them a couple of times and received answers back within the day.

"Full of Hell - Fox Womb. Sludge/Powerviolence/Hardcore. Show them some love.","I wouldn't have missed them if I got into hardcore earlier. I literally just became a hardcore and powerviolence kid over a month. I got tired of the nerdery of the metal scene(I'm more metal than you attitude), hardcore was more open minded and fit more with my lifestyle (straight edge, positive). Powerviolence I came to be introduced through hardcore, I had an inkling of that before with grindcore bands like Insect Warfare, Discordance Axis and PxDx and Anb but that was it. I barely listen to metal now except for treasured old school DM releases and occasional tech death."
"Full of Hell - Fox Womb. Sludge/Powerviolence/Hardcore. Show them some love.","I just got this split in the mail the other day, and it's been fucking glued to my turntable. Full of Hell is crazy good- but don't forget about Code Orange Kids. I've known these dudes for years and they've been making solid music since the beginning. Check out the video for the song ""V"" (also on the split with FOH), it's real fucking tight.

Also the label A389 just released a massive MASSIVE free compilation of free music and tracks. 52 tracks to be exact. This label is not bullshit, they don't sign scene core or shitty bands. Fucking INTEGRITY are on this label, Pulling Teeth, Full of Hell, Seven Sisters of Sleep....
