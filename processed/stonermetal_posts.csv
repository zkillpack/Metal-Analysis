"The Sword - Hammer of Heaven","What album is this on?"
"The Sword - Hammer of Heaven","If I'm thinking correctly, the song is from the age of winters era, but didn't have finished lyrics until the last couple of years. It was just released as a single track, not on an album."
"The Sword - Hammer of Heaven","It was recorded during AoW and left off the album. It was later submitted to be put on the Thor soundtrack but was not used. Then they released it as an iTunes single and did a short tour to commemorate it. Red Fang opened, it was a good show. "

"John Garcia's Favorite Albums","I fucking love this guy"
"John Garcia's Favorite Albums","Why? "
"John Garcia's Favorite Albums","I love most of the songs he's in or made, some lyrics hit close to me, and he seems like a really chill guy, and also he played with a lot of bands that aren't much similar beyond being labeled stoner, he just makes songs that I love, specially My Mind, from the new album.  It really hit me since I'm currently having some psychological anger issues "
"John Garcia's Favorite Albums","Now, what's your thought process on Josh Homme?"
"John Garcia's Favorite Albums","I like qotsa's discs except the last one, saw them live once and was completely disappointed by his apparent lack of interest in people having fun, he came in, played the songs and got out. And also the issue with the kyuss name seemed to me like a shitty move. I still like his music and them crooked vultures rocks, but I don't know if I like the guy as a person"
"John Garcia's Favorite Albums","I've liked all of Josh's stuff. Haven't had the chance to see him, but aside from Dweezil Zappa I've not seen a show where that wasn't the case. The Kyuss name I've seen as right; Josh wrote a good majority of the material. I wouldn't want someone else touring under my name without me. It seems we think the same of our idols...I've always seen Josh come off as a really cool guy, mellow and awesome. Honestly I've never liked Garcia's voice. I wish Mark Lanegan or Nick would've sang the Kyuss songs, but I love them as they are. What's your favorite Kyuss album?"
"John Garcia's Favorite Albums","This will probably sound heretic here, but i don't like Kyuss much, i like some songs from it, it's just to slow for my taste. I like what they all did after, it seems to me that Kyuss was something that needed to happen to launch them all"
"John Garcia's Favorite Albums","Burn the witch! Ha, yeah. I dig Kyuss, but, I mean, I love stoner and doom with a passion. I like slow and heavy, or slow and groovy. That Kyuss tone, though, is perfect. As for what they all did after, yeah, Kyuss was pretty necessary. Vista Chino is the bastard son of Kyuss, Songs For The Deaf is the direct evolution. Can't speak too much for where Scott's gone, haven't heard too much from the man but I'd love to see him back writing with Josh."

There are more expensive reusable ones that you can get at music shops that my flatmate swears by.

"American vs British Stoner Metal","It's so hard to come down on one side or another.  I have to say Electric Wizard is probably the most important band, but isn't Sleep the most important band?  I just have no idea."
"American vs British Stoner Metal","No preference between the two really. Completely different though so it's hard to compare, say, Bongzilla to Orange Goblin or Cathedral. It's a big genre in my opinion and to compare the two styles is like comparing Iron Maiden to Eluveitie (Or something of along those lines)
"
"American vs British Stoner Metal","They're good but some bands like kyuss and even bongzilla scream American to me"
"American vs British Stoner Metal","Nope."
"American vs British Stoner Metal","I don't notice a difference."
"American vs British Stoner Metal","What i think he means is Palm desert scene-esc style, verses the more doom metal sound of bands like electric wizard, and more NWBHM sounding bands like cathedral and witchfinder general"

"""Myyyyy naaaaaaammme iiiiiiiiisssss Krullllllllllllllllllll""","Personally I find stuff like Coffinworm, Ishmael, Indesinence or Bison (B.C.) to be more lock-in able for my level of heaviness tastes. To me, Conan's work can seem like random held out notes rather than slow riffs but to each their own. I do respect their level of heaviness and originality but I got their split primarily for Bongripper's work."
"""Myyyyy naaaaaaammme iiiiiiiiisssss Krullllllllllllllllllll""","I can understand that.  I don't like all of their songs, but I am a fan of the majority of their album Horseback Battle Hammer.

"""Myyyyy naaaaaaammme iiiiiiiiisssss Krullllllllllllllllllll""","From any video I've seen it seems like the drummer is playing a completely different beat, and a little faster at that. "
"""Myyyyy naaaaaaammme iiiiiiiiisssss Krullllllllllllllllllll""","Yeah at times he did that, still great though."
"""Myyyyy naaaaaaammme iiiiiiiiisssss Krullllllllllllllllllll""","As a drummer, that kills me hahaha. I understand it, because I guarantee they're playing so loud that if he did the regular beat they might not even hear the rhythm the ride keeps, but I feel like it changes the mood of the song. "

"Black Acid Devil - ""Fire Eater And No Mistake"" Wanted to see what you guys thought of my band.","I would say no offense but on several occasions members of your band have been cunty to myself and friends. On top of, all of you guys have a reputation around Denver of being shady, and you guys know that. It's not like its a secret or anything.

You guys have a killer band, but just not that cool of dudes. Sorry bro. "
"Black Acid Devil - ""Fire Eater And No Mistake"" Wanted to see what you guys thought of my band.","hm. i've never heard that.  sorry if one of us offended you, but i personally can't recall being a douche to anyone. And shady? This is first i've heard that. Ultimately, I am the type of dude that would apologize if i did anyone wrong.  To claim that ""I am aware that we are shady is"" is a bit unfortunate.  What band do ya play in btw?  "
"Black Acid Devil - ""Fire Eater And No Mistake"" Wanted to see what you guys thought of my band.","haha oh well. i am not asking everybody like us, but to call us shady is kinda bullshit.  We came, we played, we checked out the other bands, we got drunk, and not once did we did we do anything shady (that i am aware of). If it was our show, we made sure we could pay the bands.  You have to understand that people spreading lies/slandering us is totally offensive. And it's scene drama which is fucking bullshit."
"Black Acid Devil - ""Fire Eater And No Mistake"" Wanted to see what you guys thought of my band.","im just telling you what's being said and what people think, man. it's not a secret but if you dudes are oblivious to it then i don't know what to tell you. 

for example, i was looking up live videos of you guys one time and someone commented on one with something loosely along the lines of ""kind of funny to watch 4 dudes just fucking up sonically, and i'm not talking about the music."" so it's just something that's out there.

i dig the band, not the dudes. that's all."
"Black Acid Devil - ""Fire Eater And No Mistake"" Wanted to see what you guys thought of my band.","i know what you talking about, and i am pretty sure they were talking about us fuckin up (which we were). To say that we are ""shady"" is a bit out of line, we haven't fucked anyone over, or they haven't been forthcoming. Passive aggression is not rewarded here. Sure it's possible we weren't the coolest people to some people who dealt with us, but we are just PEOPLE who have our good days and bad days. Our rep is all we have besides the music so yes, it is a matter of concern.  Cunty behavior be damned."
"Black Acid Devil - ""Fire Eater And No Mistake"" Wanted to see what you guys thought of my band.","i couldnt say if it was you or someone else. you guys are known for writing sweet tunes but not being the coolest of dudes, and ive experienced it. oh well, not a big deal. but it is a common thing about your rep. maybe get out there and change it."

We've recorded our first full length rock record and are currently still funding it through Kickstarter($1,600 left to raise). We've made a fun video to go along with it and we'd love it you all would take the time and check it out.

Cheers!

"Need helping finding a song, hopefully you dudes can weigh in.","Hey guys I've been getting more into stoner metal lately, starting with sleep about a year ago and going from there into it more. I work at a music store and we get to pick what artists we put on the Business version of pandora but it won't show you the name of the song or band . I've been putting on Red Fang since it's leads to a pretty healthy mix without shitty stuff.  

So here's my thing. I've heard this sweet song a few times now and can't find who it is. I thought it was Baroness but it wasn't and like I said i'm newer to the game. What I remember most is that the chorus (or maybe the bridge) has a half time kind of feel to it and the guitars in the slower part have a rotary speaker kinda mod to them. Otherwise the song clips along nicely with some think guitar tones and deeper vocals.
I know it's vague but hopefully a couple things come to mind for you guys. Thanks in advance"
"Need helping finding a song, hopefully you dudes can weigh in.","My first thought was Mastodon--maybe [Aqua Dementia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Nv0YSGYR0)? There's no Leslie (rotary speaker) effect on the bridge that happens about 2/3 of the way through the song, but it does have an oddly swirly effect compared to the chugging riffery of the rest of the tune.

Definitely sounds like a Mastodon move, and it would definitely come up on a Red Fang playlist. I am not too familiar with their more recent stuff. Maybe this is your excuse to have a Mastodon day and listen to their whole catalog.

EDIT: Also, there's an awesome subreddit called /r/recordstore where people ask these kinds of questions. Definitely check it out."

"Weedeater - Monkey Junction - My Bass Cover/Playalong","Thanks! The bass is made by a Polish luthier about 20 years ago, quite beat up and the frets are pretty much gone - got it cheap, for like 200$. One of the most comfortable neck profiles I've ever played on, somewhere between modern P and J necks, versatile tone too... Beautiful wood, a pic where you can actually see it: http://basoofka.net/files/images/img_0131.jpg"

"Something similar to Electric Wizard?","I'm a little new to stoner and doom metal as subgenres, but over a few months I've been searching for and finding a lot of really solid groups.  Can anybody recommend some bands along the lines of Electric Wizard?  I like Weedeater and Bongripper too, if that helps at all.

Thanks in advance."
"Something similar to Electric Wizard?","Considering Electric Wizard and Bongripper are polar opposites (in my mind at least, though I love them both immensely) in the genre, I'm just going to give you a list of my favorite stoner metal -esque bands.

* Belzebong (groovy and heavy instrumental stoner metal riffage)
* Pallbearer (doom with occasional funeral elements, really epic stuff)
* Sleep (OG stoner metal)
* Om (stretching it esp. with later releases but they're amazing nonetheless)
* Ufomammut (I don't really know how to describe these guys, but stoner metal is only one of many ways you could describe them I guess)
* Kamni (groovy/heavy riffage)
* Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats (you'd think it was written and recorded in the 70s, somewhat along the lines of EW's later releases)"
"Something similar to Electric Wizard?","I saw Om live a few weeks ago and they were fantastic.  One of my favorite bands of any genre.  I also listen to Pallbearer and Ufomammut probably way too much, but those others are new and I'll give them a shot too.  Thanks much."
"Something similar to Electric Wizard?","Bongripper, Bongthrower, Belzebong, pretty much any band with ""bong"" in it.."
"Something similar to Electric Wizard?","[Salem's Pot - Creep Purple](http://youtu.be/5trSbdxwyZE). I love EW and salem's pot comes close, but If you listen to EW when you get high then you should listen to salem's pot when you get higher. The best way I can put it really.

"Instrumental Stoner/Doom","+1 for Earthless! I can listen to 'Lost In The Cold Sun' off of Sonic Prayer for hours on repeat."
"Instrumental Stoner/Doom","'Timing of the Void' by Eagle Claw, and 'Advaitic Songs' by Om are both great choices.

Edit: Should clarify, Advaitic Songs has a little vocals, but it's more chanting than anything really. Timing of the Void is strictly instrumental, however."
"Instrumental Stoner/Doom","I'll check them out, I was already meaning to check out Om, are they always instrumental or is it just this album?"

"Looking for Suggestions","Long Time Lurker here... and now I'm here to ask for some suggestions for some additions to my music library...

I'm looking for something HEAVY with some SWING to it with some BLUES feels hangin' around in it's ether. 

I really dig on C.O.C.'s In the Arms of God
                   Seemless's first record
                   Solace's Further
                   Down's Three Stars record. 

I need some bluesy fat swingin' riffs.. who wants to help a bradah out?"
"Looking for Suggestions","Solace, Beast in The Field, Bongripper, Major Kong, StoneBride, Demon eye and you'd probably enjoy Danzig."
"Looking for Suggestions","Thanks man I'll give 'em a listen! :D"
"Looking for Suggestions","Sounds like you want FUZZ, Child, and some Goatsnake. "
"Looking for Suggestions","add 'em to my list of things to listen too. thanks man!"
"Looking for Suggestions","Kyuss - Welcome to Sky Valley"
"Looking for Suggestions","Wo Fat, Sasquatch, Acid King(to an extent.)"
"Looking for Suggestions","Sasquatch is good... Acid King too! 

I found an act called Wollymammoth... "
"Looking for Suggestions","If you're diggin Woolly Mammoth and COC, I'd make sure you check out The Obsessed, especially The Church Within album - classic of the genre - if you haven't already. Newer bands: Wolf Lord, Youngblood Supercult, Stubb"
"Looking for Suggestions","Orange Goblin and yeah, Goatsnake and FUZZ. If you're up for something more drony (?), check out Mars Red Sky's self titled album. I've been sitting on the floor high many times just listening to that record."
"Looking for Suggestions","I don't think I'm lusting for anything Drony, I've got a good fill on that... 

But I was aiming more for something with a Good Swing to it and heavy on the blues. "
"Looking for Suggestions","I'm not all sure what you mean precisely, but I think you should check out [Beginners Guide to Suicide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEEo-smePjc) by Orange Goblin (and do it anyway, it rocks). That's bluesy!"
"Looking for Suggestions","Yeah, more like this. Please"
"Weedeater - Jason... The Dragon",""
"Weedeater - Jason... The Dragon","1-20 They are playing with Black Cobra in San Diego. It will be the 3rd time I have seen them in the past 2 years!"
"Weedeater - Jason... The Dragon","Thank you for letting me know. this is very important information for me.

"Weedeater - Jason... The Dragon","Let me know if you are going, I may have a extra ticket but idk yet. "
"Weedeater - Jason... The Dragon","gotta love weedeater!"
"Kyuss- Into the Void (Sabbath Cover)",""
"Kyuss- Into the Void (Sabbath Cover)","Wow, I never knew Kyuss covered this song.  Thanks for sharing!  I honestly don't like the vocals quite as much on this cover, but it's still a great version."
"Kyuss- Into the Void (Sabbath Cover)","This is pretty good, but the Soundgarden cover is amazing. I'd link but I'm on mobile. "
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Hey guys,

as the title says, I'm quite new to all this stoner/sludge metal stuff. I've been digging Mastodon and The Sword a lot, so I thought I'd check out more of it. I really like Red Fang, Valient Thorr and Witchcraft. Do you have any more suggestions?

Thanks in advance!"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Clutch. Baroness. Serpent Throne. Big Business. "
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Baroness and Big Business are awesome, the rest is a little too slow for my taste. Thanks man!"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","If you dig Big Business, check out Helms Alee as well. "
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Yes! Helms Alee is righteous."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","This got a little out of hand, but there's no filler in her from my perspective.  I came into this genre from a similar direction as you (Masto, Red Fang, Witchcraft) and I love every one of these albums:

Elder - *Spires Burn / Release* - Given your taste for Masto and The Sword, these guys are RIGHT up your alley.  In fact, get every Elder album.  You need them.

Goatess - self titled - Fuck yes, this album rules.

Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats - *Blood Lust* - Maybe not quite the same genre as these other bands, but you'll love them all the same.  They have two more albums that are also incredible, but this is the easiest to get into.

Gojira - *L'Enfant Sauvage* - A bit of speed/thrash influence, with a little less fuzz and sludge than some of these other bands.  ...and the drums.  Sweet Jesus, the drums!

Graveyard - any of their albums - I'm surprised nobody's mentioned them.  A bit of a bluesy influence.  Of the bands you mentioned, these guys are most similar to Witchcraft.

Anciients - *Heart of Oak* - If you like Mastodon's Remission/Leviathan/Blood Mountain, you'll adore this album.

Mamont - *Passing Through the Mastery Door* - Super fuzzy and fat.  This is a fun album.

Sungrazer  - All their stuff - More of a psychedelic influence.  Vocal harmonies reminiscent of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.  So fuzzy and raw, though.  This band can do no wrong in my opinion.  **Edit - well yes, the one wrong thing they did was break up.  ...so I guess they CAN do wrong.  Fuckers.**

Truckfighters - *Mania* - Almost a pop-like catchiness to their style.  

Vista Chino - *Peace* - This is a polarizing album.  Either you love it or hate it.  I love it.  It's so riffy, and I've always liked John Garcia's voice.

Witch - self titled - The guitar work on this album is stellar.  Such catchy riffs..."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Fuckin' +1 to Truckfighters, saw them back in April and it was one of the sickest shows around.  Gojira too, but I've never really considered them stoner, more... I'unno.  Proggy hardcore?  They're kind of in a genre of their own."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Truckfighters are some of the most down-to-earth guys, too.  Absolutely a class act.  I've never seen them play at a venue and not hang out with fans both before and after the show.  

Yep, Gojira is a bit of a stretch.  But if you like Mastodon and The Sword, I can't imagine not liking Gojira."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Oh man thanks for the effort, I really dig Truckfighters, Graveyard and Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats. I knew Gojira already, but I wouldn't line them up with the rest of the bands. Not chilled enough. :D"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","If chilled is something you're looking for, then you'll definitely like Sungrazer.  Someone else mentioned Baroness, and I'd recommend their latest double album, *Yellow and Green* (not that you could do wrong with their other two fantastic albums, *Red Album* and *Blue Record*)."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Chilled wasn't the right expression, I'm not really into that super slow-drony stuff like Bongzilla or Acid King. I just meant that Gojira is just a little too extreme for my taste at the moment :D.
That being said, Baroness are totally awesome. Kind of like Mastodon, but entirely different."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Cool.  I understand.

I wouldn't put Sungrazer in the same ballpark as Acid King or Bongzilla.  Sungrazer's on the lighter side of the genre.  Some of the psychedelic stuff on *Crack the Skye* comes close to what Sungrazer does.  They're definitely similar to Baroness.  Check out [Yo La Tengo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBE1oIlUO4A).  It's a long song, but when the peaks hit, hold on.  There are a few acts that truly get the idea of delayed gratification.  If you love QOTSA's ""You Can't Quit Me Baby"", you'll get sucked into ""Yo La Tengo"".

Oh man, I forgot to mention Ghost.  I have a hard time placing them in any single genre.  Such talent there, with more than a hint of irony.  Their [Year Zero](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=video&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F62694560&amp;ei=4zm8U6nbFMWL8QHZ2oHoCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3YhMyKl1N9rBRl4UBc0Hfoj3SxQ&amp;sig2=F_dcXFWAws6Nolv_fHj03Q&amp;bvm=bv.70138588,d.b2U) video is pretty epic."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Yeah Sungrazer are a lot less heavy from what I've heard. Yo La Tengo is really good, I'll definitely check them out! :D

Yeah, at first I couldn't stand Mastodon as well, I'll just give it time, maybe I'll get into it once I'm a little more used to the genre.

Ghost are pretty nice, I usually don't dig the orchestral/choir stuff, but they seem to make it work.
"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Gojira is the greatest death metal band in all of death metal land."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","ASG, Kylesa, Kyuss, and High on Fire."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","High on Fire, Kylesa and Kyuss rock, thanks a ton"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Sleep is real good."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Came to say this. And it's not only good, it's definitive."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","No doubt they're definitive.  But I bet they're a difficult listen for OP, given his current tastes.  I love the shit out of Dopesmoker now, but I just didn't understand it a couple of years ago."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","I get what you guys like about Sleep, but I really don't like this super slow drone stuff. It's just too boring for me :/."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","That's EXACTLY how I used to feel about Dopesmoker, and a large swath of stoner doom stuff.  Don't worry about it.  Someday, you may be in the mood to give it a try.  It will always be waiting for you.  For perspective, my progression from QOTSA, Priestess, Kyuss, Mastodon, etc. to Sleep, Acid King, Windhand, etc. took about 5 years.  

Maybe you'll continue down the rabbit hole, and maybe not.  ...but I'm sure that someone like you, who's actively seeking new stuff like you did in this post, will always have his face melted by rad shit, regardless of genre."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Haha, that's true, I just checked out Mastodon a year ago and just yesterday felt in the mood to try them out again. Maybe the same will happen with Sleep or Electric Wizard ;).

Oh, and thanks for helping me out with all this man!"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","I guess I was just struck by how similar your tastes are to my tastes of a couple of years ago.  I still love the stuff I've recommended to you, but like you, I'm continually digesting and distilling new shit to keep me interested.

This just hit me.  Some rainy day when you have a spare 1 1/2 hours, you need to do this:  Watch [this incredibly talented pianist play Mastodon's *Leviathan* straight through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h85KV5e6t-E), and then immediately listen to the real *Leviathan* straight through.  I challenge anyone to not fall head-over-heels for this album after hearing it played so amazingly on piano.

Cheers!"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Electric Wizard - Discography"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Kyuss, Electric Wizard"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Acid King, Bison, Crowbar, Down, Orange Goblin, Priestess, Sasquatch"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Awesome, Down, Orange Goblin and Sasquatch rule! I totally forgot about Priestess, Lay Down is an awesome track! Thanks man"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","You might like Alabama Thunderpussy (they're what started me in the genre). There are a few different incarnations. Their early stuff is pretty sludgy, the last album is a bit more oldschool heavy metal, but the middle stuff is real good Stoner/Southern Metal.

Also maybe Anciients, Scissorfight, Throttlerod, Kalas (Matt Pike from High on Fire singing), Corrosion of Conformity, A Thousand Knives of Fire, Black River, Dala Sun, Freedom Hawk, Ghandi's Gunn, Lowrider, Saviours,  Summoner, Trippy Wicked

There's also some good heavier Stoner Rock bands like Monster Magnet, Fireball Ministry, Fu Manchu, Nebula, Atomic Bitchwax"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Union of Sleep. Little-known German band. Words will not suffice, so here's the proof: [The Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9gVvBzkLtU). I have been collecting sludge for years and this is by far my favourite.
"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Sheavy and Droids attack"
"New to this genre, where do I start?","No one mentioned [Black Pyramid](http://youtu.be/H47pS9j_xqg) my favorite."
"New to this genre, where do I start?","Bongzilla gets no love!  
Also, if you like The Sword check out Saviours!!! And Kvelertak! "
"New to this genre, where do I start?","As some others said Anciients are kickass very similar to Mastodon, We Hunt Buffalo their kinda rock more than stoner but good tunes. Void of sleep out of Italy are pretty badass. Palm Desert from poland, their albums are all kickass and very stoner, you can find them on bandcamp. Happy searching."
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","Is there any way possible (or probable) to put together some sort of kickstart for Giant Squid or something?  I have been listening to them for some time now, and every time is just like the first: amazing.  They do not get the attention they deserve, and I just want to get them more well known.  So is there any way (other than buying albums which I have done) to get them some funds, publicity, internet chatter, anything?  "
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","I just keep telling everyone who asks me about music, how amazing they are. If someone started something I would love to donate because I have the albums but they don't have many shirts anymore either. They should come to Canada!"
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","I'm just trying to get them out of California for now!  I was just looking myself, and they are down to 1 shirt in their store :/"
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","First few albums were fucking awesome. I was really let down by the last one, Cenotes, though. Would donate."
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","All the reviews of Cenotes claim it to be their best effort, and that it is their holy grail.  I disagree.  I would say Metridium Fields and The Ichthyologist are on par, but Cenotes leaves me wanting more."
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","Best bet would be to email them to see if they'll accept e.g. paypal donations.  Kickstarter isn't really set up for that."
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","Nice try, Giant Squid.

No but srsly you guys rock and do probably deserve some moneys."
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","haha, I wish this was really them.  Sadly, this is just an east-coast fan trying desperately to help out a band that makes me feel like I am 13 again."
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","Aaron Gregory also has a set of t-shirts with original drawings he sells through his [Cotton Crustacean](http://www.cottoncrustacean.com/) site.  There was a KickStarter for it last November/December which I backed.

If you follow their Facebook page you can read some news about the band including:


1. Translation Loss is reissuing old GS albums including 2005's Monster in the Creek.

2. Monster in the Creek-era keyboardist Andrew Southard has returned to the band, which may exite those of you who like the earlier sound more than Cenotes. 

3. New songs are being written.

I'm still waiting for the Cenotes vinyl with the comic.  I've never had the opportunity to see them and I'd love to get them to Atlanta so I could."
"For lovers of Giant Squid.","Ok cool, I was looking for the Cotton Crustacean site the other day but when I found it, it just said that all the merch got moved to the Giant Squid site.  I will most likely be buying out of support, would much rather more actual Giant Squid gear.  I follow them on Facebook, so I have been pretty excited about Monster in the Creek (which I have never heard).  And I too eagerly await the comics to be released.  Must be hard to be a visual artist/musician/lyricist/ etc etc etc haha.  Thanks man!"

"Bands Like ASG?","Gonna be really hard. ASG for me, do it better than anyone else. Just keep listening. They have a shit ton of stuff and it is ALL good and it just grows on you. 

BUT. The best I can do: 

1. Crusades (for obvious reasons)
2. Valley of the Sun 
3. Elder
4. Dozer
5. Astrakhan 
6. Baroness 
7. The Sword

Now in my honest opinion, it's telling to me that these bands are the closest that I could find to their sound, and I have been listening to ASG RELIGIOUSLY for the last 7 or so years. I go to all of their shows in Florida, and I have their vinyl. It's a testament to their sound and ability that a kid like me, who knows music and loves ASG, couldn't really find another band exactly like them in any way. 


Added in The Sword. Also, if you find any similar bands in this great quest of yours please let me know about them.

Royal Thunder

Truckfighters

Torche

"My Band Gods Of Space. Some Live demos with Vocal overdubs.","Greetings r/stonermetal ! I grant all of you the opportunity to hear "" The Gods Of Space"" A Stoner/Doom Band from Wilkes-Barre, PA (USA) we hope you like us and on my behalf i appreciate all forms of criticism.  

https://soundcloud.com/godsofspace/sets/basement-sessions
     
here is a TL:DR for what I'm about to say--Drums done w/ one mic,twos guitars=SM57 Bass= Old Cardioid Mic, Vocals=Bleed from PA and overdubs.
      

 I am an Audio engieer and this is my Band :) (no shit get to the point...) So i set us all up for a ""Basement session"" to get demo cuts for an EP we wanna do ASAP. I will be at the helm of the studio. We had a very basic set up in my basement which was a MXL 770 over the whole drum kit that picked up my singing that day and caused bleed on the tracks. We had SM57s on the two Guitars and a beat up Dynamic Cradiod Mic on the Bass Cab. I did Vocal over dubs with the MXL 770. 

Comment and CRIT please :D

"What is the best stoner metal song to listen to baked?","tubes and lots of volume and hellish downtuning is basically their trick...i think theres nothing more important in determining your own sound than lots of tubes, volume and feeling...i see way too many people playing on solid state combo amps these days and wondering why theres no sense of space in their sound. these guys always sound fucking *glacial* to me."
"What is the best stoner metal song to listen to baked?","I play out of a triple rectifier that I scored on craigslist with a matching 4x12 cab. Sounds huge and beautiful and is full of tubes and I play in B standard (BEADF#B). The dude uses some sort of (probably tube?) Peavey combo amp running into one of the beastier Sunn solid state bass heads, and that goes into some EQ rack thing, and all that runs into a mountain of cabs. He has a couple pedals though, gotta know what they are!!!"

"Need some help from ya'll","So the folks over at r/metal are a bunch of elitist douchebags. So I figured I'd find a smaller community not full of dudes still stuck in 1980.

Sorry - had to vent a second. I'm looking for more bands that sound like this in the first 3 minutes.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2KBIs__91s&amp;feature=kp

I'm looking for sludgey and doomish stoner metal. But I don't want it so sludgey it takes forever between notes, I also don't want it so fast I feel like I'm listening to prog, math, or technical.

I want to find some more bands with that heavy brutal and slow feel, foreboding licks that make you headbang real slow.

The kind of music that makes you want to hold up your chalice of blood, roll your eyes back into your head, slap on your metal face and exclaim, ""God damn, that is mean as fuck""

Does anyone know what I mean? And if you do, can you recommend some bands?"
"Need some help from ya'll","Bongripper is awesome.  Make sure to check out their other works too.  Their newer record ""Satan Worshiping Doom"" kicks ass.  If you've never heard [Ufomammut's ""ORO"",](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb-sirShJKw) they are about the closest to that sound.  Love that band.  Also check out [Belzebong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgn9QU60jcA) who are also great.  I just realized these are all instrumental groups, is that what you are looking for?  Enoch is a group that gets over looked quite a bit, who also sound similar (but more fuzzed out) [this is the title track from their record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XzgApiM4ho), it's an instrumental also, but they do have songs where they sing in. [YOB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnijxVBQ1A4) is another group in that same vein. Most of these groups were inspired by the classic Doom groups of the 70's and 80's like [Saint Vitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RCjEdeGmFk) who are still around kicking ass.  And even formed a Doom/Stoner supergroup called [Shrinebuilder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC9oUtrfOiw)  There's a whole world of this stuff out there.  Hang around here.  It's a much nicer place.  I used to think I liked metal until I hung around /r/Metal.  "
"Need some help from ya'll","Yeah man see what I mean. /r/metal is faggotry lol. Thanks btw  I just found yob yesterday - pretty sweet. I already own Satan Worshipping Doom. But now I am all stuck on this Ahab band"

Second, I love Bongripper (and gonna see them on the 21st here in Denver!), and I've been listening to Jucifer non-stop lately. They kinda switch up styles a lot, but are def one of the reigning champs of doom-sludge. It's hard to find one song that encapsulates their sound really well, but smoke a bowl and peep [White Lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqFS37mtOZ0) or [this sick set on NPR,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5132RkO_Sg) of all places.

[Boris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-tUXR_ekBA) does a bit more psychedilia but are still heavier than Oprah Winfrey's ass.

Updates! My good friend and Bassist, Randy Larsen from the legendary noisecore band Cable, has signed on to the new band I am in with Chris Spencer (Unsane), and Keith Kirkum (Weedeater). Chris and I wrote the record this last week and it was an awesome time to say the least. This isn't just messin' around, this is for real. He and I really put our all into making something that moves us and I am really proud of the end result. The next step is Randy and Keith coming to my studio in September to cut the drums and bass. If you know Randy and Keith, they are some seriously heavy dudes and I think their contribution is going to make this album devastating."

On your other comment the equipment being used for drums is a Tama kit, cant remember what kind, but the cymbals I used were a sabian B8 for a ride. A UFIP heavy crash, and Paiste 302 cymbals.

The guitarist played a guitar called a Reverend, I dunno but I think its pretty rare. He puts his guitar through A Boss ME50 and a Hot Cake pedal, its NZ made real crunchy tone. The amp he was using was an amp that was there wasn't ours so I cant remember hahah. Thanks for the replies man. More videos in the sidebar on youtube. Chur."

Why do they let Brann sing?"
"Mastodon - High Road [Official Music Video]","Personally I love Brann's voice.  Remission and Leviathan are amazing records and there's no doubt that they're pursuing a more simple song structure here, but I think it's great that they have songs like Dry Bone Valley and High Road.  Troy's voice recently has become incredibly epic as well.  Let's see how the record is in its entirety, but I understand why you might be upset as an avid Remission fan. "

"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","Hello brothers, so I love Mastodon and they're coming to my city on March, but its a festival so the ticket is kind of expensive and there's just a few other bands that I like in the list, so Im not shure if its worth it. I also heard that Mastodon is not very good live. I want to hear your opinion: Have anyone seen them live? Are they any good? Is it worth it to pay a full festival ticket to see them?

Here's the festival's billboard:
http://www.lifeboxset.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cartel-vive.jpg

Really only interested on Robert Plant, Mastodon, Apocalyptica and Molotov"
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","Intense. Not ideal for viewing on MDMA."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","Not so much seeming live, but on MDMD I concur. "
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I seen em three times.  I was a huge fan of Remission and first saw them when they toured for that.  They were fuckin insane.  It was so heavy and Brann was a monster.   Nowadays, obviously, they've cooled it down a bit and tend to be more rockin.  It's a more chill show, but still pretty amazing.  Brann is still a monster."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","THey are good live, got a chance to hang with them recently on their tour with gojira &amp; kvelertak. Definitely worth seeing, but at a festival you're going to get a shorter set and the sound quality isn't going to be that great more than likely. If you can afford it go for it, but if you can hold out for another show when they are there by themselves, I guarantee it would be more enjoyable"
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I've seen them twice and had a blast both times.

First time around one of them had a broken leg, and they still had tons of energy."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I've seen em twice and they were great for both, the first show especially since it was the crack the Skye tour and they played the album in it's entirety"
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","It depends on the day honestly. I've seen them close to 10 times and sometimes they put on an amazing show and sometimes they are pretty bad. Last time I saw them was in May and they were great. The time before that they sounded awful. It depends on how fucked up Brent is. Also they aren't that good at pulling the newer vocal style off live."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I've seen them twice, both in small venues.  The first was the opening date of the Crack the Skye tour and it was incredible.   On the last tour for Once more round the Sun the sound was y muddled IMHO....Brents guitars wear lost in the mix.....IDK man,  I love seeing live shows but I'm more down with small venues.  (Old metal guy)"
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I've seen them twice. First time is still one of the best shows I've ever seen. They were the headliners. 
Second time I saw them it was crap. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and blaming the venue sound for how terrible it was. "
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","3 times.  twice great, once with so so vocals, but the riffs always seem spot on and are awesome to watch them play.  Brann is a beast as well.  Ive only seen them in small venues.  I dont enjoy festivals, I want the band right in my face."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I've seen them twice (at festivals), once in Canada and once in Australia. Loved it both times, I thought they were great! Would love to have been able to afford to see them at a sideshow to see how their performance compared."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I think their vocals used to suck live, but they have really stepped up their game over the past  few years. They are very tight and on point live."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I saw them twice during the Crack The Skye tour and both times were amazing.

The first they toured with 3 other bands and didn't play but a few ""hits"" after they did the entire CtS album. But it was still amazing.

The second time it was in a smaller venue it was just them and an opener. I was a few people from the stage and it was one of the best smaller venue shows I've ever been too. So loud. So good."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I WOULD GO STRICTLY FOR MOLOTOV! They are an awesomely fun band, and if you like them you will definitely loves them live cause they are pretty wild. Mastodon is cool and all, but Moltov is out of control."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","Chingo yo, changas tu... CHINGA TU MADRE!"
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I think they're pretty phenomenal live, as people have said Brent can sometimes be a bit fucked and though he never seems to miss a note on the guitar his vocals are the teller. I'm impressed that Brann can play those fills whilst singing at all, but sometimes his voice is a tiny bit off too. With a back catalogue like theirs though you're going always in for a rad time. "
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","From all of the friends I had in Florida who ever saw them live... They wouldn't shut about their shows."
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","Seen them 3 times, twice were small venues and they sounded great. The other one was outdoor and the sound wasnt as good but still pretty great live, guess it just depends on how bad you want to see them. Im kinda jealous on Apocalyptica though, would love to see them"
"Has anyone seen Mastodon live, are they any good?","I've seen them 5 times in the Denver area. Each one has been a progressively bigger show both in venue size and audience size. As is obvious on their albums, this band is full of talent and it carries over to their live shows; however, each show I've seen the sound has gotten progressively worse. My favorite show I saw of them was in a small theater in Boulder. They played Crack the Skye in its entirety and it was crisp and clean. It sounded much like the album, but with the added energy of a live show. The subsequent shows just seem to have gotten louder without a care for the mix and the music from the audience's perspective. This is unfortunate. There is so much technical musicianship going on in Mastodon's brand of progressive metal. It's a shame when you know they are up there playing it, but you can't really make it out because the sound is so bad. This has been consistent across three different venues. That being said, there is no arguing they are a great band. I just wish they had better sound at their shows."

i'm a fan of all the mixes, i think they each bring something unique. i'll try to post later with my take on the southern lord version. "
"Sleep- Dopesmoker (new remastered version)","Curious...what do you think of the new remaster?  I may actually like it better than the last....and way better than the Jerusalem mix.  It gets kinda ""Yob-ish"" around the 41 minute mark."
"Sleep- Dopesmoker (new remastered version)","ok i have listened to it twice now through a decent sound system, and i really like it. everything is a lot cleaner than previous versions and heavier at the same time. i haven't listened to the other versions in the last few weeks, so i'm not sure, but it seems like this new mix is more guitar and less drums... it just seems like the drums were off in the distance during most parts, not in your face, but maybe it was the mountain of hash affecting my hearing.

i need to listen to this back-to-back with the last mix to pick up on more of the differences, but overall i think it is an improvement. i'm curious what matt and al think of this version."

Stuff that isn't stoner metal, but still good when you're stoned, Queens Of The Stone Age, Kyuss, Judas Priest, Death, Entombed, Anthrax, Toxic Holocaust, Autopsy, Carcass, Dethklok, and Impaled. I will add to both parts of the list once I go through my library more.


Minor edit: QOTSA and Kyuss might be stoner metal, but I've been told they're more of hard/stoner rock sound than metal."
"I want to get into stonermetal, where should i start?","Sunn O))) is drone metal, not stoner metal, and Boris covers like a million genres. Still highly recommended but you might want to start them on something to the stoner metal side considering both their variety and to give a starting place in their massive discography. Good recs."

"I want to get into stonermetal, where should i start?","Kyuss are more stoner rock. Early QOTSA qualifies as well."

Some of these aren't pure stoner metal, but withdraws influences from psychedelic and doom. But all these bands has three things in common: heavy, slow and awesome riffs.


Edit: make sure you listen to Sleep's Dopesmoker/Jerusalem and pretty much everything by Om, especially Conference of the Birds, At Giza... that song, holy hell.

"A demo of a song my band is working on. Vocals to come. How do we sound?","You know what? At first I was like, ""Well the recording is a bit muddy and I can't necessarily pick everything out."" Then I sat and listened and started really picking out the individual riffs, even the bass is riffing, and got the feel for the double bass. This shit is spicy. I really groove to it. Can't wait to hear the vocals. Just turn up the left guitar in the mix a bit. "
"A demo of a song my band is working on. Vocals to come. How do we sound?","Thanks for the kind words! These are practice recordings that exist mostly for the purpose of writing, so they are sloppy; but everything is sort of glued together and layered on purpose. There is a guitar track doubling the bass verbatim. I just like that silky smooth nastiness.

I think the vocals will be blackened and light-handed, but who knows. We are coming up with this shit as we go. This is my first band, even though I've been playing forever and I am way too old for this to be my first real project."
"A demo of a song my band is working on. Vocals to come. How do we sound?","I had the same reaction! It first sounds overly muddy, but it doesn't take long until you really get into it. Good job with the layering OP!

"The Sword - How Heavy This Axe","Bullshit. Seen them live twice, and they're great. The singer doesn't dance around and shit, no, but he lets the music speak for itself. And it speaks volumes live."
"The Sword - How Heavy This Axe","my buddy said they sounded like a crap judas priest cover band live. they're awesome recorded
"
"The Sword - How Heavy This Axe","Thats crazy talk as i've seen them live and they sounded better than the album. "
"The Sword - How Heavy This Axe","They sound as good as the venue they're playing allows but the solos are always the same as on the record and the guys just stand in place playing your favorite songs.  No flair, nothing I cant get from buying a live CD.  

I go to shows to see performers, not guys playing my favorite songs.  It's also nice to be surprised by a reworked song or solo. "
"The Sword - How Heavy This Axe","Why the fuck would you go to a show and expect improvisation? Go to a guitar clinic then you dumbass. "
"The Sword - How Heavy This Axe","Doesnt need to be improvisation but most bands get bored playing the same solos and arrangements they recorded years ago and start to change it up a bit.  Not with the Sword and it's something I see meaning they're great at writing songs but not creative enough to improve on them .  Contrast this with a band like Deerhunter who I've seen 5+ times over the last 6 years, they have a few songs that are completely different each time you hear them and thats even just tour to tour, some of the songs are a good bit away from how they were originally recorded on the album.  

They play songs the exact same way they're recorded and thats awesome but I like to see a band do more than that.  Anybody can practice a song enough to play it perfectly live, a true artist can improve on the song in a live situation.

Or in keeping with a metal band similar to the Sword, the Truckfighters rock live.  The solos are all different than on the album and most of the songs are reworked and improved.  Majestic is drawn out to be a 20+ minute epic journey other songs are just restructured to allow a solo or more crowd interaction."
"The Sword - How Heavy This Axe","Most metal bands are not jam bands. "
"The Sword - How Heavy This Axe","They dont need to be jam bands to change around their tunes over time.  Baroness and Mastodon have done this to a large degree when playing older songs nowadays, they change things up to keep songs fresh.  Zoroaster is another great example of a band that likes to rework their live songs, sometimes to the point of barely recognizing them but still adding to the live show.  

Here's a great example:
[Zoroaster - Spirit Molecule from their album Voice of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xaZy96h9i8)

[Zoroaster - Spirit Molecule Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpTpJMvY_o)

Not too different but obviously changed up enough to where they're seeing the song as something living and dynamic that can be improved upon or played with.  

It's just dull to play the same solo you recorded on a record for the next five years.  Punk bands change things up, indie bands change things up, most metal bands stay the same."
